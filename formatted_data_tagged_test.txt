<|startoftext|> The Pools of Youth <|obj|> Obtain some of the Water of Youth.  <|text|> North! Go north to the Pools of Youth. Get some of the water but be on your guard. The mogu list this as a "high value" target. Kang Bramblestaff will meet you there if he has not already arrived by your side.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Highland Fishing <|obj|> Greetings, friend! I see you're getting to know the ways of tuskarr, and thus the ways of the fish.  <|text|> Greetings, friend! I see you're getting to know the ways of tuskarr, and thus the ways of the fish. If you'd like, I could make you something that will allow you to tackle fishing in the highland pools of the Dragon Isles. Think you're up for the challenge?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Darkshore Donations: XA-1000 Surface Skimmer <|obj|> Gather 2 Monelite Ore to Brandal Darkbeard in Boralus Harbor.  <|text|> Ye look like the kind o' <lad/lass> that ought ta be carryin' loads o' ore around with ya! If my assumption is right about ye, we could use yer help to gather a bit more ore for the war effort.

Have ye any ore ta spare?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Western Flank <|obj|> Kill 10 Shattered Hand Guards, 10 Shattered Hand Berserkers, and 5 Shattered Hand Acolytes, then report to Lieutenant Amadi at Honor Hold's western guard tower.  <|text|> In addition to other instructions, the orders tell the remaining fel orcs to prepare their equipment and rations for a coming attack. According to the plans, Warboss Nekrogg's forces are to form the western flank of a pincer attack on Honor Hold. With the hold's garrison concentrating on its eastern walls, an attack from the west would be devastating. Honor Hold can only hope to hold out if the western forces are kept out of the battle.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Worthy Weapon <|obj|> Bring the Blade of Drak'Mar to Magister Edien Sunhollow at the Argent Tournament Grounds.  <|text|> Our champions have taken a liking to ancient weapons produced here in Northrend. I've heard the bards telling tales of travelers offering winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to the circle of lamps in Drak'Mar Lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills. Ask the lonely maiden for a worthy blade.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fire in the Hole!  <|obj|> Slay Grolvitar the Everburning.  <|text|> Land's sakes, pardner! You done shut off those valves but good. Unfortunately we've had a critical blowout in our gosh-darned central burnoff regulator! Missus Darla's done sent as many workers as she can rustle to go shut it off, but those flames have a mind of their own! Literally! They're hoppin' up and grabbin' anyone who comes near! So Darla says if you can muster up out of that cave you're in and beat that elemental, she's got a mighty fine prize in store for ya!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Intercept the Reinforcements <|obj|> Vindicator Kaalan at the Sun's Reach Armory wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker and fly over the Dawnblade reinforcement fleet.  <|text|> We're making a push to solidify our control of Sun's Reach by capturing the harbor next.  Unfortunately a fleet of Dawnblade reservists is on its way to reinforce Kael's forces there. Take this oil and secure a dragonhawk from Ayren Cloudbreaker.    You should be able to fly within reach of the ships' sails; once you're close enough, set them on fire. Land in one of the ships and attack the reservists.  With their ship sails on fire they won't be able to mount much of a defense.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Nature's Touch <|obj|> Heal 5 Injured Druids in Impsorrow Approach.  <|text|> Apparently we're not the only druids that have run into these demons. The Legion took a ton of captives and brought them back to their camp. Our brothers and sisters lay wounded and hurting. . . You can heal! Let's go save them!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Further Concerns <|obj|> Marshal Dughan wants you to speak with Guard Thomas.  <|text|> If you are concerned that the rumors of murlocs are true, then do this -- travel to the eastern Elwynn bridge and speak with Guard Thomas.  He has been stationed at the bridge for the past week and will know the state of the area. I have here a Stormwind charger that will take you to Guard Thomas. Let me know if you wish to make use of the horse.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cymre Brightblade <|obj|> Defeat Cymre Brightblade in a pet battle.  <|text|> I found some interesting artifacts on a recent dig, and I'd love to put them through their paces to see how they would have performed in their native cultures.  Don't suppose you have anything small and furry that can put up a fight?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rolo's Riddle <|obj|> Solve the riddle.  <|text|> <Another dirty scrap of parchment is buried beneath the soil. >Somewhere hope stands, wings held forth
From its feet turn to the north
Pass beyond an ancient gate
Behind a stone pair, I await.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Corruption Runs Deep <|obj|> Recover an Essence of Corrupted Soil and an Essence of Corrupted Water from the caverns beneath Deadwind Pass.  <|text|> Everything the Legion touches is marred by fingerprints of their corruption. If I can study the traces of magic they leave behind, perhaps I can discern their plans for Karazhan. This vial is specially reinforced to contain fel magic. If you bring me the essences of corrupted soil and water from near their portals, I believe we'll be closer to unraveling their scheme.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wanted: Gath'Ilzogg <|obj|> Kill Gath'Ilzogg and bring his head to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire for the reward.  <|text|> Wanted! Gath'Ilzogg, Leader of the Blackrock attacks on Stonewatch Keep and raids against the township of Lakeshire. Gath'Ilzogg is extremely dangerous.  He is reportedly holed up in the recently conquered keep plotting the Blackrock clan's further crimes against humanity.  The orc infestation must be quelled at all costs.  A gracious reward will be given to whatever brave soul can deliver the head of Gath'Ilzogg to Magistrate Solomon.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Crushing the Crown <|obj|> Kill 5 Crown Dusters and use Snagglebolt's Khorium Bomb to destroy one chemical wagon just outside of Hillsbrad Village in Hillsbrad Foothills, then return to Inspector Snip Snagglebolt in Stormwind.  <|text|> This ledger is full of locations, and I need you to investigate and take action, pal. This has gone on long enough. Here's an entry I want you to check out: it's just outside the village of Hillsbrad in -- you guessed it -- Hillsbrad Foothills. That can't be good. Get out there and rough 'em up. Oh, and if you see something big and dangerous enough that it needs destroying, toss this bomb at it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Upper Hand <|obj|> Defeat Scalecommander Sarkareth.  <|text|> It troubles me that Dezran would sacrifice himself so willingly for Sarkareth. . . And that Amythora and Marithos would leave Dezran to save him.

We both know the loss of waking in a new world. But Sarkareth wallows in the darkness of our past. I cannot let him continue to recruit our people.

Sarkareth awaits in the next room. I do not wish to kill him, but we must bring him to justice.

Let me know when you are ready.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Summit of Fate <|obj|> Collect 8 Spider Idols from the Vilebranch at the summit of Jintha'Alor.  <|text|> You've done well cleaving through their warriors, <name>. I'd like you to investigate the summit of Jintha'Alor. We were prepared for our fiercest battle there, to storm their dark altar, but it's too quiet. Not a sound. It could be a terrible trap, and someone strong should look into it first instead of all of us rushing in. And if it's not a trap. . . I'm very interested in finding out what happened up there. Bring me back any clues you can find.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Glyphed Oaken Branch <|obj|> Based on the magic enchanted within the Glyphed Oaken Branch, its delivery to the Cenarion Circle in Thunder Bluff is the next step the tauren druid sought.  <|text|> The lifeless hand of the tauren druid clutches a surprisingly healthy looking oaken branch.  Examining the branch reveals glyphs of a druidic nature carved into the bark. As you grasp the branch, you notice it is warm to the touch, more than it should be.  The image of Thunder Bluff in Mulgore enters your mind - Elder Rise specifically - and the words "Cenarion Circle" are on the tip of your tongue.  It would appear that the suggestion of where to take the branch has been placed within it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wanted: Rift Lords <|obj|> Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to kill 4 Rift Lords.  <|text|> Mah'duun knows where you must go. Mah'duun knows that you must kill rift lords. But, Mah'duun does not know exactly when. I know that does not make sense, but the voice on the winds was not more specific. Travel to the Black Morass through the Caverns of Time and the way shall be made clear.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Debt That Must Be Paid <|obj|> Find Baine in the Ohn'ahran Plains.  <|text|> <name>, I have heard you cultivated good relations with the centaur of the Ohn'ahran Plains. I would like to ask a favor.

Baine left for the plains a few days ago in search of a group of missing tauren. I offered to accompany him, but he insisted on going alone.

The tauren of Thunder Bluff have a long and bloody history with the centaur of Kalimdor, as does Baine. While the Maruuk centaur are unrelated, I still have my concerns.

Your presence could help smooth tensions. I hope.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mu'gra's Head <|obj|> Not far from here is a hippo of unusual size and ferocity known as Mu'gra.  <|text|> Wow! Look at the size of that thing. . . that's got to be the biggest hippo I've ever seen! Mu'gra was one of the angriest hippos I've ever seen, but she's all smiles now! Get it? Hippo teeth. . . smiles. . . eh, eh?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Auchindoun and the Ring of Observance <|obj|> Take your orphan, Dornaa, to the Meeting Stone at the Ring of Observance in the middle of Auchindoun.  <|text|> One of the priests that comes to visit told a story about a place nearby.  It's called Auchindoun, and it's supposed to be very important to the draenei. He said it used to be the place where the bodies of the draenei were taken when they died.  But some time ago, something bad blew it up. I'd like to see its Ring of Observance.  The orphan matron told me that it is in the middle of the Bone Wastes, on the south side of the Terokkar Forest. Please, <Mr. /Miss> <name>, can we go?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Half-Ton Holdouts <|obj|> Slay 12 Dustbelcher Combatants.  <|text|> I'd say we have a dragon problem, but it seems like they're a little more interested in New Kargath than they are in our small encampment.  Nevertheless, I've got top men focused on keeping the dragons at bay. One problem that has gone unchecked, however, is the ogre camp to our southwest.  A small army of combatants seems to have appeared outside of their hovel. We can't sit and wait for them to flank us, soldier.  Thin their ranks before they thin ours.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Root of the Problem <|obj|> Kill the Coldbite Matriarch.  <|text|> Kypari Zar is dying. A creature of terrible darkness corrupts it from deep beneath its roots. The tree cannot be saved, but at least we can lessen its pain. Look. The vile creature has carved a path to its own lair. We need only follow it down the hill, just behind this tower.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hidden Dealings <|obj|> Explore the location marked on the Crude Map.  <|text|> <Among her possessions, the witch carried a crudely drawn map of Arom's Stand. 

A symbol marks what looks like the entrance to a cellar beneath one of the buildings.

If this location is important to the coven, it might be worth scouting out. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Thinning the Ranks <|obj|> Kill 12 Dragonflayer Huscarls and return to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge.  <|text|> There's a flurry of activity down in Voldrune village to the south. Thane Torvald Eriksson and his huscarls are preparing for war. With most of our men in the field dealing with the Horde's treachery, Amberpine will be vulnerable. Travel to Voldrune, which is near the southern coast, and show those Dragonflayers we're no soft target. Slay as many of the huscarls as you can find. Make them think twice about taking advantage of our conflict with the Horde.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Spread the Word <|obj|> Use the Scouting map and complete "Spread the Word.  <|text|> Now that you have recruited your champions, you can use the Scouting Map to complete vital missions across the Broken Isles. The first mission is critical to the growth and power of our order. Send Nazgrim and Thassarian to seek out new candidates for the Ebon Blade. Our order must grow in strength if we are to defeat the Burning Legion.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wriggling Mass <|obj|> Locate someone who can explain the visions.  <|text|> <The tendril writhes and pulsates in your hand as your mind is assailed by all manner of vicious thoughts.

One vision in particular surfaces in your mind again and again.

In your mind's eye, you picture a many-eyed goat laying in a pool of black water. As you approach, its eyes burst open, and in an instant you find yourself looking upward at the goat from deep within the puddle.

As you sink into the icy darkness, everything goes black.

You pocket the mass and shake the thoughts from your head.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> What's in the Box?  <|obj|> Assist with Aethas and Rommath's experiment.  <|text|> We are trying to uncover the secrets of one of the mogu artifacts Garrosh insisted we investigate. It is proving most difficult, as anyone who probes it magically is greatly affected by raw, negative emotions. I called in the assistance of Arch-mage Aethas of the Sunreavers in the hopes that he and Rommath could crack this puzzle. They asked for you specifically - apparently you have some relevant experience? Go to the chamber below Farstrider Square east of here and see if you can assist them.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Picking a Side <|obj|> Choose a loa.  <|text|> Look, dis has gone on long enough, $p. I am not one to hold a grudge, but I will be damned if I let you double dip with Raal's loa and my own. Time has come to pick a loa. De loa are not de sharing type.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Halls of Valor: Revenge of the Enchantress <|obj|> Retrieve Tigrid's Enchanting Rod from the Halls of Valor and return it to her in Stormheim.  <|text|> For many centuries, even after death, I was capable of weaving enduring enchantments. But since the theft of my enchanting rod by a greedy king, I can barely sustain the little magic I have left. If you can recover my enchanting rod from the god-king's ghost, I will reward you in kind.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bark for the Barleybrews!  <|obj|> Spread the word about Brewfest at the flags outside the bank, in the Military Ward, in the Hall of Explorers and in the Mystic Ward.  <|text|> We need to get the word out about the Barleybrews at Brewfest.  You need to shout at the flags outside the bank, in the Military Ward, in the Hall of Explorers and in the Mystic Ward.  I'll make things easy though, I'll lend you a racing ram for 4 minutes.  Use the reins to let him go, but try not to tire him out.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Death by Proxy <|obj|> Speak with "Cookie" McWeaksauce at Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in Stonetalon Mountains.  <|text|> Can you hear them fighting down below, <name>? It would appear that the Grimtotem tauren are no longer in the good graces of the Horde. I don't know what happened, but we can turn this to our advantage. I will arrange a meeting with an ambassador from the Grimtotem. What I need you to do is put together a peaceful offering. < Force Commander Valen points to Cookie. >Talk to "Cookie, " <name>. He's already been briefed on what we need to do.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Supplies for the Other Side <|obj|> Obtain 7 Blueroot Vines.  <|text|> One of the biggest dangers that our druids face when fighting within the Firelands is simple dehydration. Our proveditors spend a significant amount of time preparing canteens for the troops on the other side. We do have other methods, however. In the greener thickets to the east, you should still find some blueroot vines which have not yet burned. These plants hold a tremendous amount of water in their roots - and also provide some energy for the weary soldier.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Flame Crest <|obj|> Report to Kibler at Flame Crest in Burning Steppes.  <|text|> Our work here in Chiselgrip is done, mostly thanks to you.  We'll now be moving on to the northeast, to Flame Crest. Flame Crest is in the cliffs, past the Ruins of Thaurissan.  It should serve as a sufficient base of operations for the final stages of our plan. Of course, my son Ariok will be joining you on the road.  As will I.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Coldtooth Supplies <|obj|> Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the Alliance Quartermaster in Dun Baldar.  <|text|> The Coldtooth mine is a storage depot for the Horde.  I can't stomach the food they give their troops, and the state of their arms and armor is atrocious!  But. . . in times like these when supplies are so important, we can use what they have. Enter the Coldtooth mine and bring me back their supplies.  That will help keep the Alliance in fighting shape, and remove much needed equipment from the Horde's warriors. Good luck, <name>.  The mine is to the distant south, deep in Horde territory.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Return to Corporal Kaleb <|obj|> Bring Krazek's Fixed Pot to Corporal Kaleb at the Rebel Camp.  <|text|> While you were gone I fixed the pot you brought me.  I even added an extra steam whistle, and look!  There's a new chopper at the bottom that'll cut through leg bones! Yes yes, Krazek 's Crock Pot is a 100% cook pleaser!  I'm sure its owner will be satisfied.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bluewolf the Elder <|obj|> Your spirit burns with life, young &lt; class&gt; .  <|text|> Your spirit burns with life, young <class>.  I accept the homage you pay, and offer in return this token. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Arp the Elder <|obj|> Your spirit burns with life, young &lt; class&gt; .  <|text|> Your spirit burns with life, young <class>.  I accept the homage you pay, and offer in return this token. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Making the Horn <|obj|> Nokoma Snowseer at Camp Winterhoof wants you to bring her 6 Undamaged Ram Horns.  <|text|> My people have been hunting the giant yeti of these hills for generations and I will be participating for the first time this year. It will probably be the last before we leave the post forever. To prepare for the hunt, I must fashion a loud horn from the horns of the dire rams that roam the snowy areas near our camp. The elders tell me the sound mimics the mating call of the female yeti, but I have my doubts. Bring me the best dire ram horns you can find, <name>, and I'll select one from among them.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Corrupted Night Dragon <|obj|> You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a night dragon plant.  <|text|> You apply four Cenarion plant salves to the night dragon.  It immediately begins to shed its corrupted form, blossoming into a vibrant and healthy plant. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(4448)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Securing the Province <|obj|> Kill 10 Wildscale Saurok or Wildscale Herbalists in Zhu Province.  <|text|> With our grip on the province loosening, saurok from the wilds have already moved in to the cave just north of town. Most of our hunters are face-down in their own tears, so the saurok just walk in here like they own the place and grab whatever they want! I want to send a message that Zhu's Watch is not to be crossed. Will you be my messenger?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ethereum Secrets <|obj|> Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to bring him an Ethereum Prisoner I.  <|text|> <Ameer holds up a tag. >I found this prisoner I. D. tag with the remains of the fallen vanguard. I can only assume that all of their prisoners are tagged in the same manner. I'm going to start cataloguing the tags in hopes of making sense of their penal system. If in your adventures you find more Ethereum prison keys, you can use them to open the Ethereum prisons at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - directly south of here. Bring me back any and all I. D. tags that you find.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Boon of A'dal <|obj|> Return to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown.  <|text|> I am pleased that you have come to me, <name>. I know of Crusader Bridenbrad, and of your travels in hope of saving him. Bridenbrad's valor has sparked remarkable selflessness in you, and this is a miracle unto itself. The Light will take care of its own. I will extend my blessing to Bridenbrad and he shall not endure the corruption of undeath. I shall return you to Dalaran, and you shall return to him. Know that I remain with you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Delivery for Orendil <|obj|> Deliver the Bag of Bathran's Hair to Orendil Broadleaf at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale.  <|text|> Quickly, <name>. I will put the Bathran's Hair into this bag, but you must deliver it to my master, Orendil Broadleaf. You will find him at Maestra's Post, just south down the road on the left. But beware, we've received reports that the post is under attack from the Horde!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Keeper's Favor <|obj|> Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle has requested that you secure passage from Arch Druid Lilliandra and speak to Keeper Remulos in Moonglade.  <|text|> There are those of this world that tap into power unrestricted by the bounds of our mortal frames - powers of restoration, powers of life, and powers of light.  And Bridenbrad, this is no ordinary man. . . his valor and devotion shine through. We can only hope that one of these beings will intervene and bring this hero back from a fate worse than death. Go now and speak to Arch Druid Lilliandra in the Argent Vanguard. . . request passage to Moonglade and seek the aid of Keeper Remulos.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Visit to the Curator <|obj|> Etaruk, on the outskirts of the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to kill Curator Insivius.  <|text|> The leader of the mage hunter forces is a fearsome creature called Curator Insivius. My people have hunted the beasts of the seas and land for countless generations, but I've never seen anything like this curator before. He's landed one of those flying disks on the upper rim of the quarry and oversees the operation from there. <name>, I can only believe the ancestors themselves sent you to my rescue and I hope you will help me drive the mage hunters from this quarry once and for all.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Invader's Scourgestones <|obj|> I doubt I need to give you the entire spiel about scourgestones, &lt; name&gt; , so I will cut to the chase.  <|text|> Another batch of scourgestones from my best buddy, <name>! Thanks as always, these will go great with the rest of my hoard. Keep this up, and I will need to find a new place to stash them! Here's a token for your trouble. I like this little back and forth trading game we got going on here. Let's keep it up. But no, I am still not telling you what they're for.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Death From Above <|obj|> Sergeant Hammerhill wants you to use the Reinforced Net to help you slay 6 Scourged Flamespitters outside of Valiance Keep.  <|text|> We're doing a good job of holding the front lines against these bugs.  Some of these cheeky fiends, however, can fly over the aforementioned front lines and are really beating down on our inner defenses. I've requisitioned reinforced fishing nets from our civilian ships.  If you've got a good enough throwing arm, they'll help you knock the enemy out of the sky.  Thin their numbers so that our defenses can hold the keep.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Warrior's End <|obj|> Speak with the strange ghost at the Darkmaul Bridge.  <|text|> Hey, <name>! You're a <class>, right? Maybe you can deal with this. . . situation.

I was scouting the area with Lindie's device and saw a ghost who was offering power to any "true" warriors.

I know you're still new at this, but why don't you try going over there? 

We could use every advantage against these ogres.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tools of the Enemy <|obj|> Retrieve 8 Paint Soaked Brushes.  <|text|> The hozen have stolen our brushes and are painting over our scrolls of wisdom with their own wisdoms, if you can call them that. If you're here to help, stop them and bring our brushes back before they can do more harm.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Freya's Pact <|obj|> Listen to what the Avatar of Freya has to say.  <|text|> The cultists have been taken care of, but the Scourge's invasion has not slowed down.  The situation is becoming desperate, <name>. There exists a last resort.  Before I reveal any more, however, I must be sure I have your absolute trust.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Barrens Port <|obj|> Speak with Wharfmaster Dizzywig at Ratchet in the Barrens.  <|text|> Ratchet is the only port in the Barrens. Most likely Velinde found a trading vessel in Ratchet to take her to Blackwater Cove in Azeroth. We've had limited dealings with the goblins that run the port, but the master of the dock should have information about the comings and goings of ship passengers. Follow the road southeast through Ashenvale and you will find yourself in the Barrens. Watch your step, <name>, warriors of the Horde patrol the land. You will be safe at the port, though.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Slow-roasted Turkey <|obj|> Make 5 Slow-Roasted Turkeys and bring them to Francis Eaton near the gates of Orgrimmar.  <|text|> Every Pilgrim's Bounty feast requires a centerpiece, and for us, that's a slow-roasted wild turkey. I can't think of anything better to bring the meal together. There's a good recipe for it in your bountiful cookbook. Why not hunt some wild turkeys and prepare a few? The turkeys wander all over Tirisfal Glades, so you shouldn't have a problem finding any. Once you're done roasting them, will you bring them to Francis Eaton outside Orgrimmar?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Down by the Riverside <|obj|> Sail down the river with Talanji and defend the Gob Squad's A.  <|text|> We have de aid of Krag'wa and de Gob Squad. We must get back to Zul'jan and begin our plan to stop de blood trolls.

De two of us will ride with dem and ensure de blood trolls do not destroy de mech.

I will run ahead and get de boat ready near de riverbank. Meet us dere.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The End of the Line <|obj|> Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under Lake Indu'le.  <|text|> Within his robes you find two things of interest. One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named Sidragos, which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the Moonrest Gardens. The water-soaked parchment informs Goramosh that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine. Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> In the Blink of an Eye <|obj|> Witness the teleportation of Dalaran to the Broken Isles.  <|text|> <The entity speaks with the familiar voice of Archmage Khadgar. >Azeroth needs you, <name>! After scouring Ulduar and Karazhan for answers, we know the key to defeating the Legion: five ancient artifacts called the Pillars of Creation. To find them, Dalaran must be moved to the Broken Isles. As our leader Jaina is. . . absent, Kalecgos of the blue dragonflight has offered the Kirin Tor his aid. The Legion is assaulting our current position over Deadwind Pass. Hurry!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Tome of Divinity <|obj|> Search the outer ring of Ironforge for John Turner.  <|text|> Your task then, <name>, is to find someone here in Ironforge that is in need of aid. Someone who is pure of heart and motive. Perhaps someone helping others. Perhaps someone in need of a guide. Regardless, the person must have noble intent and be relying on your kindness. Do this, and return to me when you are finished. Then, we shall discuss more of your path and what it means to be a paladin of the Light. I will remain here in the temple for your return. Other paladins will need my guidance also.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Apothecary's Letter <|obj|> Bring the Sealed Letter to Andello Porter at Tabetha's Farm.  <|text|> Recovered from the body of a Forsaken apothecary, this letter contains alarming evidence of a close alliance between the Grimtotems and the new masters of Lordaeron. "As a demonstration of good faith and a symbol of our newfound trust, we have dispatched Apothecary Cylla to aid you in battling our mutual enemy in the land of Kalimdor. None will stand before our combined might and determination. "This letter should be brought to the attention of the SI: 7 agent at Tabetha's Farm, Andello Porter.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Lycanthoth the Corruptor <|obj|> Use Lycanthoth's Incense within the Maw of Lycanthoth in Hyjal to summon and kill Lycanthoth.  <|text|> I think I understand what's happening here. The Twilight's Hammer fears that the ancients may someday rise up to oppose them. They'll do anything to stop the return of Goldrinn. This " Lycanthoth " is a twisted version of our beloved wolf god, summoned by the Twilight's Hammer to replace him. Bah! It is but a shadow of Goldrinn's power. <name>, kill this beast so that the true ancient can return. Take this incense and burn it in the Maw of Lycanthoth east of here. Slay that beast and free Goldrinn!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker <|obj|> Speak with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind's Cathedral District.  <|text|> The time has come, <name>, for you to learn about what it will take for you to acquire something you have no doubt waited on for some time. . . your charger. Speak with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind's Cathedral District.  It is he who will guide you not only though the legerdemain of a Paladin's most trusted mount, but the tasks before you to acquire one of your own. I wish you the best in this trial.  For the Light, noble <brother/sister>!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> One Battle at a Time <|obj|> Complete 10 World Quests.  <|text|> Before I  became a demon hunter, I practiced the arcane arts. I still retain some of that knowledge, though the fel makes it all but impossible to use.

One thing I can still manage is the occasional glimpse into faraway places. You've seen me use the nether crucible to do this. I'm afraid that things don't look too good.

The forces that are arrayed against us are not limited to the Burning Legion. You must act quickly to keep the Broken Isles from being overwhelmed.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Great Akazamzarak <|obj|> Place the Sizeable Pouch of Gold in Akazamzarak's tip bucket.  <|text|> There is a goblin who is a master of portals and teleportation by the name of Akazamzarak. His talents have gone mostly unnoticed, however, since he mostly uses them for chicanery.

He is, what you would call, a street performer.

Fortunately for us, he is performing in the streets of Dalaran, grifting coins from the unenlightened masses.

Take this bag of gold. See if you can convince him to change vocations.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Crystal Clarity <|obj|> Collect 1 Pristine Crystal Shard from the Crystal Spine Matriarch on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale.  <|text|> You know, there is a way we can improve your S. E. L. F. I. E. cam, if you're interested. With the right focusing lens, I could add all kinds of features to that thing.

I've heard that way out on old Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale, the mother of all basilisks has been seen. Her hide is dotted with gems that'd make the perfect lens, if I could get my hands on them.

She's not going to go down easy, though. You might want to bring some friends along.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Step into the Dark <|obj|> Speak with Navarrogg at Stonedark Grotto.  <|text|> With the threat to my people quelled, I believe it is time to introduce you to my kin.

Meet me at Stonedark Grotto, and you will see where we live.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hunting Huln <|obj|> Don a disguise then search Dominance Keep for Huln Highmountain while avoiding the guards.  <|text|> Huln is somewhere in the area, but the Stonewright isn't letting anyone in to her territory because of the recent, ah, troubles with Dreadlords. The guards won't let anyone in, and they're kicking out anyone who doesn't look like they belong.

Luckily for Huln, Cudgelface and I came up with a foolproof plan!

We just need to look like we belong and then we can ask around and find Huln. Easy!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Twisted Hatred <|obj|> Kill Lord Melenas and bring his head to Tallonkai Swiftroot in Dolanaar.  <|text|> I must warn you, <name>, this matter must stay between us. The satyr are enough of an embarrassment to us already, and this one is much too close to home. He is called Lord Melenas. He resides in the nearby cave of Fel Rock where he has gathered a large group of grell warriors. His heart is black as night, and he plots something most foul. You must find him within his nearby cave just to the north of here, and bring me his head.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Solving the Mystery <|obj|> Bring the Mysterious Challenge Card to Brawl'gar Arena to confront Boss Bazzelflange's captor.  <|text|> <Bazzelflange produces a challenge card from her pocket. >

I grabbed this challenge card from my attackers while we were fighting each other! I'm sure that you can use it to challenge my attacker to some sort of ultimate showdown!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dragon Isles Jewelcrafting <|obj|> Are ye the new jewelcrafter I asked for? &lt; Falron looks you over.  <|text|> Are ye the new jewelcrafter I asked for? <Falron looks you over. >Perhaps not, but ye are a jewelcrafter. You will do. I will teach ye how to cut the gems of the Dragons Isles, since you're here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Call of the Archmage <|obj|> Speak with Archmage Khadgar at Khadgar's Tower in Zangarra.  <|text|> Archmage Khadgar has a very urgent favor to ask. He is gravely concerned about additional threats this world may hold for Azeroth, and he will need your assistance pursuing them. Please see him at his tower, east of Talador, in the Zangarra swamp.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Delivery for Xi'lun <|obj|> While using the Blackrock Disguise, deliver the Clear Glass Orb to High Warlock Xi'lun atop Dreadmaul Rock in Burning Steppes.  <|text|> Intel tells us that High Warlock Xi'lun - the final member of the Big Three - is within the cave atop Dreadmaul Peak, preparing for his big moment. He is waiting for a delivery: an Orb of Domination, with which he can perform a powerful summoning ritual.  I want you to give him this: < Eitrigg hands you a glass orb. >This is the clear glass orb that you freed from the Altar of Storms.  It is powerless.  Give it to Xi'lun, and cross your fingers that he doesn't notice.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Lady of Light <|obj|> Speak to Lady Liadrin at the Burning Front in Talador.  <|text|> <name>, yes? You are the one in charge here? I am Knight-Lord Dranarus, at your service. Lady Liadrin has responded to a suspected demon presence near Auchindoun, southwest of here. She has asked specifically for your assistance in ensuring Auchindoun does not fall into Gul'dan's hands. If you could set forth at your nearest convenience, I am sure the Lady would be most grateful.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Rescue of Meredy Huntswell <|obj|> Rescue Meredy Huntswell from the harpy's necromantic ritual.  <|text|> Our expedition's mage, Meredy Huntswell, is being held by the harpies!

We've got to stop their ritual and rescue Meredy.

You lead the charge. Kee-La and I will back you up if things look dire.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Honor and Privilege <|obj|> Swim to the surface, retrieve the flare gun, and fire a rescue flare towards the Alliance Ships.  <|text|> All done! I'm confident it will work. And not a scrounger in sight to pop a hole in it this time! Fortuitous. Jorlan already swam up to catch it. Swam up and stopped to wait for it. He said you'd get the honors though. Jorlan's nice like that. Go to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Alliance ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it. Swim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Champion: Vanessa VanCleef <|obj|> After all that, you want me as your champion? &lt; Vanessa gives you a look of disbelief as she takes a moment before replying.  <|text|> After all that, you want me as your champion? <Vanessa gives you a look of disbelief as she takes a moment before replying. >Fine, but I do things my way. Agreed?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Not Just Any Body <|obj|> Find Loramus' Head, Loramus' Torso, and Loramus' Legs.  <|text|> Loramus Thalipedes is dead.  Well, let me step back. . . that's an assumption on my part, but I do know that his body lies in three pieces. <Lynnore ponders for a moment. >If you bring me the pieces, we still have a recourse.  All three pieces are nearby. . . the Dreadmaul ogres hide them in their caves.  In fact, one of them is in that chest, down the ledge behind me. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Spleendid!  <|obj|> Gnomus at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 8 Felfire Spleens.  <|text|> Have you ever heard of food that cooks itself and stays hot forever? Dare to dream, I say! But maybe it's not a dream at all! Outside the fortress, near the lava pools and streams, you can find beasts that thrive in the sizzling heat. They're called felfire diemetradons. The dwarves around here tell me that those diemetradons have the tastiest spleens ever and that the spleens practically come pre-cooked! Bring me those spleens and I'll give you some coin. Start your search directly east of here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fandral's Methods <|obj|> Obtain a Flame Druid Staff, a Flame Druid Spellbook, a Flame Druid Reagent Pouch, and a Flame Druid Idol.  <|text|> The Druids of the Flame. . . an order of druids that, up until a few weeks ago, Tholo and I had never even heard of. Now, under the leadership of Fandral Staghelm, they threaten our mission's success with their mastery of fire. It would appear that they store some supplies in the Igneous Depths, to the northeast. Perhaps, if we can get some of those supplies, we will have more luck when we take the fight to Fandral.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> WANTED: Sabertusk Empress <|obj|> Slay a Sabertusk Empress.  <|text|> To any and all brave enough to seek the challenge: Find and defeat a ferocious Sabertusk Empress, the strongest and most vicious of all sabertusks in Zuldazar. They can be found up and down the road from the Village in the Vines. A reward for any that succeed!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> WANTED: Dwarves!  <|obj|> You have been tasked with slaying opposing Dwarf players in Alterac Valley.  <|text|> By order of Sergeant Yazra Bloodsnarl, all dwarves on the field of battle are to be killed on sight. Should you slay a dwarf in combat, rip out their spine, leaving a spineless heap of stink and rot to serve as a warning to any and all that dare oppose the might of the Frostwolf. Return to Sergeant Yazra Bloodsnarl with proof of your heroics.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Have You Seen Anything Weird Out There?  <|obj|> Speak with Executor Zygand about your encounter with the worgen.  <|text|> <race>!  Listen up, I got somethin'. . . odd to discuss. I was out fishin' by Brightwater Lake when I saw the darnedest thing. . . some sorta wolf-man, running around Tirisfal.  Ya don't suppose that could be a. . . worgen, do ya? Anyway, I keep tellin' myself I should tell Executor Zygand about it, but I just get so scared when I talk to that guy.  Maybe you could talk with him?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Return to the Exodar <|obj|> Speak with Caedmos at the Exodar.  <|text|> Your master Caedmos of the Exodar has requested to see you.  It concerns your training, but I don't really know anything beyond that.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Duskwing, Oh How I Hate Thee. . .  <|obj|> Obtain a Patch of Duskwing's Fur.  <|text|> I have seen many things in my day, <race>.  The peaks of Mt. Hyjal. . . the oddities of Outland. . . a wall of Scourge soldiers, proceeding into war.  But I have never seen a bat as big, or as shockingly white, as Duskwing. How he taunts me from his roost! This albino demon bat circles to the southwest of here, due north of Blackwood Lake.  Track him down and destroy him.  If he flies too high for you to reach, use my flare to get his attention.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Supplies from The Archivists' Codex <|obj|> Speak with Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance in Korthia.  <|text|> I have no words to express the warmth that fills me knowing your dedication has ensured Korthia's history remain intact.

Please. Allow me to share my gratitude.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Light's Mercy <|obj|> Use the Confessor's Prayer Book to perform last rites for 8 Slain Tualiq Villagers and then return to Girana the Blooded at the Argent Tournament Grounds.  <|text|> I've been listening to Confessor Paletress speak, and I must tell you, her words have made me think. We fight beside the crusaders, but we can learn from them, too. Off the north coast is Hrothgar's Landing, where the seagoing Kvaldir have overrun an old tuskarr settlement and slain the villagers. Take this book and read the rites for the dead near the corpses of the villagers. It will allow their spirits to escape the mists engulfing the island and find peace.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Noggle's Lost Satchel <|obj|> Retrieve Noggle's Satchel from the mountains in the south of Silithus and return it to him at Cenarion Hold.  <|text|> Where am I?  Where's my bag? *gasp* I must've lost it while fleeing from Deathclasp, the giant scorpid.  In my rush to escape I walked right into a nest of stonelash flayers. The satchel I was carrying had all sorts of rare reagents in it.  Without them, me and Beetix won't be able to make the potions that Cenarion Hold needs.  I'm too weak to get up yet, but I can make it worth your while if you bring back my reagents. I ran into Deathclasp in the southern mountain range, behind Bronzebeard's camp.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Twisted Evils <|obj|> Collect 15 Theradric Crystal Carvings for Willow in Desolace.  <|text|> The crystal caverns of Terramok lie to the west, deep within Maraudon. . . It is an ancient place with much history. And I am looking to get my hands on some of it, <class>. Relics of the old gods lie hidden behind the giant doors. If you are willing to brave the twisted evils found in Maraudon, I believe I can make it worth your time. Collect the theradric crystal carvings you find, and return them to me. Once I get the carvings, I will be able to. . . study them. These powers have been too long at rest. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Talented <|obj|> Activate the Talents interface and allocate 5 Talent Points.  <|text|> Every <class> makes use of different abilities, talents and capabilities. We differ from each other in that we have unique interests and inclinations.

When you level up in power, you can enhance and specialize your abilities through your talents, without the instruction of a trainer.

If you change your mind on these talents, you can speak with a <class> trainer to rework them.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Remaining Sunreavers <|obj|> Use the Tear of the Sin'dorei on Uda the Beast, High Arcanist Savor, Magister Hathorel, Magister Surdiel, and Magistrix Vesara.  <|text|> There's still a number of significant Sunreavers who haven't been accounted for. Odds are that they're in the Sunreaver's Sanctuary, caught by surprise. <Rommath hands you an artifact, clearly made by blood elf hands. >The place is crawling with Silver Covenant. You'll need to get in, use the Tear to evacuate the VIPs, and then get out. Stay alive, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Black Morass <|obj|> Travel through the Caverns of Time to the Black Morass during the opening of the Dark Portal and speak with Sa'at.  <|text|> The Infinite Dragonflight have abandoned all pretense of subtlety. They plot to destroy the Guardian, Medivh, and prevent the Dark Portal from ever opening. While outwardly, this may appear a boon to the forces of the Alliance, it is in actuality catastrophic and will result in your world ending. You must venture through the timeway leading to the Black Morass. Go west and then south, past my future self, until you reach the tunnel that houses the swamp specimens. Cross over and speak with Sa'at.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Establish Your Garrison <|obj|> Build your garrison.  <|text|> I'm impressed with how quickly you have pulled this group together, commander. I think it's time we start putting up some walls and establishing a firm perimeter around our base.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Emerald Queen <|obj|> Speak to Malfurion when ready.  <|text|> <name>, you have returned. Good. I have counseled with the other archdruids and concluded that Cenarius' condition is merely a symptom of a much greater problem. Your experiences in Moonclaw Vale make that clear. We need help. There is one who can bring understanding to these events. With Thaon gone, we must ask that you aid us in reaching out to the Lady of Dreams.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Felbound Ancients <|obj|> Travel to Darnassus and use Eridan's Vial to collect a Vial of Blessed Water from the Temple of the Moon.  <|text|> The flute you found was carved from an ancient protector, the treant allies that have faithfully protected the night elves. The satyrs have been able to corrupt anything they come in contact with, which includes the ancients that made Felwood their home. By the use of the fel, the spirit of the ancient has been bound and tortured, never completely released. The felbind you found is no doubt related. We must try to purify the flute, <name>. Bring me blessed water from the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Proper Antivenom <|obj|> Obtain 14 samples of Glassweb Venom.  <|text|> Shame that Lunk left.  I was beginning to enjoy his company. Oh well, back to work! I'm the closest thing that this expedition has to a medical officer, and I'm running low on antivenom.  We tend to need a lot of antivenom. The key to a proper antivenom is ALWAYS to start with the poison itself.  The glassweb spiders nearby should be a good place to start.  If you kill them, you can probably extract some venom from the sacs within their jaws.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To the Valley!  <|obj|> Find your "Friend from Silvermoon" at the Valley of Emperors.  <|text|> This sealed communication was sent for you, along with urgent orders to travel to the Valley of Emperors in Kun-Lai Summit.

This looks serious. I'd not delay if I were you. Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Run Out the Guns <|obj|> Use a Northwatch Shore Battery to destroy 10 Rageroar Rowboats.  <|text|> We've got the hardware but not the manpower, <name>. Man one of the carronades on the shore here and take out those incoming boats!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Latent Power <|obj|> Charge the Shard of Gavrock at the First Ancient Stone, the Second Ancient Stone, and the Third Ancient Stone, then return to Gavrock at the Ruins of Tethys.  <|text|> While the runes of compulsion are dormant, there is a chance we can release the runed giants. I will give you a piece of stone that has been part of me since my creation. If properly imbued, it can be used to free the bound giants. Two ancient stone markers sit atop places of power between the Path of Iron and the forest's edge -- locations your people would call the intersections of ley lines. The other is on an island at the southern end of these ruins. Charge the shard at each stone and return.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Professions - Reuse <|obj|> Bring the memory back to the Runecarver.  <|text|> You've found what appears to be a memory of sorts. Perhaps it's another of the Runecarver 's stolen memories. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(62092)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Collecting Kelp <|obj|> Bring 4 Crystal Kelp Fronds to William Pestle in Goldshire.  <|text|> I can make an invisibility liquor for Maybell, so she can slip away from the Maclure Vineyards and go to Tommy Joe.  But to make the liquor, I need some crystal kelp. Although the kelp usually grows in the ocean. . . sometimes murlocs collect it.  See if the murlocs near Crystal Lake have any.  Crystal Lake is just east of Goldshire.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Battle for Alterac <|obj|> Enter Alterac Valley and defeat the dwarven general, Vanndar Stormpike.  <|text|> The Stormpike dwarves and their allies have invaded Alterac Valley, and we must drive them out!  To win the battle for Alterac, we must defeat their general, Vanndar Stormpike! You will find Vanndar in Dun Baldar, in the north of Alterac Valley. Destroy him, <name>, and then return to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Explosive Results <|obj|> Use the goblin explosives to free 500 Artifact Fragments from their geological prisons.  <|text|> As you may or may not have heard, I've been working with the goblins on using a new way of uncovering our artifacts. And if you know anything about goblins, you know that I'm talking about explosives. We've only run a few tests here at my camp, but I would appreciate your help in testing this method out in the field. I've marked a location on your map that has some particularly difficult digs.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Keg Run <|obj|> Deliver the Mountaineer's Ale to Forba Slabchisel at Slabchisel's Survey.  <|text|> Alright. We need to get this ale to where it's going right away! Ironforge has sent out an expedition of surveyors to check the damage done to the wetlands when the dam burst. Forba Slabchisel 's the one leading it. . . and believe me, you don't want to get on her bad side! Showing up with an armful of ale will help with that. Go and take this ahead to her, and she might even ask you to stick around for some work.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Note-Eating Goats <|obj|> Recover Addie's manuscript from Sated Hillstriders within Pinerock Basin.  <|text|> I've followed Hemet on all his expeditions from Stranglethorn to Nagrand to. . . Nagrand again, taking notes on his grand adventures and turning them into timeless literary tales.

But my heart is really in the hunt. I want nothing more than to put down the pen, and pick up a rifle!

Hemet promised to teach me how to hunt once I finish his latest novel, but the goats around here ate my first draft!

I have no hope of becoming a hunter if my manuscript isn't recovered.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Flashfrost Flyover <|obj|> Glide through the rings.  <|text|> Fly through the checkpoint rings marking the course. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(66710)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Some Water. . .  <|obj|> Nurse the plant back to health.  <|text|> <The plant is clear of soot and flame, but its leaves are limp with thirst. Perhaps someone from Central Encampment will know the perfect remedy. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Smoke Over the Mountain <|obj|> Find Pathfinder Yip's plane.  <|text|> < Pathfinder Jeb looks at the mountain ridge beyond the camp and sniffs. >

I don't like it. Pathfinder Yips should've been here days ago. Was gonna help me teach this new batch of explorers how to climb these pillars safely.

Now I see smoke in the distance.

I don't like it at all.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> We Must Construct Additional Pylons <|obj|> Collect 6 Arkonite Crystals and an Arkonite Pylon from the Tomb of Lights.  <|text|> We came here to retrieve a reserve pylon to power Auchindoun's defenses, but we've been pinned to this position by the Shadow Council for hours! I need to get these injured back to Exarch's Refuge, but we still need the backup system! Please, gather Arkonite crystals and an Arkonite pylon from the tomb and meet me at the refuge as quickly as you can!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Iverron's Antidote <|obj|> Collect 7 Hyacinth Mushrooms, 4 Moonpetal Lilies, and 1 Webwood Ichor for Dirania Silveshine in Shadowglen.  <|text|> We may be able to help Iverron, as I know of an antidote that should help with the poison. It requires some ingredients, though, before I can make it. I'll need Hyacinth mushrooms. You can find these growing under trees, or you may collect them from the grell south of here; they seem to have taken a liking to them. I'll also need Moonpetal lilies, which only grow around watery pools. The last ingredient may prove the most difficult. From the very spiders that poisoned Iverron, collect Webwood ichor.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Armed and Ready <|obj|> Choose a weapon for Nisha.  <|text|> You must be special if the sethrak didn't kill you right away.
 
Either that, or you'd fetch a good price at the slave market.

Don't worry though. We're getting out of here.

I have a wagon at the entrance, but no weapon to fight with.
 
Luckily, it seems the sethrak have plenty.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Grisly Grizzlies <|obj|> Obtain 5 Plagued Bruin Hides.  <|text|> Have you seen the plagued bruins that wander to the west of here?  Those hides. . . so hideous, so diseased, so. . . perfect! Fetch me 5 of them.  I've got an idea for an anti-Scourge poison that's guaranteed to succeed!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rare Resources <|obj|> Collect 3 Coins of Brokerage from rare monsters and treasure chests in the Shadowlands.  <|text|> Kh-kh-kh. . . the brokers, they go to many places. Many places we cannot. The eyes cannot follow them.

Find many secrets, they do. Bring us supplies, strange and rare.

Need things to trade. Need broker coins.

They trade with all. Find coins in all lands. Slay those that hold them, bring the coins to me. 

You may eat their corpses, I will not judge. Just need coins.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Captain Sander's Hidden Treasure <|obj|> Locate Captain Sanders' chest and open it for your reward.  <|text|> Sure enough, deep within the Old Jug there is another clue to Sander's treasure.  The ink has run in some places and the paper smells like whiskey but you can make out some of the text:  Now that ye found me ol' whiskey jug, you're almost to the treasure!  Just face West from the bottle and walk down to the shore.  Once ye get to the water, keep going!  Swim straight west till you find the island with me treasure chest!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Capture a Mine <|obj|> Capture a mine, then return to Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl in Frostwolf Village.  <|text|> As battle rages over the landscape of Alterac Valley, so too does it rage through the Coldtooth and Irondeep mines.  Both are rich sources of minerals and both are used to store supplies; it's no wonder they are so highly valued! Help our war effort, <name>!  Capture one of the mines for the Horde!  To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.  When that is done, the mine will be ours and we'll send troops to protect it!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Parts for Kravel <|obj|> Bring Kravel's Parts to Kravel Koalbeard in the Shimmering Flats.  <|text|> Here's Kravel's package, <name>.  And when you deliver it, tell him. . . if he wants more special orders, then he'll have to pay his tab!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To Netherwing Ledge!  <|obj|> Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to collect 12 Nethervine Crystals from Netherwing Ledge.  <|text|> I believe that I can imbue nethervine crystals with my own essence. The power contained within these imbued crystals should be sufficient to free enslaved drakes of their masters' grasps. Travel to Netherwing Ledge, an island located off the broken shelf of Shadowmoon Valley, to the southeast. It is on Netherwing Ledge that you will find nethervine crystals. Return to me when you have collected enough crystals to fill your packs. And <name>, Beware the Dragonmaw that now inhabit the island.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sampling the Goods <|obj|> Collect the Chemist's Notes and a Raw Azerite Sample.  <|text|> Bridgeport is a major trade hub for this area. Naturally, Ashvane has offices and workshops here.

Check around town and see if you can learn anything about this new material and how they're using it.

If you can lift a sample for us to send back to Boralus, even better.

I gotta stay here and keep an eye on someone.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Tower of Althalaxx <|obj|> Collect a Glowing Soul Gem and return it to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post.  <|text|> Balthule's letter is dire. This Cult of the Dark Strand is a thorn in my side that must be removed. I have been dealing with some of the Dark Strand scum northeast of here at Ordil'Aran. One of their number possesses a soul gem that I believe holds the secret to the cult's power. Bring it to me, and I will be able to decipher the secrets held within.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Summoning Shadra <|obj|> Use the Idol of Shadra at the Northwestern, Southwestern, and Eastern Temples in Shadra'Alor.  <|text|> The idol is prepared, <name>. I trust that you are as well? You will go southwest to Shadra'Alor ahead of us with the idol. You'll need to use the idol at each of the three temples. When you do that, Shadra will be summoned to this realm. The Deathstalkers and I will be along shortly to subdue and harvest her body. Speak with the lookout I've sent ahead once you've performed the ritual, and await my arrival.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Inoculation <|obj|> Use the Inoculating Crystal on 6 Nestlewood Owlkin.  <|text|> Zhanaa needs our help to salvage parts from the Exodar.  Taerix prepared an inoculum that can be given to the Nestlewood owlkin that live in the area of a lot of the salvage. Just get close to the unaffected ones and use the crystal on them.  Unfortunately, you'll have to kill the others.  You'll find the owlkin at Nestlewood Thicket and Nestlewood Hills to the southeast.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mystery Goo <|obj|> Report back to Donova Snowden with your findings.  <|text|> The greenish substance inside the cauldron appears to be similar to what you found in the flask.

But if you can find an unhatched egg, then delivering specimens will be much easier, and I can then arrange for the unhatched spiders to be contained. There must be a nest deep in the Shadowthread Cave.  Please, search for an egg in the nest and return it to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mulgore Spice Bread <|obj|> Use Mulgore Spices with Spice Bread to create 5 Fresh Mulgore Spice Bread (you may make your own Spice Bread or use someone else's).  <|text|> I am often asked, "Aska, who is making all this Mulgore spice bread? ! "It is a reasonable question. Our fine and noble bread is traded in countless settlements in the most far-away lands, even by our staunchest foes. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD. And the answer. . . ? It is "YOU. " Please take this packet of Mulgore spices and use it to turn bland, boring spice bread into MULGORE spice bread!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Brotherly Love <|obj|> Travel into Frostwolf territory and slay Commander Louis Philips.  <|text|> He must be put out of his misery, soldier! He knows not what he does. He has become a mindless servant of the dreaded Banshee Queen. Venture forth, across the Field of Strife, to the depths of Frostwolf territory. Find my brother and destroy him. His torment must come to an end.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dropping Bombs <|obj|> Call artillery strikes on the Gordunni Boulderthrower encampments within Gordal Fortress.  <|text|> The Gordunni have only a single path to their fortress and it is well-defended from a large attack. Thankfully they wont be expecting just the two of us to be attempting to break in. This is a great opportunity to take out their defenses and get some target practice for our gunners back at the artillery tower. Take these smoke grenades and use it to call in an artillery strike on their catapults as we head up.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Battlefield Triage <|obj|> Collect 5 Vacant Elemental Cores and 1 Zaqali Flame Totem.  <|text|> Our situation is less than ideal, we will have to improvise. I can conduct flame to earth to create magma. Shadowflame could behave similarly.

The Primalists are summoning earth elementals nearby. If we extract their cores, I can use them to contain the shadowflame infecting Sabellian's burn.

The Zaqali's totems should already be attuned to the elements here. It will make the siphoning process much more efficient.

Sabellian will need to come with us. I must keep an eye on him--for his sake.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Storm, Earth, and Fire <|obj|> Destroy 5 Fel Spikes, put out 5 Fel Fires, and destroy 5 Tainted Ale barrels.  <|text|> Tian Monastery is in bad shape. Felspreader imps are torching the grounds. Fel spikes radiate foul energy, corrupting the nearby earth. And fel magic has seeped into the monastery's ale barrels, tainting the brew. Use your abilities to snuff the flames, shatter the spikes, and destroy the tainted barrels. Sigh. . . hundreds of years of the finest ale. . . ruined. I don't wish to hear any more of it. Just get it done.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Baron Aquanis <|obj|> Bring the Strange Water Globe to Davidus Voidstar in Auberdine, Darkshore.  <|text|> Greetings <class>. I've heard the most curious stories from the locals of a great corrupted water elemental named Baron Aquanis that stands vigil near the entrance to the Night Elf ruins known as Blackfathom Deeps. I'm here looking to hire adventurers brave enough to retrieve the core of Baron Aquanis, a globe of corrupted water. In exchange, I'd be willing to give you access to a portal directly to the Zoram Strand that I've been using to study the environs around the ruins. . . from a safe distance, of course.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Good Friend <|obj|> Find Iverron by the cave to the north.  <|text|> A friend of mine named Iverron usually visits me at the same time every day. The strange thing is that he hasn't been by today at all -- he's several hours late, in fact. I admit, I am a little worried, <name>. Iverron spends a lot of time over by the cave to the north, and I'm sure you know how dangerous it is there -- spiders, everywhere! If you happen to be going that way, though, will you keep an eye out for him?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Righteous Indignation <|obj|> Obtain 30 Mossflayer Eyes from Mossflayer trolls in Zul'Mashar.  <|text|> The Mossflayers of Zul'Mashar spit in the face of the Light!  They cannibalize, they criminalize, they prioritize the forces of evil over good!  I advise that you remove their eyes, and give rise to the demise and the goodbyes of the unwise! You will travel north, and you will rain down on them with righteous justice and indignation, <name>.  The fury that they have wrought in the eyes of the Light shall be channeled through you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Peering Into the Past <|obj|> Speak to Lorewalker Cho at the Circle of Stone.  <|text|> Just a moment, now. Allow me to gather my things. Wouldn't want me to lose these notes now, would we? Especially after you risked life and limb for them! There, all set. Let us be off, shall we? I must say, I feel much safer traveling with you after seeing how you handled that saurok!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> It's Raid Night Every Night <|obj|> Help Sergeant Flinthammer and his mountaineers defend Amberstill Ranch from Frostmane Raiders.  <|text|> The reports I'm sending Captain Tharran can't really convey the amount of trouble the Frostmanes have created for us. Your assault on the village has started to relieve some of the pressure. The raids are still frequent, but the trolls don't have the numbers they once did. Even so, my men are tired and their morale is flagging. Would you help us keep watch for the Frostmane raiders? They could turn up at any time.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tol'vir Hieroglyphics <|obj|> This gravestone marks a strange burial site - possibly from one of the original builders.  <|text|> Using the keystone, you confirm the grave is from one of the original builders, and you learn important details of the mummification process.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Jailer's Grasp <|obj|> Help Jaina Proudmoore sever the Jailer's connection to Bolvar.  <|text|> By peering into the Maw, Bolvar drew the Jailer's attention.

His worst fears have come to pass.

You must help me break the link, <name>! The fragment of the Helm is the key!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Don't Close Your Eyes <|obj|> Wake Thessera, Verdisa and Karkarius from Void dreams.  <|text|> The Void assaults us as we sleep! Those who it ensnares may never wake again.

They can only be roused by powerful magic native to our dragonflight. The shards that have formed near our fallen kin may be exactly what is needed.

If we succumb to slumber in the Void, we will be lost forever. Please, aid us!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Hero Is Needed <|obj|> Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to slay 12 Auchenai Initiates and 5 Auchenai Doomsayers.  <|text|> It is not enough. A hero is needed. Our forces are overwhelmed as the Auchenai continue to grow in number. < Commander Ra'vaj looks at you. >Will you be the hero? Return to the field of battle and strike at their soldiers. Keep them occupied so that my scouts can get behind their lines and see what they are creating.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hazzard Disposal <|obj|> Use Kitty's Eartag to get Winna Hazzard's attention, and then slay her.  <|text|> Winna's hooked tight into the source of the slime itself, at the very back of Bloodvenom Post to the west. She makes sure it keeps flowing, and it keeps her safe! But if you can get her attention. . . Take the eartag and show it to Winna. If there's even a little, tiny bit of her left, maybe it'll get through. Maybe her regret for her poor lost kitty will come to the surface and she'll feel sorry just one more time, and come out of the slime! And then maybe you can kill her and stop the slime. Yay!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Great Egg Hunt <|obj|> The Spring Collector wants you to get 20 shell fragments.  <|text|> Noblegarden, celebration of life and spring! I hope you've been enjoying the egg hunt, friend, because I could use the services of a capable individual like you. I'm not certain what form of magic was used in the creation of the eggs, and the druids aren't keen on explaining it to me. Perhaps you could collect some shell fragments for me during your egg collection. You can keep the contents of the eggs; all I require is a sufficient sample of the eggs themselves.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tol Dagor: The Fourth Key <|obj|> Enter the Tol Dagor dungeon, recover the Ashvane Skeleton Key and kill Overseer Korgus, then return to Flynn Fairwind in the Harbormaster's Office in Boralus.  <|text|> Hey, wait a second. I know the type of key our fourth lock needs. This is the same sort of lock the Ashvane company uses. Resists lockpicks like nothing else, but they have a standard skeleton key. There was a set hanging on the wall in the Tol Dagor Armory. Given the state we left it in, it'd be easy to grab it.

Taelia and I will take the chest back to the Harbormaster's office for safe keeping. 

You go in to Tol Dagor and get that last key!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hidden Motives <|obj|> Locate the naga invasion plans.  <|text|> I do not understand why the naga would bother attacking a small fishing village.

Why waste their time on our simple tribe? The naga seek power and we have none. It makes no sense!

They must be after something else entirely. . .

Search Darkwood Shoal and learn of their plans. Whatever the naga are after, it must be quite powerful.

Perhaps if we find it first, we can use it against them!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The "Unwelcome" Guests <|obj|> Eliminate 3 nathrezim inside Sinfall.  <|text|> Chelra, I mean Nal'ragas, would not have been working alone. We must assume the worst, that not all of our friends and allies are who they seem to be.

It will take time for the Court of Harvesters to render our detection ritual. While we do so we will be exposed. I ask that you use the techniques you employed at Dominance Gate within Sinfall to root out any nathrezim within our ranks. 

Good hunting.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Spawn Tracking Unit-Specified World Effect in a WMO Bug <|obj|> Attempt to figure out why the WMO spawned objective's minimap golden dot will not appear when its spawn tracking is set to Unit instead of Objective.  <|text|> There seems to be a bug when you setup a world effect containing a gold dot on the minimap through Spawn Tracking that is set to Unit, rather than Objective. It seems to only happen with spawns inside WMOs. Might also be happening with setting it to Object as well.

If the Spawn Tracking on the World Effect is set to Objective, everything's fine. However, if it is set to Unit, the golden dot will not show up on the minimap. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(60474)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Primal Pests <|obj|> Kill 10 Primal Proto-drakes on the Wild Coast.  <|text|> <Cindrethresh glances suspiciously at the proto-dragons lurking on the ridge behind her. >

I'd swear that those proto-dragons edge closer to camp every time I turn my back. . .

Those are not the dragons Ebyssian invited us here to meet.

Proto-dragons are ruthless predators who cannot be reasoned with. We must be ruthless in return.

Cull their numbers to keep their ambitions in check, or this expedition will be over before it begins.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Urok Doomhowl <|obj|> Read Warosh's Scroll.  <|text|> Argh!  So hard to speak! Take this note!  Get me my mojo!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Battle-Mage Dathric <|obj|> Locate Battle-Mage Dathric's quarters in Wizard's Row and return the blade to his weapon rack.  <|text|> The sword is of exceptional quality, finely crafted and perfectly balanced for a battle-mage. The seal of the Kirin Tor and the name "Dathric" are engraved into the weapon's pommel. Turning the weapon over in your hands, you notice a sense of wrongness radiating from the metal, as if the item is torn between two worlds. Could this be the item anchoring Battle-Mage Dathric's spirit to this world? Perhaps returning it to its proper place can break the bond, freeing Dathric's spirit to rest at last.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Champion: Huntsman Blake <|obj|> You brought a tear to this old man's eye by bringing Baron back to life.  <|text|> You brought a tear to this old man's eye by bringing Baron back to life. I never thought I'd miss his ear-piercing howls, but I did. It's a wonderful thing to see him working again. We're happy to help wherever we're needed.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Scarlet Armies Approach. . .  <|obj|> Deliver The Path of Redemption to Highlord Darion Mograine at Acherus: The Ebon Hold.  <|text|> We must prepare for the encroaching armies, <name>. You will take what you have discovered to Highlord Mograine at once! I will open a portal directly to Acherus. Step inside and it will transport you. Give Highlord Mograine Abbendis' journal as well. Perhaps he'll find it useful.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Keys to Success in Freehold <|obj|> Collect the keys from Irontide Lieutenants.  <|text|> I've been known to be a betting man, and I'd place good odds on the information we need being in Harlan Sweete's Strongbox. This would be far too valuable to put anywhere else. I bet they haven't even moved the chest. The problem is the security features.

See, the chest is locked by three keys and he gave each one to a different lieutenant. We'll need to get those.

But between your skills, my finesse and Taelia's air support this will be easy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mercy for the Living <|obj|> Kill 6 Fungus Covered Shamblers.  <|text|> You can see that the dead were the lucky ones. Those that live wander about attacking anything not infected with these vile spores. I cannot bring myself to slay them, but if you could bring mercy to those poor people I would be very grateful.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Catch the Wild Wolpertinger!  <|obj|> Sniperhunter Goro has asked you to capture 5 Stunned Wolpertingers using the Wolpertinger Net.  <|text|> On Draenor, many creatures posed a tough hunt. However, I've never encountered a creature such as the wild wolpertinger of Azeroth!

These beasts are not to be found most of the year, but the sounds and smells of Brewfest seem to draw them out. If you look around, you still may not see them. . . which is where these goggles come in handy!

Prove to me you are a worthy hunter and bring me five of these wolpertingers alive. If you need some goggles, I have some to spare.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Looking for Something Specific <|obj|> Return to Shaw in the basement of the Lion's Pride Inn.  <|text|> < Ragged John blinks blearily up at you. > 

So ye took down that ol' worg, didye? Well aren't ye the biggest strongest human I seen since ol' Windsor.

<|startoftext|> A Deadly Vine <|obj|> Collect 5 pieces of Corpseweed.  <|text|> I need large amounts of corpseweed for Master Harris's concoctions. It's difficult to obtain, but we can't let our supply dwindle. corpseweed is tough stuff to tangle with. . . the plant will get you before you get it, if you're not careful! But if you'd like to help out, I'll eagerly pay you for any you gather yourself. You'll find plenty of it all over the Yorgen Stead to the southeast.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Plaguewood Tower <|obj|> Bring Highbeacon's Parcel to Argent Apothecary Judkins at Plaguewood Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.  <|text|> With the recent, unfortunate developments involving Gidwin, it might not be wise for a man my age to take the dangerous trip through the Plaguewood.  This is fine - I can visit the Plaguewood Tower on my next trip around the loop. I do, however, have a delivery that I need to get to Judkins.  You are younger than I, and stronger in combat.  Will you take this delivery to him?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Saving the Best for Last <|obj|> Give Deliana your Wildheart Cowl and Wildheart Vest.  <|text|> That's an amazing story, <name>! You have my thanks, and the heartfelt gratitude of all who were involved. Now maybe I'll be able to sleep at night with both eyes shut. As to your reward, I believe I have a few things that you'll really enjoy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bubbling Brews <|obj|> Collect brew bubbles in Valdrakken.  <|text|> Drat! I might've made a mistake asking the dracthyr to help with these deliveries. They've been rolling barrels of brews through the city and crashing 'em all over the place! Well, we shouldn't let the brew go to waste if we can help it!

Take a barrel an' take to the skies! Try to collect and save as much of the brew as you can by collecting the bubbles.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Taerar's Fall <|obj|> Defeat Taerar.  <|text|> Emeriss and Lethon are gone. It's only us left now. I can hide from this no longer. All I did while a part of that brood. . . all the suffering I've caused. . . must be repaid today. I am still weak, <name>. I cannot assume my true form even if I dare try. But I will still stand beside you in battle. If you are prepared, I will call Taerar to us. He will be unable to resist the temptation of revisiting corruption upon me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Part of the Pack <|obj|> Speak to Apprentice Fess at the crossroads west of Darkshire in Duskwood.  <|text|> I've been trying to keep my true self hidden away from the people of Darkshire. . . they seem to react poorly to worgen. There are more of us here, though, beyond the city. The companions I first traveled here with search the woods for wild worgen. They believe some of them, ones with telltale signs, can still be returned to sanity. I'm not quite ready to rejoin them. Please send word to Apprentice Fess at the crossroads west of town that I'll be staying in Darkshire a while longer.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Four Heads are Better than None <|obj|> Collect the four heads of Za'brox and Beeble'phod.  <|text|> We're about to launch the attack upon the Twilight Gate, but there is one last loose end to tie up: Za'brox and Beeble'phod, the disciples of Cho'gall. Intelligence has placed them within the Den of the Disciples, a small ogre cave at the southwest corner of the Twilight Gate. Would you go back in there and kill them?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Crypt Keeper <|obj|> Collect Valentine's Key from Brutus Thornton.  <|text|> I've been keeping my sights on the cemetery.

There is one ghost that walks with a purpose, unlike the others.

He is the crypt keeper, the keeper of the keys.

If we want to get to Valentine's body, we will need to go through the ghost first.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Gordok Ogre Suit <|obj|> Need another suit, do ya? &nbsp; Well, I'm not going anywhere soon it seems - bring me the same things I asked for from before, and I'll make you another ogre suit.  <|text|> Here ya go <name> - put this thing on, and you'll have ten minutes to do whatever.  Good luck! Oh, and if you happen to find a key to get me out of here, BY ALL MEANS LET ME KNOW! ! !  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Going Off-Task <|obj|> Kill the Southsea Taskmaster.  <|text|> As you may have seen, the ship docked to the north has its cannons blazing. While it's pretty fun watching the gnomes run face-first into a hail of iron, my bruisers keep doing it too, and it's absolutely killing my overhead expenses. I'd like you to try and dance through the cannonfire, get on that ship, and kill the taskmaster leading the cannoneers. The rest of the crew is probably a bunch of spineless prats; once he's down, we should be good.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Blueleaf Tubers <|obj|> Grab a Crate with Holes.  <|text|> Blueleaf tubers are a delicacy around the world!  But they're rare, very rare.  The only place to find them is here in the Barrens, deep in the earth, in Razorfen Kraul. And even then, they're impossible to find unless you know just where to look!  That's why I've trained these snufflenose gophers to find them for me.  They have great noses and can smell a tuber from fifty paces away. It won't be easy, but if you get me some tubers I'll pay you handsomely.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Triage <|obj|> Save patients by using Triage Bandages to tend to their wounds.  <|text|> Good day, doctor. You will be tested on your ability to triage patients accordingly this afternoon. Should you pass your examination, you will join the prestigious ranks of Alliance Trauma. Now pay attention! The critically injured must be tended to first. After the criticals come the badly injured. The injured should be tended to last. You must save 15 patients to pass this exam. You will fail should 6 of your patients die in triage. Good luck, doctor.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Beastmaster's Quarry: The Crab <|obj|> Bring the Colossal Viseclaw to Huntsman Blake.  <|text|> The colossal crab is alive, but stunned. You should bring it back to Huntsman Blake before it wakes up.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Behind Closed Doors <|obj|> Kill Galgann Firehammer.  <|text|> Galgann Firehammer and his band of Dark Irons are in Dig Three guarding a door that we know nothing about!  I've had it with their men getting in the way of our work here! The Reliquary is the only group authorized to handle the artifacts throughout Uldaman! Go to the dig and dispose of him so that our work can continue undisturbed. I want to know what's behind that door!  <|endoftext|>

Even their captain - especially their captain - must die. I will be in contact.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Threat from the North <|obj|> Find Malfurion Stormrage in Lor'danel.  <|text|> The Horde must have scaled the mountains of Felwood in the North. 

The wisp wall is failing, it is only a matter of time before the Horde breaks through. They will attack us from both sides. 

We must weather this attack together.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Shattered Hand <|obj|> Speak with Thega Graveblade at The Barracks in Orgrimmar.  <|text|> A messenger just arrived from Orgrimmar bearing a communication for you.

<|startoftext|> A Charming Deception <|obj|> Use 5 Illusion Charms to draw out Adherent Harriers.  <|text|> Reshad is more than he appears; a mottled old crow with his beak in a book, certainly, but we need him. Shadows gather beneath the lonely spire, in Veil Terokk. Reshad must make it there safely. Along the path you'll find charms primed with illusion spells. You need only touch them to take on Reshad 's image. Adherent assassins are on the prowl for an old outcast with scrolls on his back. They will fall upon you. Oh, but won't they be surprised when the illusion fades? ! Kee-hee-hee!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bones - Rank 1 Unlock <|obj|> Find someone on Argus who might be able to train you on how to handle Astral Glory.  <|text|> Amazed that anything so pure could continue to grow on this planet, you pick flower from the ground. You feel a small power radiate from it and then vanish. As it falls apart in your hands, you wonder if anyone on this Light-forsaken place knows how to handle this precious herb. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(49457)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Tide Turns <|obj|> Assault the naga camp and seize control of the Tidestone of Golganneth.  <|text|> The time to strike is now. We must take the Tidestone of Golganneth and the Javelin of Suramar is our best chance of piercing the barrier around it. Every minute we wait is another minute when the sea can come crashing down on us. What forces we have will be arrayed below, just outside their encampment. We will need your strength in addition to the Javelin, <name>. We do not have enough forces to take it on our own.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Redemption Legguards <|obj|> Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make a pair of Redemption Legguards if you bring him the following: 1 Desecrated Legguards, 20 Wartorn Plate Scraps, 4 Arcanite Bars and 2 Nexus Crystals.  <|text|> You will find the remnants of our fallen heroes on the corpses of the Lords of Naxxramas. Bring those desecrated keepsakes to me along with wartorn plate scraps and crafting materials capable of revitalizing the cursed armor and I shall craft a fine piece of armor for you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dire Growth <|obj|> Meet with Naralex, plant the Lasher Seed, and analyze its effects.  <|text|> Naralex asks for you to join him. He is ready to analyze the sample that he brought back from Shaladrassil.  <|endoftext|>

She now believes that she has discovered its location and requires your assistance in its recovery. Find Allari at Illidari Stand in Azsuna and aid her in any way possible. If Sargeras truly plans to use Illidan's body as a vessel for his own return then returning Illidan's soul to his body is integral in preventing the dark titan from returning to our world!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> War Supplies <|obj|> Destroy 12 Shatterspear Armaments.  <|text|> The trolls are building their forces and supplies at the war camp to the north. When they feel they are ready, they will almost certainly launch their attack on Lor'danel from that location. It shouldn't take us long to rout this rabble, but I'm not one for taking unnecessary risks. I want you to fight your way into the war camp and set fire to any stockpiles of supplies that you see. The setback should buy us quite a bit of time before they can muster a counterattack.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Defenders of Daelin's Gate <|obj|> Ride with Taelia to Vigil Hill.  <|text|> Daelin's Gate has protected the southern channel for decades. If it falls, the pirate fleet can sail straight into Tiragarde Sound!

<|startoftext|> Dirgemire <|obj|> Retrieve the Fungal Brain from Dirgemire.  <|text|> In order to fully understand the nature and properties of the Zangarium Draenormycota, I need to examine the strain within a complex fungal structure.

In a cavern deep below the surface is an ancient spore giant the locals fearfully refer to as Dirgemire. Slay the monster, but be sure to carefully preserve the fungal brain for our research!  <|endoftext|>

The Shado-Pan will surely want to examine it. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Sentinel's Pawn <|obj|> Find a use for the Sentinel's Pawn within the Tomb of the Watchers in the Badlands.  <|text|> We found this small red statue on the corpse of one of those Explorers' League archaeologists.

It seems that dragons tormented her people and after her village temple was destroyed, she rallied the local tribes, became a queen and killed all of the dragons. She was then banished for some reason and wandered until her death, alone. What proves the story is a piece of draconic slag from left over from a metal idol in her birth village.

Only problem is, the Gates of Valor are swarming with the biggest, baddest, nastiest Legion creatures I've ever seen. If we walk in there, we'll just get slaughtered.

Let's steal some of that drink, then storm in to save Hiro!  <|endoftext|>

The cut of the gems looks like a primitive or simple version of the way you've learned to cut rubellites.

Repairing this shrine may be as simple as replacing the old gems with newer ones of the same type and cut. > <|endoftext|>

She is the one who originally helped our people with their affliction.

Vassandra is currently in Duskwood, assisting the residents of Raven Hill with their attempts to cure the feral worgen in the area. If anyone knows about the curse, it is her.

As a more personal request, do not let my daughter do anything too rash. She takes after her father in that way.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Brew For Brewfest <|obj|> You have 4 minutes to ride the ram and maintain 3 different levels of speed for 8 seconds.  <|text|> So you want to check out the racing rams?  The dwarves think they have got a handle on it, but let's be honest, they are drunk most of the time, so how hard can it really be?

<|startoftext|> Border Issues <|obj|> Convince the House Stormsong militia to clear the blockade.  <|text|> They've closed off the entire valley! No wonder so many people have been complaining about trading with the Brennadam market.

Defeat any opponents that stand in your way. Ensure the relics cannot be used against the Alliance.

The naga cannot be allowed to summon their storm. . . or to call forth something even worse.  <|endoftext|>

Our stores are nearly depleted, and we have little to trade, but our needs are great.

Let us reflect. 

In Bastion, there are those that have turned their backs on their own people.

We may relieve these deceivers of their gildenite without remorse.  <|endoftext|>

Finally, I need fur from the bears along the water to the northeast. Wait until they catch a fish, then get the sample quickly and get away before they finish eating. Please do not harm any of them.  <|endoftext|>

But before I. . . d-d-die. . . . . . my wife, Treshala. . . her pendant of bonding to me. . . stolen. . . by one of the f-f-foul aggressors. . .

<|startoftext|> Lightforge Ingots <|obj|> Gather 5 lightforge ingots, then return to Glorin Steelbrow in the Wetlands.  <|text|> You might have found one lightforge ingot in that chest, but that's not enough to craft anything decent! You should go back there and look for more.  Maybe the murlocs around that wrecked ship have lightforge ingots on them.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Delivery for Xi'lun <|obj|> While using the Blackrock Disguise, deliver the Clear Glass Orb to High Warlock Xi'lun atop Dreadmaul Rock in Burning Steppes.  <|text|> Intel tells us that High Warlock Xi'lun - the final member of the Big Three - is within the cave atop Dreadmaul Peak, preparing for his big moment. He is waiting for a delivery: an Orb of Domination, with which he can perform a powerful summoning ritual.  I want you to give him this: <Troteman hands you a glass orb. >This is the clear glass orb that you freed from the Altar of Storms.  It is powerless.  Give it to Xi'lun, and cross your fingers that he doesn't notice.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Trial of Style <|obj|> Speak to a Transmogrifier to enter and complete the Trial of Style.  <|text|> Well, that's certainly an. . . interesting look, <class>.

Me? Judgmental? Certainly not. However, I'm curious what others would think of it.

You should speak to the Transmogrifier over there and enter the Trial of Style.

We'll see what public opinion says about your choice in garb.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Floodsurge Core <|obj|> Deliver the Floodsurge Core to Forba Slabchisel.  <|text|> This is all that's left of the huge elemental that attacked you: a frothing orb of water that continues to fight your grip. Forba might appreciate seeing proof that you helped stop another threat to the camp.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Innovating the Engine <|obj|> Insert the newly attuned Power Core into the Engine of Innovation.  <|text|> Tyr believed that the Engine of Innovation would be necessary for the battles to come.

<|startoftext|> Sage's Oath <|obj|> Bring your Band of Eternity to Soridormi at the Caverns of Time after obtaining Revered reputation with the Scale of the Sands.  <|text|> You've carried out the promise you made to us, <name>.

It won't be long until it has reached its full potential.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To Track a Demon <|obj|> Collect 3 Impsorrow Missives from demons in Impsorrow Approach.  <|text|> I took the initiative to scout around before I grabbed that wyrmtongue. It seems like their forces are holed up in a camp in Impsorrow Approach. What I've struggled to figure out, however, is who their commander is and if he's nearby. If he's leading from elsewhere, the troops need to have some commands on them. Let's go see if we can find any. . . on their dead bodies!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Return Fire <|obj|> Use an Astranaar Thrower to shoot down 15 Hellscream's Hellions & their Watch Wind Riders.  <|text|> The fires are mostly contained, but we have to do something about those wind riders!

<|startoftext|> Pristine Game Board <|obj|> Put the artifact on display.  <|text|> This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the Seat of Knowledge, so that lorewalkers and archaeologists can study it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Buzzbox 827 <|obj|> Collect 6 Crawler Legs and place them in Buzzbox 827.  <|text|> Hey! Help me with my latest invention, the buzzbox. You can talk to people far away! Maybe you've already seen them, they're boxes with levers on them. The only problem is they need constant maintenance. Each one suffers from a different problem, but I made a really smart decision. I placed each one near creatures that have the proper parts to fix that particular machine. Right now Buzzbox 827 is on the fritz. It's just south of Auberdine, real close. It takes 6 Crawler Legs to fix it. I'll pay ya. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Breaking Waves of Change <|obj|> Use the teleportation tree in western Darnassus to reach Rut'theran Village, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a ride to Lor'danel.  <|text|> You! You look able. And perhaps willing to help? Auberdine has finally fallen. Though many of its inhabitants departed long ago when the city first suffered the brunt of the Cataclysm, many of the more stubborn residents are yet unaccounted for. And it now appears that the city may have been overrun by water elementals. My sisters need help rescuing the survivors. Please, <class>, use the western tree to reach Rut'theran, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a flight to Lor'danel. Be swift!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Fall of Corlain <|obj|> Examine 6 Corlain Citizen's Journals in Upper Corlain.  <|text|> <This discarded journal looks like it belonged to one of the residents of upper Corlain. Within it details some early signs of the Heartsbane's appearance in Corlain.

If you can find more writings like this, you might be able to piece together the events that led to Corlain's current state. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> An Unnatural Drought <|obj|> Vindicator Idaar at Telredor wants you to kill 12 Withered Giants.  <|text|> The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, <name>. If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the Dead Mire must be suffering terribly. I've seen what happens when the region's fungal giants begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path. These creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Eternal Palace: We Can Make It Stronger. . .  <|obj|> Collect 20 Eternal Ornaments from the most powerful creatures of the Eternal Palace.  <|text|> Now that it's functioning, it occurred to me while repairing it that it has the capability to output even more energy. Of course that will require stronger materials to upgrade and the only place I can think of is in the Eternal Palace. Azshara's army and even herself carry items of extraordinary power. If you could bring some of those back, I could at the very least test my theory and see if it's viable.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Shipwrecked Survivors <|obj|> Speak with First Sergeant Steelfang.  <|text|> It appears that we have allies here on the Broken Shore. A small band of shipwrecked soldiers have been surviving here since the first assault. Their strength and tenacity will bolster our ranks. Make your way to their encampment along the beach and bring them here. Tell them that reinforcements have arrived, and the battle against the Burning Legion waits for no one.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Shred the Alliance <|obj|> Grekk at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to acquire 3 shredders and return to him with them.  <|text|> Read my lips, <class> - I need those shredders! Just as important - I need to keep them out of the hands of the Alliance! They've been refurbishing the shredders and using them against our brothers in Venture Bay. Now we're going to give them a taste of their own medicine! You see a shredder out there, grab it! You see one of the Alliance scum on one, kill 'em and then grab it! Once you have one, drive it back here to me and we'll get to work on it. Dismissed!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Protectors <|obj|> Use your druidic powers to commune with protectors at the Feral Stone, the Guardian Stone, the Restoration Stone, and the Balance Stone.  <|text|> To fully unlock the powers of the Idol, we will need four manifestations of the wilds - an essence of ferocity, essence of regrowth, essence of balance, and essence of tenacity. To find these essences, we must consult the protectors of the forest. Go to the Emerald Dreamway and call upon the powers of the ancient druidic stones. The protectors will only show themselves to those who can prove their connection to the wilds.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Arcane Inquiries <|obj|> Speak to Myriam Spellwaker in the Military District.  <|text|> Most of us made it here alive. . . but there are worgen on this side of the city as well. We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for. That reminds me, someone was asking about you.  It was a mage named Myriam.  She mentioned something about you being "ready. " <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Call to Arms <|obj|> Kill 7 Boulderfist Shaman and 3 Boulderfist Lords and return to Drum Fel in the Hammerfall outpost.  <|text|> The head of the beast is ready to be taken off. . . with great force, <name>. You have shown every sign that you are able to help us with this final mighty blow. The leaders of these attacks have made their lair within the ruins of Stromgarde, a glaring symbol of human frailty. Find and slay those Boulderfist lords and their lackey shaman who would try and drive us from these lands.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Protoform Synthesis <|obj|> Escort Pocopoc to the Protoform Synthesis Forge.  <|text|> < Pocopoc jumps around anxiously. When you completed your research into the basics of Dealic, it got very excited and it is urging you to follow it somewhere else in this realm. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Disgustingly Damp Flower <|obj|> Take the Disgustingly Damp Flower to Jahden Fla.  <|text|> Rummaging for pollen as usual, you use the harvesting technique you learned from the wasps.  However, when you pull your hand away from the flower, you find that there is no pollen to be seen. Looking inside the swirl of petals, despite it being a mature flower, you see that there is no pollen at all.  Upon closer inspection you see that the flower is filled with a viscous liquid.  Could the flower have done this? While unpleasant to touch, you carefully pluck the flower to show Jahden.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Scrying Stones <|obj|> Find treasures hidden away by magic within Nazjatar.  <|text|> I have a gift for you, <name>. 

It's a stone unlike anything you've seen before. To the uninformed, it may seem to be a simple rock, but it's far more precious than that. 

This is a scrying stone. It reveals objects that have been hidden by magic. When near an anomaly, the runes etched within will begin to glow. 

Use the stone to reveal treasure hidden away by ancient magic.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Situation In Dalaran <|obj|> Speak with Kromthar to obtain a ride to Dalaran.  <|text|> The night elves learned that the Divine Bell was stolen. This much we anticipated. However, they've also found out that the "neutral" Sunreavers of Dalaran were complicit. Now, we've got a situation. I need you to go to Dalaran. Speak with Kromthar for a ride. You are to rendezvous with Grand Magister Rommath once you arrive.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Translating the Ledger <|obj|> First things first, &lt; name&gt; ! We need to figure out what Azuregos wrote in this ledger.  <|text|> First things first, <name>! We need to figure out what Azuregos wrote in this ledger. You say that he's told you to make an arcanite buoy and that this is the schematic? Strange that he would write this in Draconic. That old goat knows I can't read this nonsense. If this is going to work, I'm going to need my scrying goggles, a five hundred pound chicken and volume II of "Draconic for Dummies. " Not necessarily in that order.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Mills Overrun <|obj|> Gather 5 Notched Ribs and 3 Blackened Skulls, then return to Deathguard Dillinger in Brill.  <|text|> The Scourge are trying to form a base at the Agamand Mills.

Collect Notched Ribs from Rattlecage and Cracked Skull Soldiers, and Blackened Skulls from Darkeye Bonecasters. To get to the Mills, follow the road west.  After crossing the bridge, take the next fork north then keep going north.  When you see windmills, the battle will begin.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Time for a Reckoning <|obj|> Meet Wrathion and Majordomo Selistra at Scalecracker Keep.  <|text|> Cadet Sendrax has informed me of our majordomo's plans. Thank the Life-Binder that we have their help. Their interference gives us the reprieve we need to get our wounded back to the Life Pools to be treated.

I wish I could reinforce Selistra but I must keep my guards near the wounded. Go to the enemy stronghold to meet them. 

If there were another way of handling the djaradin, I would ask it. But, as it were. . .

You must do what you must.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Forging a Head <|obj|> Njormeld in Dun Niffelem needs you to use the Diamond Tipped Pick on the Dead Iron Giants at Frostfield Lake and return to him when you have collected 8 Stormforged Eyes.  <|text|> Greetings, <race>. I have a task that King Jokkum felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people. I have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant Hodir's blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect are the very eyes of our fallen enemies. Take this tool, and gather the eyes from the iron giant corpses that litter our fields.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Gazlowe's Fortune <|obj|> Gazlowe wants you to dig up his buried treasure from atop the cliffs overlooking Ratchet.  <|text|> Sink me, you were right! There's a map tattooed on the skull. That cursed Baron - he buried my treasure right under my nose. Or, above my head, anyway. The map points to a place on the bluffs over Ratchet, to the south. Follow the road west out of the city, get atop the hill, head south, then run back towards the coast and look for an enormous tree overlooking the bay. Fetch my treasure and I'll split it with you!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Worthy of Passing <|obj|> Defeat the Guardian of the Elders.  <|text|> The four elemental spirits will help you speak with the land and uncover its plight, but first, I have one small task to ask of you. Join me, my pupil. Accompany this old pandaren to the western grove.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Primordial Answers <|obj|> Obtain a Primordial Earth, Fire, Water and Storm Core from the elementals within the Zskera Vaults.  <|text|> Revelations await us within this vault. Perhaps we'll find a way to protect ourselves against Primalist magic. The elementals hiding in these vaults are wild, ancient, and free of Primalist control. Perhaps they hold the secret to helping the elementals on the surface.

I have an idea. We'll need four primordial cores. Then we can construct a talisman that can purify and remove the influence of Primalist control from the elementals outside.

If you help us, I will share what we have found here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Theotar's Mission <|obj|> Collect 8 Scorched Planks and 8 Regal Cloth Scraps.  <|text|> Oh the Accuser sent you? How keen!

I do, in fact, know the fate of Prince Renathal. . . at least part of it.

When our assault on the Master's keep failed, we were both captured. I was banished to the Ember Ward, but the Prince was dragged off to Sinfall.

I'm cultivating an escape from this Light-blighted land to follow after him, but the Light here. . . it makes it hard to think.

My parasol once protected me, but the ruffians destroyed it. Help me rebuild it, and we'll find the Prince together.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A People Shattered <|obj|> Light the final flame.  <|text|> While the monument here was intended to honor the fallen members of the Shattered Sun, it quickly took on a second meaning for the sin'dorei.

It was not far from here that we lost one of our greatest heroes: Anasterian Sunstrider, the last king of Quel'Thalas. He led our final effort against the Scourge and personally crossed blades with Arthas himself. As we remember the sacrifices it took to reclaim this land, we also remember the sacrifices made in its defense.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Warlord's Council <|obj|> Find out who is behind the written note.  <|text|> Upon closer inspection, you notice a piece of leather parchment looped around his neck. Scrawled upon it angrily are the words: "WITNESS THE FATE OF THOSE WHO DEFY THE IRON HORDE! " <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Get Out Of Here, Stalkers <|obj|> Kill 7 Cave Stalkers and 7 Leech Stalkers.  <|text|> Thelgen Rock's an important site here. We need to use it to study the bedrock formations an' such. Of course, it can't be that easy, so Thelgen Rock's also full of giant cave stalkers. Big as a dwarf and twice as hungry. Like I said, these fancy-lads are researchers, not warriors, so if I want them to get anything done you're gonna have to help me clear the filthy bugs out. Kill as many of the blighters as you can and I'll make it worth your while, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Run For the Hills <|obj|> Destroy the stockpiles of supplies.  <|text|> The quilboar are up to something, something big. You need to stop it! They've been busy bringing supplies up to the caves above their sanctum. Preserved thorns, cauldrons of venom, giant totems. . . They're preparing for war. Get up there and destroy those stockpiles before they can be used against the citizens of the valley!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Unlikely Allies <|obj|> Fly to the Sanctuary of the Devoted.  <|text|> I believe this is one of the Keepers' keys! Only Vorrik would know for sure. 

We need to head to the temple at once.

<|startoftext|> Orgrim's Hammer <|obj|> Seek out Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer flying above Icecrown.  <|text|> The Argent Crusade pulled my ravaged body from the Broken Front. What a glorious battle, <race>. My axe sang as it cut down Alliance filth and Scourge alike. My time is over. It will be a good death. Carry a message for me, soldier. Our base flies out of reach of Scourge - overhead between Mord'rethar and Aldur'thar. It is called "Orgrim's Hammer.

<|startoftext|> The Brotherhood of Light <|obj|> Report to Archmage Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands.  <|text|> The Brotherhood of Light has a history of brash, thoughtless decisions.  They bridged a gap between the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn.  They were among the first to plunge into Northrend, while many of us lingered behind. However, they also have a history of getting results, which I respect.  They fight on two fronts now: one battle in Stratholme, and another, more immediate battle to the south at Tyr's Hand. I suggest you speak with Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand.  You may be of service.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Pressing Forward <|obj|> Bring the Gob Squad past the northern Dragonmaw Gate to the entrance of Grim Batol.  <|text|> Good work so far. We should find the entrance to Grim Batol just past the next gate. I was ordered to secure the entrance and block off reinforcements while the rest of our men press through the path we've cleared up the canyon. I'm thinking if we get there soon enough, maybe I can let Ticker have a little more fun. Let's get moving down the canyon to the southwest - we should find the next gate pretty quickly.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Crocolisk Hunting <|obj|> Get 5 pieces of Crocolisk Meat and 6 Crocolisk Skins for Marek Ironheart at the Farstrider Lodge.  <|text|> Many a hunter is attracted to Loch Modan to hunt our famous crocs. There are always merchants who seek out crocolisk skins for clothing items or armor, and there are also some who enjoy the taste of their meat. We do some trade in this, but not a huge amount, as the crocolisks are ferocious and have entrenched themselves on the islands in the Loch. But don't let me dissuade you, it's quite an experience, wrestling with the jaws of the beasts. Why, this one time. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Last Word <|obj|> Help Sabrina free Inquisitor Darksion.  <|text|> Inquisitor Darksion was an aspiring practitioner of the arcane arts before Denathrius locked her away.

Ahead of us lies the Fungal Vale, an area that the Scourge still cling tightly to.  They use floating constructs to continually re-plague the land, keeping it vile and polluted. The devices are controlled with runes, which are held by dark adepts and shadowmages.  Take the controlling runes that these cultists hold, aim them at the plague disseminators, then overcharge them with this mote.  The results should be amusing.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Unseen Armaments <|obj|> Place a work order for Champion armaments and equipment.  <|text|> If we gonna win dis war, we need to get these Champions of ours better equipment.  

It won't be cheap, or easy, but I can get dem for you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Bogpaddle Bullet <|obj|> Speak with Sharon Boomgetter in the southeastern corner of Burning Steppes to ride the Bogpaddle Bullet to the Swamp of Sorrows.  <|text|> I've heard stories about a road to the Swamp of Sorrows.  Mysterious tales of a meandering mountain pathway that completely bypasses Redridge and poops you right out into Bogpaddle! If you run out of things to do, I suppose you'll have to leave.  And we'll all be sad.  When you do leave, talk to Sharon Boomgetter in the southeastern corner of the Steppes.

<|startoftext|> Withered Flesh <|obj|> Gather 5 Parched Hydra Samples and 5 Withered Bog Lord Samples and bring them to Ruam at Telredor.  <|text|> We must determine how far the damage has spread. The basidium you brought me comes from a bog giant. Their larger, hardier cousins, the bog lords, should prove more resistant to the degeneration that's struck the giants. It would be good to know how the changes in the Dead Mire have affected the other creatures out there, too. Return to the Dead Mire and see if you can get samples from the bog lords and the hydra in the area.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Build One More <|obj|> Build one new construct.  <|text|> All these souls deserve a new construct, and when rebuilt any of them will make a valuable addition to our forces.

Collect parts and use the Abominable Stitching Table to build another construct.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Head of the Beast <|obj|> Speak to Mathias Shaw in Stormwind.  <|text|> Find Shaw in Old Town. Let him know that the Lescovar threat has been dealt with and about your involvement in the Lord's plots against the city. I'm sure he'll be proud to have another hero among Stormwind's citizens. He'll more than likely send you off to meet with the Prince or some other noble. Don't let it get to your head, <name>. The nobles can think they rule the city all they want, but some things remain out of their hands.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Fitting Weapon <|obj|> Go to Shadowfang Keep and obtain the Silverlaine Family Sword from Baron Silverlaine, 5 crates of Moonsteel Ingots, and 5 Deathless Sinew.  <|text|> From your earliest days, <name>, your trainers identified you as a natural talent.

<|startoftext|> It's Goat Time, Baby <|obj|> Use Garyanne's Goat Puncher on 12 Billy Goats in Fuselight.  <|text|> We have a little bit of a goat problem here in Fuselight, in case you haven't noticed.  They'll eat anything, and they seem to have taken a liking to the piles of cogs and gears that we tend to leave sitting around. It's getting really annoying! You'll find most of the billy goats wandering around the edge of town, near the cliff's edge.  Use this device on them to give 'em a little "nudge".  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Skimming Off the Top <|obj|> Collect 4 Volatile Oil.  <|text|> That flying machine is our ticket out of here but its fuel tank is bone dry! We're right next to the oil fields but with the infected out there we don't have time to run a line up here so we need to improvise. The oil creatures moving next to the pumps out there are full of a highly potent mixture that I can drop right into the tank. Grab some of that oil for me and we'll be one step closer to getting out of here.  <|endoftext|>

Thanks as always, these will go great with the rest of my hoard. Keep this up, and I will need to find a new place to stash them! Here's a token for your trouble.

If you know the secrets of their creation, you can issue them basic orders that they will not question. Fortunately for you, I know these secrets. This kit will reanimate the remains of the abominations you defeat. Take it, and learn to use them against the Scourge on the death gate.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Abandoned Outpost <|obj|> Meet up with Naleidea near Zelthrak Outpost in the Azure Span.  <|text|> From what you mentioned, it appears the stone of Vigilance can be found at an abandoned station northeast of the Azure Archives. That must be Zelthrak Outpost.

Meet up with me when you arrive, <name>, and we can find the stone together.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ascendant of Flames <|obj|> Speak with Rehgar Earthfury in the Firelands.  <|text|> As we speak, an endless war rages for control of the Firelands. Of the two aspiring Firelords, Lord Smolderon hates mortals less. If we help him defeat his rival and ascend to Firelord, he may unite with us in return. The champions of the Earthen Ring have already made their way to the Firelands. Go and meet with Rehgar Earthfury and find a way to turn an old enemy into a new ally. If anyone can succeed at this impossible task, I have faith that it is you, Farseer. May the elements be with you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hiding in the Shadows <|obj|> Destroy the three Shadow Orbs in Gul'rok.  <|text|> <The voice of Teron'gor enters your mind. >Our final move must remain concealed from the Auchenai, my minions. Use the shadow orbs Gul'dan provided for us to veil Gul'rok in darkness. Prepare our forces, we march on Auchindoun on my order. We will feast on the souls of the draenei and usher our demonic allies into this world! <Destroying these shadow orbs would help the defenders at Auchindoun greatly. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Emergency First Aid <|obj|> Use a First Aid Kit on Austin Huxworth, Bjorn Stouthands, and Kee-la.  <|text|> We have to patch everyone up before we can begin the search for my. . . for the missing expedition.

Take this first aid kit and tend to the wounded. No one gets left behind.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Practice Makes Perfect: Master Hsu <|obj|> Speak with Master Hsu in the Peak of Serenity and complete your training with him.  <|text|> Welcome Back, <name>. I see you've returned to hone your skills.  Speak with Master Hsu in the Training Grounds below us for a practice sparring session.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Few Things First <|obj|> Obtain 25 Leystone Ore and a Suramarian Sapphire.  <|text|> Lately I've been working with the ore of this land, leystone it's called. I've found its qualities to hold remarkable strength and durability. We'll need a lot of it for this. There is felslate, but that's a probably too tainted for what you're looking to do with this barding. You know, I also like to adorn my pieces with something sparkly, like a jewel. I've heard that the elves of Suramar have particularly beautiful ones. Perhaps you could acquire one for this project.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wing Nut <|obj|> Collect 3 Pristine Flight Feathers from Golden Eagles.  <|text|> I'm through with gyrocopters. Sure, they work, but when has that ever been good enough for a real gnome? I want real flight, with WINGS! I've been studying birds for years now, trying to unlock the final secret to building a machine that flies just like them. That elegant soaring and swooping, the rush of wind over the wings, ahh. You! You can help me. I need the finest flight feathers you can find. The golden eagles circling near the lodge would be a fine choice. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Equipment Blueprint: True Iron Rudder <|obj|> Return the blueprints to a Naval Equipment Specialist at your garrison shipyard.  <|text|> This appears to be a blueprint for some sort of naval equipment.  We should take it back to our Shipyard and see if someone can decipher it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Inspecting the Ruins <|obj|> Speak to Inspector Tarem at the Shady Rest Inn.  <|text|> Poor James never recovered from the destruction of the Shady Rest and the murder of his family. The boys and I are doing what we can to find the monsters who did this. I've sent our best investigator, Inspector Tarem, out to the ruins, but this is too big a job for any one man. If you'd lend Tarem a hand, we'd appreciate it. Light knows, we'd all like to be out there helping. The main road will lead you to the inn, but take care. Your journey will take you beyond the protection of my soldiers.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> If These Stones Could Speak <|obj|> Use the Stone Monoliths at the Circle of Bone.  <|text|> This is a very ancient place, traveler. Only recently have I pieced together a method of translating the forgotten language carved into these stones. Oh, the thrill of discovery! This never gets old, I assure you. Here, you are the guest. You do the honors. I insist. Use this key to unlock the secrets the stones contain.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Dreadful Blend <|obj|> Extinguish 30 Volatile Embersparks.  <|text|> Gravedust and Stipple Weed is a dreadful flavor combination, and Tubbins made a very large batch of tea with those ingredients.

It was so horrid that I tossed the entire pot of tea on the fire. It turns out to be very wet, and an excellent extinguisher of flames! 

Tubbins will haul the entire batch with you. Put it to good use, by tossing it on the Volatile Embersparks around Zovaal's Cauldron.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Report on the Rebels <|obj|> Meet Captain Drine at the top floor of the Seat of the Aspects.  <|text|> I am impressed with what you have accomplished today. I hope you agree, <name>.

We have successfully shut down the nefarious activities of these Primalist-allied rebels. For now at least. We will need to keep a close watch on any dissent going forward.

Return to Captain Drine at your earliest convenience. She will want our full report.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Scepter of Celebras <|obj|> Assist Celebras the Redeemed while he creates the Scepter of Celebras.  <|text|> My scepter was once a source of hope for me. It once granted me power over these caverns. I had hoped to bring peace to the spirit of my uncle. . . For the two parts to once again become one, I will need your assistance in performing the ritual. Please follow me, and listen to my instructions while I channel the energy required to reunite the rod with the diamond. Together, we shall create the Scepter of Celebras once again!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Setting Sabina Free <|obj|> Release Sabina from her shackles.  <|text|> Release me. Please, you must do so. I cannot linger in the Light any longer. 

This unease, it's so. . . familiar, but it will pass. I will feel myself once again, once I have returned to the shade.

I'll stay as still as silence while you work the lock.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> War Marches On <|obj|> Return to Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption.  <|text|> I hope the Horde will think twice about attacking Kul Tiras in the future, but given the actions of its leadership, it is a faint hope at best. Still, what matters most is my people are safe now.

The fleet and marines should be here soon to help the Outriggers clear out what remains of the Horde forces. Please return to High Commander Wyrmbane and let him know I will join everyone as soon as I am able.

Thank you for your swift actions today, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Winterfall Ritual Totem <|obj|> Take the Winterfall Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item.  <|text|> You have found one of the Winterfall furbolg's ritual totems.  The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but it seems to emanate an almost tangible sense of dread and despair.  If many of the Winterfall furbolgs do indeed carry these, it certainly would go a long way in explaining their current condition. One of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item. . . that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dalar Dawnweaver <|obj|> Deliver the Ambermill Codex to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest.  <|text|> Take the codex and travel north to the Sepulcher. Once there, find Dalar Dawnweaver. Dalar is a former archmage of the Kirin Tor. Surely he will be able to bring down the protective wards surrounding this codex and pry its secrets loose. Hurry, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Aid for the Wounded <|obj|> Use Sten's First Aid Kit on 4 Wounded Coldridge Mountaineers.  <|text|> <name>, listen!  Unlike Joren, I've no need for yer blade, but I do need someone with a steady hand and a bit o' courage. Our mountaineers are trained to protect the village from the odd wolf attack. . . not an all-out trogg invasion!  Many of our best have succumbed to wounds and exhaustion, and I need yer help bandaging them up. Here, take my first aid kit and assist as many as ye can.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> What Is This Place?  <|obj|> Kill Corla, Herald of Twilight.  <|text|> <Pip's helm gives you a slight jolt. >What is this place? It looks like they're doing something terrible to that nether dragon. The energy is being siphoned from the creature into that lady! We need to stop this ritual! Kill Corla to get past this hall!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Soothing Turtle Bisque <|obj|> Bring 10 pieces of Turtle Meat and some Soothing Spices to Chef Jessen in Southshore.  <|text|> If there's one thing you'll learn about Southshore it's that we have some of the best cuisine north of Stormwind! Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks to travel from as far as Darkshire just to enjoy a bowl.  Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately.  I used to head up past Dalaran to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt Snapjaws but it's just too dangerous now. If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the Snapjaws up north and Soothing Spices, I'll whip some up!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Woodland Protector <|obj|> Seek out the dryad known as Tarindrella within the Shadowthread Cave at the northern end of Shadowglen.  <|text|> I must ask something more dangerous of you. Strange news has traveled to me through the whisperings of the forest spirits. The mysterious woodland protector, Tarindrella, has returned to Shadowglen again. The dryad's presence has not been felt in the forests since before the blessing of Teldrassil. Something is surely amiss if she has journeyed back to this land. Seek out Tarindrella in the Shadowthread cave to the north. It is dangerous, but we will be prepared with this antidote just in case.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Talon Terror <|obj|> Use the portal in the Dreamway to meet Thisalee at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal.  <|text|> I just received word that the Shrine of Aviana is under attack by the Burning Legion! While the Druids of the Talon here are taking their time planning and strategizing their defense, our brothers and sisters are being slaughtered where they stand. I cannot stand idly by while my home shrine is in danger. Please, come with me to save my people.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Better Late Than Never <|obj|> Check with the Royal Factors of Stormwind to learn the whereabouts of an Emma Felstone.  <|text|> You pick up the package, wiping off a small layer of dust and grime that had settled on it.  It is addressed in a hurried hand to an Emma Felstone of Stormwind; the delivery of the package is dated for well over four years ago. Though it is unclear if Emma Felstone is even alive, it is widely known that the Stormwind City Hall keep records on the populace of the city.  This is handled through the Royal Factors of the Stormwind Census.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dekorhan's Tusk <|obj|> Few elekk have lived as long as Dekorhan.  <|text|> What a find! Great work, <name>! Dekorhan's tusk will be the centerpiece of someone's collection!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Venture Co. Misadventure <|obj|> Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to kill 15 Venture Company members.  <|text|> Ever since we arrived, the Venture Company has hampered our efforts to secure our campsite and survey the area. Normally, we wouldn't care what they were up to, but they've started antagonizing our scouts and shooting down supply flights. We can't allow this insult to stand. Hemet Nesingwary's expedition came here to hunt, and hunt it shall. Go to Swindlegrin's Dig, on the far side of the crystal pillar to the northeast, and kill any Venture Company employee you see!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Salhet's Gambit <|obj|> Escort the Ramkahen Ranger Captain to higher ground.  <|text|> Neferset City is too well defended.  The mountain next to it, however, is not. I've spoken to the ranger captain and he's willing to take a handful of his men and secure the strategic mountaintop. There is one catch, <name>.  He agreed, but only if you would spearhead the attack with them. It must be a small group, else we'll draw the enemy's attention too soon, but trust me. . . the rangers of Ramkahen are as tough as they come.  With you by their side we'll surely succeed.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> I Must Have Them!  <|obj|> Wazat across from Clan Watch in southern Nagrand wants you to bring him 3 Air Elemental Gases.  <|text|> Do you see them? ? By Gazlowe's horrific halitosis, I will have those eggs! Say, you look like you might be of some use. I'll tell you what, <race>; if you gather a few items for me to make my Jump-a-tron 4000 functional, I'll give you a key that will let you operate the machine as well! What can you do with a Jump-a-tron 4000 you say? What can't you do is more like it. . . I'll need air elemental gas from the air elementals of Nagrand. They're all over the place so don't ask me where to find 'em!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Break 'Em Out <|obj|> Free 10 workers.  <|text|> An Irontide captain "Calico McGee" has been trying to scare us off for days now, but it's not working.

He's ordered his men to lock everyone up and sell us as slaves! They've brought enough chains for everyone!

Break the chains and set our workers free.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Recipe For Death <|obj|> Retrieve Apothecary Berard's journal from Pyrewood Village and take it to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher.  <|text|> You can be of further service to the Royal Apothecary Society, <name>. When Arugal cast his wretched magic on the forest, he cursed one of our most promising members, Apothecary Berard.  Now a mindless servant of Arugal, Berard is useless to us.  But his findings might prove to be of worth.  He was studying an ancient plague that killed off all the aquatic life in Lake Lordamere ages ago. Retrieve Berard's Journal from his study in the Pyrewood Village Inn and take it to Apothecary Renferrel.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bulging Nightmare Pod <|obj|> Bring the Bulging Nightmare Pod to Professor Pallin in Dalaran.  <|text|> <The flower has folded inward, to protect itself from the nightmare energy trapped within. >< Professor Pallin would be interested in seeing this. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bearzerker <|obj|> Slay Grolnar the Berserk.  <|text|> High Chieftain Winterfall's absence has done little to quell the rage of the Winterfall. In his absence, their greatest warrior has rose to a position of terrible power. Grolnar the Berserk lurks in the cave at the top of Winterfall Village, gorged on enough corrupt firewater to kill ten lesser furbolgs. He has become a bloated and horrible beast! Our warriors have been unable to face him. . . do you have the strength to defeat him, <class>?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Lunthistle's Tale <|obj|> Hear Zamael tell his tale.  <|text|> Will you assist me, mortal? Hear my tale.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Great Stonemother <|obj|> Speak with Therazane in Deepholm.  <|text|> In order to unite the four Elemental Lords of Azeroth, you will need to seek out Therazane and convince her to join the cause of Azeroth. However, the Stonemother currently has her hands full battling a Twilight's Hammer resurgence in Deepholm. If we lend Therazane our aid she may agree to unite with the Earthen Ring against the Burning Legion. Journey to Therazane 's Throne in the heart of Deepholm. Aid her in defeating the Twilight's Hammer and convince her to join the defense of Azeroth!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> From Whence They Came <|obj|> Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault has sent you to banish 10 Scourge Containment Crystals.  <|text|> My main concern is the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest. They are pulling up immense amounts of ore from that quarry and I'd like to know what they're building with it. To that end, we'll start by weakening their defenses. I noticed a series of crystals scattered throughout the base and I assume they are defensive structures of some sort, not unlike ziggurats. Use the eidolon watcher to destroy any of those crystals that you find.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Myzrael's Tale <|obj|> Return to Zaruk at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.  <|text|> As the stone goes quiet, you're left with a vague sense of unease. Something isn't right. Perhaps you should tell Zaruk of what you've done so far.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Troubles at Home <|obj|> Defend Maldraxxus by completing Daily Quests and World Quests, looting treasures, and slaying rare creatures.  <|text|> Look! Look around you! All around us, foes await the crushing hand of victory.

There is an upset in the balance of power, and with it, the defenders of the Shadowlands are weakened.

The only cure is more combat!

Challenge the houses that sought to disrupt Maldraxxus, bring them to heel under the weight of your boots.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Inner Sanctuary <|obj|> Accept a gift from the Order of the Broken Temple.  <|text|> <name>, your wisdom and leadership inspires awe in all of us!

The Order of the Broken Temple is prepared to furnish you with a full set of armor to aid in the fight against the Burning Legion. Continue expanding your influence across the Broken Isles, and we may yet achieve victory.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Mutual Exchange <|obj|> Use the Automa Hand to activate an Automa Console and obtain the Repository Treasure.  <|text|> It seems the other automa did not appreciate our appropriation of their colleague's hand. They have become hostile.

Unfortunate, but we cannot allow this to impede our progress.

The automa's hand should activate a console within the Genesis Repository. I believe it holds an object of great potential.

After you acquire it, I will guide you to a place that may provide a means to reach the allies you left behind.

Do we have an accord?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Purification of Quel'Delar <|obj|> Immerse your Tainted Quel'Delar in the Sunwell.  <|text|> The Sunwell and the end of Quel'Delar's exile await, <name>. You will find Lor'themar Theron, the regent of Quel'Thalas, and Grand Magister Rommath standing within. Be wary of them and do not allow them to entrap you in their political scheming. Instead, remain focused on your task here. Immerse the reformed Quel'Delar in the Sunwell to complete the its restoration, then speak with Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest. Speak to a Warden of the Sunwell when you are ready to enter the Sunwell Plateau.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Redemption Handguards <|obj|> Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make Redemption Handguards if you bring him the following: 1 Desecrated Handguards, 8 Wartorn Plate Scraps, 1 Arcanite Bar and 5 Cured Rugged Hides.  <|text|> You will find the remnants of our fallen heroes on the corpses of the Lords of Naxxramas. Bring those desecrated keepsakes to me along with wartorn plate scraps and crafting materials capable of revitalizing the cursed armor and I shall craft a fine piece of armor for you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fifth Challenge of Tyr: Ingenuity <|obj|> Attune Irideus' Power core with titanic energy from Tyrhold.  <|text|> As this was not how the Power Core was supposed to be obtained, it requires a re-attunement to the energies of the Engine. The resonance frequencies of the denizens of Tyrhold should bring the core to its full potential once more.

Though I do not wish to sacrifice more of my brethren, I believe this is the only way this challenge may be completed.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Emergency Measures <|obj|> Bloodguard Lorga wants you to go to the Gimorak's Den to the east and obtain 6 Worg Furs.  <|text|> The cold in these mountains is brutal.  We have a day or two before we burn up all the wood from the wreckage. We spotted worgs inside a cave directly east of here.  I need you to find the cave and obtain some furs.  It might not sound like much, but it might be the difference between freezing to death and living another day. Worgs don't hunt alone, so I'm giving you a flare.  It should buy you some time if you find yourself outnumbered.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Prizes for Pellets <|obj|> [PH] Rinling wants you to shoot a marked target and then return the Target Rifle to him.  <|text|> [PH] Shoot a marked target.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wake of Destruction <|obj|> Use the Orb of Suggestion to subdue a Famished Great Shark, then use it to destroy 12 Zin'jatar at The Clutch.  <|text|> Our time here draws to a close. I must somehow follow the trail of these naga captives if we are to discover their purposes in this region. But before I move on, I would see the destruction of this operation! Nevermind their numbers, I have a plan that has the potential to even the odds. Outside this cave, famished great sharks, displaced by these naga, seek food. In their weakened state, they will be susceptible to suggestion. Use this orb to subdue them, then direct them against our enemy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Looming Over Me <|obj|> Go to the Arinor Gardens and retrieve Khaela's Lightweave Loom.  <|text|> When I rallied to the Xenedar, I left behind a valuable tool. My lightweave loom. Without it, I'm forced to labor for much longer to make garments of power for our allies. But you are powerful, much more so than I. Perhaps you could do me a favor. Should you happen to be in the Arinor Gardens, could you retrieve my loom and return it to me? I'd be more than willing to share my knowledge of sewing lightweave with you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Wealth of Whelp Snacks <|obj|> Gather snack orders from vendors in Valdrakken.  <|text|> Agapanthus says there are more snack orders ready to be retrieved, but we both have our hands full.

Would you run out and collect snacks while we tend the whelps?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> It's Our Problem Now <|obj|> Slay 6 Teraptor Hatchlings.  <|text|> Looks like those monkeys will steal anything! Those thieving little monsters have driven the teraptor matriarch into a frenzy by stealing her eggs. Worse yet, the eggs have started to hatch! We've got hungry teraptor hatchlings running around all over the place, looking to make a quick meal out of us! We didn't start this, but it's our problem now. You'll have to head into the jungle and kill those hungry teraptor hatchlings before they kill us all.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Nature and Nurture <|obj|> Fill the vial at the moonwell in Whisperwind Grove and pour it on the ground between the dead ancient protectors in Irontree Woods.  <|text|> The ancient protectors of Irontree Woods to the north have been dead for years, their bodies a grim symbol of the damage to these lands. Every season, we take the water from this moonwell, and pour it on the ground before them, hoping it will nurture new life. If you'd like, you can deliver the water yourself. It is an excellent opportunity for reflection. Take this vial and fill it at the moonwell, and pour it on the very top of the small hill between the three ancients.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Vanquishing Aquantion <|obj|> Geranis Whitemorn wants you to swim to the bottom of the lake east of Suncrown Village and use the Bundle of Medallions on the Altar of Tidal Mastery.  <|text|> That willful elemental ended many lives that fateful day when he revolted against us.  By calling to the lowly murloc to sabotage our rites he subverted our magic and turned it against us. Show him our thirst for vengeance has not waned!  Take these medallions and lay them at the Altar of Tidal Mastery at the bottom of the lake. Aquantion shall immediately answer your summons! Beware, <race>!  Without our magic controlling him, his wrath will be unrestrained.  Destroy Aquantion so we may rest!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Orders from Azshara <|obj|> Take the Dagger to the Makeshift Altar.  <|text|> <Kojo studies the medallion and grimaces. >

Ugh. . . naga.

This medallion is inscribed with orders. Looks like naga have been commanded to invade our shores and seize artifacts of great power.

You know, I recently came upon one such object. See that dagger over there? Nasty thing. Gives me the willies. I swear I hear it whispering to me.

I found it on an island in Stormsong Valley, on a makeshift altar. Maybe if you take it there, you'll get an idea of how the naga intended to use it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Battle of Alterac <|obj|> Enter Alterac Valley, defeat the Horde general Drek'thar, and then return to Prospector Stonehewer in the Alterac Mountains.  <|text|> The Explorers' League believes there are artifacts in Alterac Valley, but the Frostwolf orcs won't let us explore.  We can't allow the Horde to stop our scholarly pursuits!  Defeat the Frostwolf general, Drek'Thar.  With him dead, the orcs will lose their edge. Drek'Thar is in Frostwolf Keep, in the south of Alterac Valley.  Vanquish him, and then return to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Legacy of Tyr: Secrets of the Past <|obj|> Enter Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr in the Badlands and recover the disc.  <|text|> To stop Raszageth from freeing the other Incarnates, the power of the Aspects must be restored.

Inconveniently, the Titans are rather preoccupied and Keeper Tyr is long dead.

Queen Alexstrasza has suggested a plan. In the depths of the Badlands lies a Titan facility called Uldaman. Apparently allies of Tyr may have hidden a disc of his memories there.
 
Word is that the place has been overrun by troggs. Gather your allies, head to Uldaman, and seize the disc in the name of the Dragon Queen!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Waking Nightmare <|obj|> Obtain the Emerald Scroll from the Nightmare Guardian inside the Earthshatter Cavern.  <|text|> Malfurion's words are true, small one.  The rift that threatens to split Darkshore in half also threatens the separation between this world and yours. Let me aid you in any way that I can, lest further rifts between our worlds amplify the destruction taking place in both places. First you must undo the shackles cast upon me by retrieving the emerald scroll from the nightmare guardian that roams the halls below.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rune Ruination <|obj|> Deactivate the three runestones to set Malace free.  <|text|> A cage wasn't enough to hold me, so the vrykul ensorcelled these runestones to trap me in here. Each is powered by a different Felskorn rune.

Unfortunately, they gave the runes to different guardians, who have all scattered to different places around Stormheim.

So, if Sira said that you could have your precious keystone back, you're first going to have to get me out of here.

Then, we'll see.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Aiding the Accord: Emerald Bounty <|obj|> Travel to the Emerald Dream and plant 3 Dreamseeds of any quality in Emerald Bounty soil.  <|text|> The Emerald Dream suffers as the forces of the Incarnate Fyrakk. In its turmoil some of its seeds have trouble taking root. 

In exploring the Dream, I am certain you shall collect some of special seeds. Plant them in soil and nourish them into a bloom, and I hear they will share bountiful gifts with you.

Go forth and help life blossom in the Emerald Dream!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trading Favors: Sanguine Depths <|obj|> Obtain a Medallion of Orientation from General Kaal in the Sanguine Depths.  <|text|> The generals of Revendreth are outfitted with only the finest arms and armor, procured by Sire Denathrius in his unquenchable appetite for power. In terms of profitable trades and exchanges, he has been a shrewd partner in trade to us.

It would please me greatly to see the return of some relics that were traded in a way that benefited him far more than us. There are few things more insulting to my kind.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hot and Cold <|obj|> You are to go to Frostfield Lake, kill the Brittle Revenants there and use the Essence of Ice on the Smoldering Scraps at Fjorn's Anvil.  <|text|> As you stare at the anvil you relive your recent accomplishments, particularly those which brought this artifact to rest here. It suddenly occurs to you that more remains to be done. To the east, smoldering scraps clutter the landscape--shrapnel from the battle fought there. If they could be cooled and gathered somehow, the frost giants would have an abundant supply of metal and the region would be cleared of these remnants of war.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Edict of the Eternal Ones <|obj|> Recover your Dropped Stygia from your corpse.  <|text|> Death appears to function differently for you, Maw Walker. Alas, you have shed some of your stygia.

Return to the place of your passing, and you shall find what you left behind.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Skystrider's Heart <|obj|> Return the Supermechanical Robo-Widget to Bingles Blastenheimer at the Farstrider Lodge.  <|text|> Opening the hatch, you find an imposing looking mechanical device hooked to several wires, gears, and who knows what else. It's easily detached. Time to bring it back to Bingles.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trust Fall <|obj|> Jump from the tower.  <|text|> Let us ponder the meaning of the Archivist's last words: "Victory only belongs to those brave enough to fall. "

Hmm. It could be reference to the Volume of Victory. That is the most well-known of all the writings said to be kept in this tower.

That book is priceless, <name>. I mean that almost literally. We must do whatever is necessary to find it!

But, uh. . . What do you suppose "brave enough to fall" refers to?  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Werk In Progress <|obj|> Locate the delivery.  <|text|> We received an. . . unusual delivery recently. I'm still in a bit of shock.

Some sort of flying contraption released a huge crate just overhead, parachute and all. If it weren't for the wind it would have landed nearby. Instead, it drifted down the hill below.

They left a note too. It would have been lost had it not been wrapped around a sizeable rock.

< Darkrider Arly massages a spot on her forehead. >

I don't know what it is, but if it'll help clear out the area, I'm all for it.  <|endoftext|>

Up in the foothills to the east, you can barely hear the sounds of work, and see smoke rising from a large fire.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Robbing Hoods <|obj|> Use your Hot Rod to run over 12 Hired Looters, collecting 12 Stolen Loots in the process.  <|text|> We're all going to die! ! ! <You slap Megs to calm her down. >Sorry about that, <Mr. /Ms. > <name>. Okay, we need to find a way to get a lot of moolah quickly. There are reports of the Trade Prince sending hired looters into the streets. You could take the hot rod out there and run them down, snatching the loot that they've illegally stolen. There wouldn't be anything wrong with that, right?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Recipe for Destruction <|obj|> Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to recover 8 Fragments of Dimensius.  <|text|> Atop Manaforge Ultris lies the tear in the nether that the void lord, Dimensius, came through. That tear provides Dimensius with a link to the void, rendering him immune to physical harm. If we can get a lock on the conduit that Dimensius is using to keep himself phased out of this plane of existence, we can destroy it and then destroy Dimensius. To do this, we're going to first need you to collect fragments of Dimensius from the void creatures that he sends out to do his dirty work.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rescue at Sea <|obj|> Head out to The North Sea and kill 8 Vrykul Berserkers and 3 Vrykul Harpooners attacking The Wavecrest.  <|text|> Champion, Captain Wavecrest and her ship were sent north to disrupt the Kvaldir in Hrothgar's Landing when they were intercepted by a Kvaldir raiding party headed to the Tournament Grounds. Unfortunately, the Kvaldir far outnumber the crew on board and are slowly taking over the ship. We need you to go north to The Wavecrest in The Sea Reaver's Run, between the Tournament Grounds and Hrothgar's Landing and help the crew fend off the attack.  You should see the ship on the east side of the pass.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Bloodtotem Tribe <|obj|> Meet Oakin Ironbull at Cliff's Edge.  <|text|> The Bloodtotem are led by Torok, a volatile but useful tauren chieftain. He is wary of outsiders, but I believe you have already met an emissary to their tribe-- Oakin Ironbull --whom you rescued at Riverbend.

Use that small thread and you may be able to bring the Bloodtotem back into the fold. Highmountain needs them if we are to defeat the drogbar and reclaim the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. Be on your guard, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hidden Enemies <|obj|> Bring a Lieutenant's Insignia to Thrall in Orgrimmar.  <|text|> One thing I will not tolerate are traitors in our midst, <name>. But I would be a fool to play my hand so early--it would not sufficiently cut the corruption out of our lands and only cause the infection to grow worse. But you, a young adventurer, could go places my agents could not. . . could learn the truth. . . could find the true head of the beast. If you are brave enough, then enter Skull Rock to the east of Orgrimmar, find a lieutenant's insignia off one of the Burning Blade there, and return to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fight Another Day <|obj|> Save 6 captured kyrian.  <|text|> Some of our brethren are still alive in there!

While many were lost in the initial assault, they seem keen on taking any survivors prisoner. I know not what they intend, but given their mastery of corpses we must assume the worst.

Some have already been taken to their necropolis above, but others remain in cages on the ground. Free all you can.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Damp, Dark Place <|obj|> Look for Ikeyen's Belongings inside a cave south of Umbrafen.  <|text|> Soon after I escaped the Umbrafen tribe, I holed up in a cave south of their village.  Little did I know that the cave was being fought over by marsh beasts and spore men! I had to leave in a hurry and left behind a box containing my only worldly possessions. After managing to sneak out of Umbrafen with my belongings it was terrible irony that I would lose them so soon after.  If you're willing to bring them back to me I'll give you one of my very own personal items.  What do you say, <name>?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ascension Calling: Kleia <|obj|> Inform Kleia she is now able to participate in the Path of Ascension.  <|text|> <This scroll details an invitation for Kleia to join you and Pelagos on the Path of Ascension.

<|startoftext|> Scholomance <|obj|> Speak with Apothecary Dithers at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.  <|text|> On the island of Caer Darrow lies Scholomance - a school that serves as a stronghold for the Scourge.  Our enemy dwells within, safely allowed to pursue research that strengthens their power.  A door bars the way, and try as we might no entry is to be had without a proper key. Apothecary Dithers is well versed on Scholomance, and has an idea how to obtain a key.  You have proved your value to me as someone who can get things done; I now entrust this task to you.  Speak with him on this matter.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Price of Power <|obj|> Slay 15 demons to help lessen the invasion.  <|text|> I see, you wish to augment your powers through script.

<|startoftext|> A Special Kind of Job <|obj|> Report to Force Commander Valen at Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in Stonetalon Mountains.  <|text|> You've done an admirable job down here, <name>. Force Commander Valen has taken notice and requested that you see him immediately. He's got a special mission lined up for you - one that'll hopefully put a cold stop on the Horde's incursion into Stonetalon.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Vault Unsealed <|obj|> Speak with Cataloger Jakes in the Dragonscale Basecamp.  <|text|> < Doc Nanners looks out of breath as he hands you a letter inviting you back to the Dragonscale Expedition Basecamp. He eagerly tries to explain. >

< Doc Nanners nods excitedly, awaiting your response. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bright Bait <|obj|> Collect 7 Suncrawlers in the forest north of Anglers Wharf.  <|text|> Certain fish are only attracted to bright lights.  The forest north of here is home to a local pandaren firefly called a suncrawler. You should be able to find them on the base of the tree trunks all around that area.  Bring me back a handful of them and I can use them for bait!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Prophecy of Akida <|obj|> Free 8 Stillpine Captives from cages found in Bristlelimb Village.  <|text|> The images on this totem depict a war between the Stillpine and the Bristlelimb furbolg tribes. The etchings show that the Bristlelimb have done unconscionable things to the furbolgs of Stillpine. Amidst the chaos, a prophecy has begun to unfold: A hero will rise - not of furbolg blood - and save the Stillpine tribe. Slay Bristlelimb furbolgs at Bristlelimb Village for their keys. Use the keys to free the Stillpine captives. Return to Arugoo of the Stillpine when you have freed them all!  <|endoftext|>

Bring back some djaradin tools for us to study and use.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Lament of the Highborne <|obj|> Light the second memorial flame.  <|text|> The next memory. . .

Forgive me. For many of our people, it was when we realized death was coming for us.

A memorial to a particular defender lies to the west, in the place of her home. The light there has no doubt attracted some of the area's lingering souls. Clear them out, and then relight the flame.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Stop the Ascension!  <|obj|> Present the Vrykul Scroll of Ascension near the Thane's Pyre to call him out and slay him.  <|text|> This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual. A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background. A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> For the Cause <|obj|> &lt; name&gt; , I hope you don't mind me dropping by unexpectedly.  <|text|> <name>, I hope you don't mind me dropping by unexpectedly. I was in the area on business. My people procured what look to be some rather nice armaments for the cause. I'm sure that you know best how to distribute them.

<|startoftext|> Dark Vessels <|obj|> Collect 5 Vessels of Tainted Blood from Jintha'alor.  <|text|> The Vilebranch trolls here used to drink the corrupted blood of the god Hakkar himself for power. They boiled it in crude pots before drinking, dark vessels full of unholy strength. Hakkar was killed long ago, of course. But the interesting thing. . . I still see some cauldrons bubbling up there. Bring me back a few and we'll see just what they've got cooking.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Voice of Goldrinn <|obj|> Locate Ian Duran near the Shrine of Goldrinn in Hyjal.  <|text|> Southwest of here lies the shrine of Goldrinn, a memorial erected in honor of the ancient wolf spirit and his contribution during the War of the Ancients. Our new worgen allies have been drawn to the memory of the wolf god - go figure! - and were in the process of cleaning up the shrine. I haven't heard anything from my contact, Ian Duran, in days. Can you fly down there and find him? I've got a bad feeling that Goldrinn's shrine is in trouble. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Preservationist Cleared <|obj|> Return the Burial Banner to the Preservationist's Locker in the Roasted Ram.  <|text|> Ya better return the item before the Preservationist notices it's missing.

<|startoftext|> Sleeping Giants <|obj|> Mage-Lieutenant Malister has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul.  <|text|> I've overheard what you've had to say with Father Levariol. Allow me to suggest that he's not having you go far enough. You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron! I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely. Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Prowler Problems <|obj|> Destroy 10 Sha-Infested Prowlers in Honeydew Glade.  <|text|> The animals have all gone crazy! Normally the prowlers steer clear of the village, but now we can't seem to keep them away. I've never seen them act this way before! The mayor has summoned in the Shado-Pan, but they're not all here yet. Can you take care of those prowlers before they maul one of our farmers?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mine's Bigger <|obj|> Use the Centurion Demolisher to eliminate the Jailer's constructs.  <|text|> The Jailer has deployed a large number of newly forged constructs to oppose our forces. Fortunately, I was completely prepared for this possibility.

Please Maw Walker, ride with our Centurion and direct it in combat.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Feegly the Exiled <|obj|> Kill Feegly the Exiled in the Bael Modan Digsite.  <|text|> Saddest story I ever heard told, <name>. Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. "The Tear of the Moons" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried. Feegly was banished from Bael Modan but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Meet with Mulric Boldrock <|obj|> Speak with Mulric Boldrock at the Training Hall in Stormwind.  <|text|> Mulric Boldrock's messenger just reached me, <name>.

<|startoftext|> Save Krennan Aranas <|obj|> Rescue Krennan Aranas.  <|text|> All these years after the war and Crowley was still hiding enough firepower in that cellar to level half of the district. It might have to come to that, unfortunately. We can't open fire just yet, there is a civilian trapped on the other side of the prison. Not just any civilian, either. Krennan Aranas is one of the most brilliant alchemists this world has known. One of his potions saved my daughter, Tess, from dying soon after being born. Take my horse and rescue him.  Krennan must live.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Leaders of the Fang <|obj|> Bring the Gems of Cobrahn, Anacondra, Pythas and Serpentis to Nara Wildmane in Thunder Bluff.  <|text|> The druids in the Wailing Caverns, the Druids of the Fang, are an aberration.  They were part of an order of noble druids whose plan was to heal the Barrens, but now seek to remake that land to match their own, twisted dreams. The Druids of the Fang have four leaders, and each possesses a dream gem.  Even now their faces haunt me!  Defeat the leaders and bring me their gems, and the Barrens may again know peace. Go, <name>.  You will find them lurking deep within the Wailing Caverns.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Striker's Pauldrons <|obj|> Bring the Qiraji Bindings of Command, 2 Idols of War, 5 Crystal Scarabs and 5 Ivory Scarabs to Andorgos in Ahn'Qiraj.  <|text|> It is said among us that the ornate shoulder armor worn by the mortal races started as an attempt to emulate the wings of a dragon. Bring me the bindings worn by the highest Qiraji leaders and I shall shape them into a set of pauldrons more dreadful than even the wings of Nefarian himself!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Turd Problem <|obj|> Kill any 6 Pridewing Wyvern.  <|text|> We have a little problem. . . <Jibbly points to the large turds covering the base. >We built the Sludgewerks near a wyvern habitat. Now our initial blueprints for the Sludgewerks were drawn up so as not to disturb the wyvern habitat as the beasts are apparently sacred to tauren and orcs. Do you know what's sacred to me? Not getting pooped on, that's what! Between you, me and the wall, the wyvern must die!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Welcome to Orgrimmar <|obj|> Meet with Cork Fizzlepop at the city gate.  <|text|> The warchief will be waiting for our mission report from Exile's Reach. I must deliver it at once.

Well, I suppose I can teach you a thing or two. Not that I care much of your business, but I'd not want it on my conscious that I sent you to your death. But you must first prove yourself worthy. I will tell you, <name>. I do not much like this Venture Company. This land reminds me of Draenor, and I do not like the thought of those goblins destroying it. Perhaps if their overseer at the Sludge Fen is killed, their operation will be hamstrung.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Uncertainty <|obj|> Speak to Chieftain Hatuun in Krokuun.  <|text|> Scattered visions came to me as I meditated. Yellow and red. Shattering glass. A rush of warmth. I see my own hand, but I am afraid to grasp it. The scent of fel--of Argus.

When I awoke, a message had been delivered. Hatuun wishes to meet.

After the defeat of the Legion, I offered to help Hatuun and his people rejoin us. However, they chose to remain on Argus. 

Hatuun has seldom reached out to us since then. Perhaps he has reconsidered.

I will make the journey to Krokuun. Please, join me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Observing the Chase <|obj|> Enable War Mode and slay 1 player within the world.  <|text|> In our observations of your kind's conflict, we have noticed a high rate of escape among the prey.

This is unadvantageous to our observation efforts.

The Observer has acquired a tool we believe will improve your ability to force conflict.

Before I give it to you, we ask that you prove your willingness to participate in such conflicts, so that we know we will receive a worthy return on this investment.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mana Manifestations <|obj|> Kill 9 Kirin Tor Manafiends.  <|text|> Manafiends are nasty creatures. Small and easy to underestimate, but deadly to our magic casters. The Kirin Tor have these pests crawling all over Violet Rise. We will need to handle them carefully. Alone they are easily managed, but in groups they become a different challenge altogether. Go to Violet Rise and cut down their numbers.  <|endoftext|>

He's been making preparations for the final showdown with Thel'zan.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> What We Know of the Naga <|obj|> Tend to the Kelfin's wounds and hear what Fenn has to say about the naga.  <|text|> It feels good to be me again. I have you to thank for that.

Nalridun is the leader of one such cult. They are reclusive, but it is rumored that he has seized an ancient relic that Kil'jaeden kept until his death. Nalridun claims to use it to commune with Sargeras.

<|startoftext|> Capturing the Keystone <|obj|> Venture into Tempest Keep's Botanica and retrieve the Keystone from Commander Sarannis.  <|text|> It doesn't surprise me that Kael'thas has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like Commander Sarannis. Prince Kael'thas is a great many things, but he is no simpleton. In order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter Tempest Keep and claim the keystone.

We attempted to console him, to no avail. Yesterday morning, he left the keep without so much as a word.

I ordered the guards to follow him, of course. He went to pray at the cathedral, where he's remained ever since.

Most of our ogre neighbors used to be warrior-types, but it seems that more and more of them are practicing magic.  I won't have an army of ogre-magi at my doorstep.

<|startoftext|> Heavy Artillery <|obj|> Slay Captain Wormwood and commandeer the Experimental War Machine.  <|text|> Bad news, friend. They're bringing in serious firepower now. We've spotted a tank on the northern hill by the windmill. They can reach the other side of the town from there. We can't let them set it up. What do you say to giving them a taste of their own medicine? If you can take out their commander, you'd have a fancy new tank all to yourself. Imagine the mayhem you could unleash on their invasion!  <|endoftext|>

The remains of my books are still valuable to me. If you can bring me enough of the encoded fragments, I can piece them back together.  Your best chance is to kill the beasts of Azshara, since they have a tendency to pick up just about anything.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Runnin' On Empty <|obj|> Retrieve 9 "Distilled" Fuel Barrels from the Blacksand Spillway.  <|text|> I've never seen this quality of oil! Problem is the oil needed a little extra refinin'. I heard of this system where you use ocean water to speed up the process. I don't have time to waste down here, so I just threw the barrels into the bay. Pretty good idea, I know. Problem is, I'm not sure how to pull it out of the bay. . . Maybe someone of your expertise could help me out.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Need More Info <|obj|> Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the Cult Researchers at Aldur'thar and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis.  <|text|> The Cult of the Damned are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time. . . . Perhaps it's the proximity to the Lich King that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident than ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way to strip them of it! I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Skullsplitter Tusks <|obj|> Acquire 18 Skullsplitter Tusks and return them to Kebok.  <|text|> It's expensive and hard to kill enough tigers to support the export of tiger fangs to the islands in the South Seas. Luckily, we've developed a technique that allows us to take mundane horn-like objects and turn them into undetectable forgeries. The closest match we've found, amazingly, are the tusks of the Skullsplitter trolls. Hey, before you say anything, what the buyer doesn't know doesn't hurt them, am I right? Bring me a large number of them so we can get to work on the monthly shipment!  <|endoftext|>

Kill her and take whatever she carries back here so we can know what's going on.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Stealing Supplies <|obj|> Bring 6 bags of Crudely Dried Meat to Uthek the Wise in the Gelkis Village.  <|text|> When we are not at war, we hunt for meat.  Meat gives us strength, and full bellies fight harder than empty ones. It is the same with the Magram.  They store extra meat so they may fight longer between hunts.  If you raid their village to the east and take their stores of meat, then their strength will fail.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Source Revealed <|obj|> Find Apothecary Staffron Lerent in the Hillsbrad Foothills past Ravenholdt Manor.  <|text|> Look, the actions of a rogue apothecary are not my concern. If he's undermining our efforts, then let me be the first to point you in the right directionIf he's innocent, then he's got nothing to hide, right? I purchased the goods from Apothecary Staffron Lerent. He's working in a secluded area past Ravenholdt Manor in the hills over Hillsbrad. To be honest with you, I thought he was a little odd.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Will of the Genesaur <|obj|> Recover the Will of the Genesaur.  <|text|> I am pretty sure those dwarves took the artifact in that iron fort there. Are you going to go get it?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Shaping Fate <|obj|> Thwart the Jailer's efforts throughout Korthia and the Maw by completing Covenant Assaults, Daily Quests, looting treasures, slaying rare creatures, and defeating Tormentors of Torghast.  <|text|> The Jailer's power and malevolence continue to grow.

Stand amongst your allies, <name>. Push back against the darkness that would consume us all.

<|startoftext|> Fragment of the Past <|obj|> Take the Glowing Key Fragment to Captain Fareeya.  <|text|> <Your eye is drawn to the faint glow of the crystalline fragment. Examining the piece, you trace the partial pattern of a rune that had been inscribed upon its surface.

The fragment appears similar to the argunite crystals used by the Army of the Light to power their armaments. Could this crystal have belonged to the eredar who fought to escape Argus so long ago?

Perhaps Captain Fareeya would be able to tell you more about the crystal. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Thelsamar Blood Sausages <|obj|> Collect 8 Bear Rumps from Black Bears in Loch Modan.  <|text|> There's never a shortage of empty bellies here in Thelsamar, kids running in and out, workers from the excavation coming in after a hard day's work. We're famous for our blood sausages, I don't suppose you've ever tried them? No? Well, around here you've got to work for your meals, and don't think just because you're a fancy <class>, you'll be any exception. You get me some fresh bear rumps and leave the cooking to me!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Fate We Make <|obj|> Rewind history again and see what Nozdormu has to say.  <|text|> We just need to be stronger and faster!

We cannot leave it like this, not with the eggs also destroyed.

I will come up with another idea. Restart time, and. . .

< Eternus sighs. >

Perhaps I will listen to Nozdormu. He keeps telling me I have "missed" something. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Filling Our Pockets <|obj|> Collect 20 Gold Fillings from Southsea Musketeers or Southsea Strongarms.  <|text|> We've looted everything that isn't bolted down around here, but I'm not done yet. If we're bothering to do the Steamwheedle Cartel's dirty work for them, we're going to make as much cash as we can while we're here. I haven't seen many earrings on these pirates, so the gold must be in the next best place. . . their teeth. The Southsea musketeers and strongarms to the south are the higher-ups here; they'll be the ones with the adornment. Bring me back a good fistful of gold fillings.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Unmasking the Yaungol <|obj|> Lure Kobai into the Blinding Rage Trap, steal the Mask of Malevolent Fury from him, and then defeat Malevolent Fury.  <|text|> Simply killing Kobai will accomplish nothing, as he is possessed by a particularly powerful and destructive Sha - Malevolent Fury.

You will use the trap I have fashioned from the Blinding Rage Essences you brought. Lure him into the trap, and then steal his mask. Once you put it on, Malevolent Fury will appear and attempt to take control of you.

Defeat him, and we will have made a victory of this tragic situation. You can find him to the north of the retreat, where he taunts us in insane rage.  <|endoftext|>

Once you've had a chance to peruse the map, you should choose where we will begin our assault.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Planning for the Future <|obj|> Collect 12 Snowfall Glade Pups.  <|text|> We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain. The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance. If Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them.  While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Eye for an Eye <|obj|> Slay Captain Peake and deliver his eyes to Oltarg.  <|text|> Who goes there? Your footsteps are not the lazy stride of a guard. A <class>, you say? Still brave and free? There's no hope for me, friend. I have lost my eyesight and am no longer fit for battle. I dared speak up while Captain Peake savagely beat one of the prisoners. In return he kicked me in the head. And kept kicking. He kicked me blind, <race>. You'll find Captain Peake at the top of this tower. If you seek justice, bring me his eyes. If he does not part with them willingly. . . so be it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Helping the Cenarion Post <|obj|> Falconer Drenna Riverwind wants you to offer your services to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.  <|text|> <class>, there's some tauren by the name of Thiah Redmane that keeps pestering us for assistance.  She's with the Cenarion Expedition, and they've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the the road leading to Zangarmarsh. If you hit Thornfang Hill, you've gone too far. Do you think you might head over there and see what she needs?  I don't want to have to bother Ranger Captain Venn'ren with such trivialities.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Missing in Action <|obj|> Free 6 Captured Demolitionists from their cages around Frostmane Hold.  <|text|> Fer a job like this, I normally bring me whole crew o' demolitionists. With some help in settin' up th' powder, th' charges, and th' rest o' th' gear, the job gets done a lot faster. Those blasted troggs have me men caged all around Frostmane Hold. Now I'm 'ere all alone without th' personnel I need to finish th' job. You look like a capable <class>, though.

<|startoftext|> Arakkoa War Path <|obj|> Advisor Faila asks that you kill 14 Shienor Talonites and 6 Shienor Sorcerers and then return to her in Stonebreaker Hold.  <|text|> The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could charge out to meet them in numbers. They use their summoning circles to rescue their warriors from certain death, but they cannot run from us if we attack their homes. Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northeast.

<|startoftext|> Crane Mastery: Needlebeak <|obj|> Acquire the Needlebeak.  <|text|> So, now that you've got a vibe for how cranes fight, I've got a doozy for you. Needlebeak!

Needlebeak likes to hang out by the waterfall. You bring me its beak as a trophy and I will talk you up a good game to Nesingwary.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Klockmort's Creation <|obj|> Here's your armor, &lt; name&gt; .  <|text|> Here's your armor, <name>.  Furen's process worked brilliantly!  Perfectly!  Marvelously, truly! You could run this armor over with a siege engine and it would spring right back into shape!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Taking of Dusklight Bridge <|obj|> Help Lao-Chin the Iron Belly hold the far side of the Dusklight Bridge.  <|text|> Let's press these insects back across the bridge and break their spirits! Follow my lead.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Safekeeping <|obj|> Take the Contagion Counteragent to Alonsus Faol in Netherlight Temple.  <|text|> It would seem that a delicate balance of holy and shadow magic is the key to curing this contagion. Obviously the remedy will need a bit of work to reduce undesired side effects, like dying. In the meantime, take the counteragent back to Netherlight Temple and keep it safe. I will work diligently on discovering the source of this contagion.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Crystalsong Forest <|obj|> Speak to Kalecgos.  <|text|> The blue dragon Lanigosa lent her aid to mortals during the most recent war against the Burning Legion. However, she failed to respond to the call of the Isles.

Has something befallen her? Or has she simply chosen not to return? Whatever her reasons, Azuregos's globe seems to suggest that she was last seen in Crystalsong Forest.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Informing Our Allies <|obj|> Speak to Archmage Khadgar, Halduron Brightwing, Vereesa Windrunner, and Shandris Feathermoon.  <|text|> Leaders from some of the greatest military factions are here, ready and willing to help.

The farmland at Go'Shek will belong to the Alliance once more. Go, and defeat the Forsaken.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Veil Lithic: Preemptive Strike <|obj|> Break the cursed eggs in Veil Lithic.  <|text|> In the wretched colony to the southwest known as Veil Lithic, Terokk's minions are attempting to befoul their avian brethren before they hatch. The dark sorcerers of Lithic encase eggs in a shadowy curse. When the hatchlings emerge, they mindlessly serve Terrok. Travel to Veil Lithic and prematurely break the eggs before the curse has time to seep in. Even if you are too late, you can put down the tainted ones. Remember, the Light shines brightest in the darkness.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Gambling Debt <|obj|> Taruk at Scalawag Point wants you to collect "Silvermoon" Harry's Debt.  <|text|> I heard you did a little work for Terry.  I was hoping someone reliable would show up around these parts. See, pirates love to gamble.  They, however, do not love to pay their gambling debt. If you're interested in collecting some coin on my behalf, I'd be willing to give you a cut. Let's start you out with an easy one.  "Silvermoon" Harry's a bit of an eccentric, keeps all sorts of expensive blood elf knickknacks inside his tent - yet when I see him he always pretends to be broke.  Get my gold.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Saving the Best for Last <|obj|> Give Mokvar your Beaststalker's Cap and Beaststalker's Tunic.  <|text|> A truly amazing story, <name>!

As to your reward, I believe I have a few things that you have definitely earned and will truly enjoy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Into The Abyss <|obj|> Nambria wants you to speak to Recruiter Burns at Stormwind Harbor.  <|text|> The Horde and Alliance are locked in battle with one another in the seas to the west. Below them, a great host of enemies prepares to carry out a plan that could be the undoing of us all. I am sending you to speak with the admiral of the alliance forces.

Work swiftly.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Through the Old Roads <|obj|> Meet with Inquisitor Cleardawn at Gol Osigr.  <|text|> Lady Waycrest has entrusted me with securing the town of Falconhurst and the services of Master Alchemist Ashton who lives there. However, I have found out no one has heard from Falconhurst in some time.

The skies above the forest are impassable, so we must travel the old roads through Drust ruins in the mountains. A small capable party has a better chance to bypass the growing forces of the witches and to help secure Master Alchemist Ashton.

To that end, I ask you to assist me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Pristine Hand-Smoothed Pyrestone <|obj|> Put the artifact on display.  <|text|> This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition, suitable for display in Dalaran's archaeology shop.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Kick Them While They're Down <|obj|> Slay 8 Sunfury Conjurers, 6 Sunfury Bowmen and 4 Sunfury Centurions.  <|text|> The news you've discovered is fortunate, <name>.  Not only do you get to waltz into Manaforge Duro unfettered, this also presents a great opportunity to deal a blow to Kael's army. Use the mana creature assault to your advantage and pick off any Sunfury stragglers you run into. I do not take particular glee in the senseless slaughter of my own kin the way that Thalodien does, but the tactical advantage here is too high to pass up.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Eye of Azshara: Essence of Balance <|obj|> Collect 1 Essence of Balance from the Wrath of Azshara.  <|text|> Within the Eye of Azshara in Azsuna, a powerful being known as the Wrath of Azshara grows in strength.

<|startoftext|> Your Presence is Required at Agmar's Hammer <|obj|> Speak with the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.  <|text|> <class>, I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them, but you must get to Agmar's Hammer with all due haste! The upheaval in the land this morning is sure to have broader repercussions than just inconveniencing the natives.

<|startoftext|> Ready to Rumble <|obj|> Acquire a Sixteen-Servo-Actuator from Bondo Bigblock.  <|text|> We're going to need a new Sixteen-Servo-Actuator if we're going to fix the controls on this thing.

Bondo's gang at the yard probably has one, but they usually aren't too helpful.

Talk to Bondo, see if you can get us one.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Attack on the Roost <|obj|> Kill 15 Legion invaders.  <|text|> Skylord Shadegrove has been leading the defense of the shrine, but I think he's starting to lose hope.

You will be crossing into the spirit realm. Take caution, for it can be a place of both tranquility and danger.

Place it near one of those creatures, then. . . kablooie! If the bomb doesn't kill the eel outright, it should be near enough to death for you to finish it off.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Bloodsail Buccaneers <|obj|> Report the planned Bloodsail attack to Fleet Master Seahorn.  <|text|> Shiver me timbers!  So the Bloodsail Buccaneers are planning some sort of attack on Booty Bay?  Why, the nerve of those scoundrels.  Booty Bay will always be run by the Blackwater Raiders!

<|startoftext|> Eyes of Fire <|obj|> Kill 8 Burning Flamespeakers or Blazing Overseers.  <|text|> This area is swarming with far more Primalists than I expected. Fyrakk does not generally travel with guards, so I doubt the Primalists are here to accompany him.

They seem to be trying to establish a foothold here. But why? 

Perhaps whatever the Incarnates are discussing will answer that question.

In the meantime, let us thin out the Primalists guarding this area. We cannot risk having them in full force behind us as we cross the bridge.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Deep Reaches <|obj|> Speak to Steeltoe McGee at the Deep Reaches in Stonetalon Mountains.  <|text|> The purpose of this base was to establish a foothold in Stonetalon for Theramore and to open up a supply line to the night elves. The Horde, unfortunately, has given us one hell of a fight. Hellscream's armies are mighty and unrelenting. I haven't seen this type of ferocity from the Horde since the second war. Now it would appear that the mine the Explorers' League dug out is being used by the Horde to "backdoor" us. We need to seal that thing off!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Prisoner of War <|obj|> Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to enter the Nexus and release Keristrasza.  <|text|> Malygos has taken Keristrasza to serve as his consort! ? Unthinkable! She'll never cooperate willingly, but Malygos is a powerful aspect, and will eventually bend her will. This cannot come to pass, <name>. I refuse to allow her to suffer this indignity. You must enter the Nexus and do whatever is required to spare her this fate.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Disrupt Their Reinforcements <|obj|> Defeat enemies around Portal Grimh and Portal Kaalez to gather Demonic Rune Stones.  <|text|> You'll find the Legion front to our northeast, and spaced along it are portals used to gather reinforcements from throughout Outland. We, <name>, are going to destroy those portals! Take this primer.  Designed in Area 52, it uses the demons' own power as an explosive device!  Defeat Legion forces around Portals Grimh and Kaalez to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals. . . then watch the fireworks! ! Go, <name>, and return to me when your mission is complete.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Flare Fight <|obj|> Use Darla's Box of Megaflares to reveal 8 Talonbranch Prowlers and slay them.  <|text|> This operation's stayed pretty discreet so far, but the worgen over in Talonbranch Glade have it out for us. They've been trying everything they can to get us shut down. Some of the workers have told me they've seen glimpses of worgen lurking around the clearing. Take these oversized megaflares. They're bright enough to show anything that gets anywhere near them. Use the flares to look for prowling worgen, and make sure they don't leave here alive!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Valuable Find: Necrotic Wake <|obj|> Obtain "The Origin of Death" from Nalthor the Rimebinder in the Necrotic Wake.  <|text|> Once in a rare while, we find ourselves in possession of an object of exceptionally cryptic origin. These objects allow us a brief glimpse into the realms beyond our comprehension. 

It may seem to you that I speak in riddles, yet so much of this realm is shrouded in mystery, even to us.

There are others that have sought to unravel the history of this realm. Should you happen upon one of their works, I will offer you a trade of exceptional value.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cataclysm: Onward to Adventure in the Eastern Kingdoms <|obj|> Find the Hero's Call Board in Stormwind.  <|text|> There are people across Azeroth that could use your help, <name>.

With our grip on Zandalar on the rise, now is the time to move forward with this objective in the lands of the enemy.

Which location shall we secure next, <class>?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Demonslayer of Tanaan <|obj|> Slay 20 demons in Tanaan Jungle.  <|text|> Look to the north, <class>. The sky is turning a sickly green. Gul'dan's summoning portals are not yet at full strength, but already the stench of demon is on the wind. Slay them, <name>. Destroy as many beasts as you can before they find a way to Azeroth. The Temple of Sha'naar is infested, as is the Throne of Kil'jaeden, although you may find others wandering about the jungle.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Oralius' Adventure <|obj|> Collect a Spire Flamefly in Upper Blackrock Spire.  <|text|> Me n' Winky, off on adventures again! This is the life, I tell ye. No burning air to breathe, an' plenty of ogres to kill! < Oralius rubs his belly. >We did leave a bit of a mess back there in the Blackrock Spire, though. A whole mess of these iron-plated orcs and some proto-dragons marched right on up from the south and took it over. Ol' Winky, he couldn't take the guilt. Went on back by himself he did, to stop them! Or. . . to JOIN them! Winky, ye two-timing son of an orc. Ye've got to stop him!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Cycle of Anima: Etherwyrms <|obj|> Slay Etherwyrms to collect 25 Glowing Viscera.  <|text|> Forge is cold, yes? Need LOTS of anima to light.

< Sika references her scroll. >

Times before now, anima is everywhere, yes? Now it hides. Small bits, weird places.

We know that etherwyrms -- flappy scale-things that are blue -- eat anima. They are not dead, so they are finding anima to eat still, yes?

Maybe if we take what they have eaten, we can use it to light the forge. This will probably kill them.

Sad, yes. But! We will not take too much. Just a little.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Adversarial Blood <|obj|> Find the Skull Piles in the middle of the summoning circles of Skettis.  <|text|> The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book: Gezzarak the Huntress, Karrog the crystal giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vakkiz the Windrager.  They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world. You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa to call them forth at the summoning circles in Skettis.

From the nearby vector of the Heaps, you will find scrapbots and scraphounds. These would be a fine source of spare parts for my construction project.

The Outflow is home to some particularly slimy friends. From them, you will find excellent ingredients for the heat resistant lubricant we need.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> And They Will Tremble <|obj|> Return to Thalyssra.  <|text|> There will be consequences for what has transpired this day.

For now, you should return to Thalyssra. Tell her that we have avenged Margaux and that the Dusk Lily has announced itself to all of Suramar.

You'll notice the forest is completely destroyed in that area; the ogres leave only useless muck in their wake, depriving the Horde of valuable resources. Go and slay the Gordunni there, <name>. Secure the area for the Horde, and only for the Horde!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> By Blood and Ash <|obj|> Slay 80 Bloodfang Stalkers using the Rebel Cannons.  <|text|> The time has come, <name>.  If we're going to put a dent in their numbers, the time is now. We have the position. We have the firepower. All that remains to be seen is whether we have the courage. . . and I sure don't see a coward standing in front of me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sounds of Healing <|obj|> Bring the Resonating Disc to Olea Manu at Faith's Repose.  <|text|> <You hear a soothing sound emanating from the disc as it hums softly. Olea Manu might know more about this. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Fall of Magtheridon <|obj|> Return Magtheridon's Head to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.  <|text|> The source of Illidan Stormrage's fel orc army has been vanquished. The manufactory halts production of its grim product - at least for now. All that remains are a few trinkets and this severed head - a fitting trophy for a hero of the Horde. Return Magtheridon's head to Nazgrel at Thrallmar.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Taming The Tamers <|obj|> Kill 6 Gordunni Tamers.  <|text|> The sasquatch may be a larger threat, but we also need to wipe out the ogres. The Gordunni have been a nuisance to us for too long, and Lady Shandris wants them completely gone.  Let's hope these are the last ones. Kill the Gordunni tamers that keep the beast chained, and make sure they know the price of their meddling.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cultural Significance <|obj|> Learn the importance of sea stalks from people in Boralus.  <|text|> I've noticed your skill with harvesting plants has improved, but I also noticed that you just treat each flower and leaf as a commodity.  The flora of these islands have a rich history, with a deep cultural significance to us. Take this sea stalk, go around town, and ask some of the men and women what it means to them.  Humor me, and I'll make it worth your while.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ground Leave <|obj|> Explore Stormwind.  <|text|> Perhaps we should get an idea of this city, if it is to be our new home. A scouting mission, if you will.

Go, see what this place has to offer. I will follow Wrathion and attempt to help in any way I can.

Try not to upset the locals any more than you must, though. I doubt many of them are used to seeing dragons walk among them.

Meet up with us once you've gotten the lay of the land.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Jinxing the Walls <|obj|> Hoodoo Master Fu'jin in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Enchanted Alliance Breastplates from Alliance players at the Glacial Falls.  <|text|> Hey 'mon. See dem Alliance sitting comfy in their keep? I think they be a bit too comfy, ya? I want ta be jinxing the place, but I be needin' some souls, mon. Not any soul though, only da soul of a strong warrior could do da job. The Glacial Falls in east Wintergrasp be havin' dem special properties to extract da soul. Slay the Alliance there, they be havin' the stuff we need. Bring back da armor of the slain. If there be no Alliance maybe da elementals got 'em, mon.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Regicide <|obj|> Obtain Trol'kalar from Prince Galen Trollbane.  <|text|> Galen Trollbane is a fool if he thinks that he can betray the Ebon Blade. I have had enough of his games. The fallen prince wastes our time playing the king of a ruined throne, while heroes sacrifice their lives to save this world. If Galen Trollbane will not open the tomb of his father, then we must take the sword and do it ourselves. If he chooses to resist, so be it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sudden Isolation <|obj|> Attempt to make contact with the Uktulut tuskarr.  <|text|> We used to trade frequently with the Uktulut tribe in the Waking Shores, but they haven't been sending or accepting shipments for months now. Our letters have gone unanswered. Naturally, we suspect the worst.

Their chieftain, Tutaqan, has always been the reasonable sort. Somewhat prone to strong emotions, but I can't imagine anything terrible could have happened under his leadership.

Could you please check on them? If they need help, we'll happily provide.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Darkheart Thicket: Fallen Power <|obj|> Recover a Corrupted Essence from Oakheart and defeat the Shade of Xavius in Darkheart Thicket on Mythic difficulty.  <|text|> Once we have the proper implements we can use the Heart to infuse great power into your artifact. We need only a source. Deep within the Darkheart Thicket lies the ancient Oakheart, once a great and mighty protector of Shaladrassil. He has regrettably fallen to the nightmare like so many of his kin. As the darkness within him has taken root, an essence of the corruption has manifested. I ask that you recover the essence so that we may draw from its power, and put noble Oakheart to rest.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Consumed <|obj|> Kill 6 Consumed Thistle Bears and investigate the lake they're drinking from.  <|text|> My first concern right now is for the thistle bear families who call what's left of these woods home. Just to our south, beyond the bear shrine, an entire generation has fallen ill. Gruesomely ill. <name>, I don't know what they're suffering from, but it's consumed them from within. It pains me that a whole generation is beyond saving, but we've got to kill them off so that the earth can reclaim their bodies. More importantly, we need to find the source. Investigate the shallow lake they drink from!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Corruption in Maraudon <|obj|> Kill Lord Vyletongue.  <|text|> <name>, I require your assistance immediately! I am Zaetar, son of Cenarius, and I am trapped here after an unfortunate series of events! Before saving me is an option, you must help me clean out the corruption that runs so rampant through Maraudon. Lord Vyletongue is the satyr ruler of the purple crystal caverns. He is an insidious agent of the Burning Legion and his continued presence can only lead to chaos and death. He can live no longer!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Ruins of Solarsal <|obj|> Explore the Ruins of Solarsal and investigate the presence of the naga there.  <|text|> To our south are the Ruins of Solarsal; this is an area that far pre-dates modern times.  We explored the ruins initially and found nothing of note; as such, we left it in peace. Very recently, the Hatecrest naga have occupied these ruins in alarming numbers.  At first, we considered it as the precursor for an attack.  Though that threat is still possible, we believe there might be something else going on. Go there, explore the ruins, and look for anything that stands out to you. Good luck, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Lotus Tea <|obj|> Gather 20 Imperial Lotus Leaves.  <|text|> The mogu really like their poisons and curses. Mama Bramblestaff always said lotus tea cures any mogu curse. I saw some imperial lotus plants in the nearby Ruins of Dojan. We should go gather some of their leaves and keep them on hand just in case the mogu get unruly. Also, this will give me a chance to introduce my fists to some mogu faces.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Dark Iron War <|obj|> Motley Garmason at Dun Modr wants you to kill 10 Dark Iron Dwarves,  5 Dark Iron Tunnelers, 5 Dark Iron Saboteurs and 5 Dark Iron Demolitionists.  <|text|> War rages both home and abroad.  While mighty Dwarven soldiers give their lives in far off territories in the name of the Alliance, our own lands fall prey to the evil deeds of the Dark Iron Dwarves.  They laid waste to the Thandol Span.  Dun Modr fell soon after. We need you to gather force and push the front back.  If you can kill 10 Dark Iron Dwarves, 5 Tunnelers, 5 Saboteurs and 5 Demolitionists, the reserve might arrive in time to finish the drive. Now make haste!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hot On The Trail <|obj|> Look for Snivel Rustrocket in the Orgrimmar Bank in the Valley of Strength, the Auction House, and the Barbershop in Orgrimmar.  <|text|> I'd better start from the beginning. It was love at first sight, <name>. There was just something about that goblin from the moment I set eyes on him. After a wonderful week together, Snivel said he had come into a lot of money and that he was going to take me on a long vacation to the South Seas! Can you believe it? Anyway, he told me to pack while he ran some errands to the bank, the auction house, and the barber shop, but he never came back! I'm beginning to think he's nothing but a big liar!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fortunate Souls <|obj|> Rescue 7 captive soldiers in Spears of Azshara.  <|text|> $p, I am glad to see that you survived the wreck. Many were not as fortunate. . .

I am capable of stalling the enemy here for now, but this position is not defensible long term.

We need to find somewhere safe for our forces.

Once we have taken measure of the wounded we will push on. In the meantime, find as many survivors as you can. Nazjatar will claim no more Horde lives today!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> In Service Of The Lich King <|obj|> Report to Instructor Razuvious in the Heart of Acherus.  <|text|> All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the Scourge. Gaze now upon the lands below us. The Scarlet Crusade scurries to undo my work, while Light's Hope stands defiantly against us - a blemish upon these Plaguelands. They must all be shown the price of their defiance. You will become my force of retribution. Where you tread, doom will follow. Go now and claim your destiny, death knight.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> High Chief Winterfall <|obj|> Donova Snowden in Winterspring wants you to defeat High Chief Winterfall.  <|text|> While we still know very little about why the furbolg have been ingesting this strange substance, I do think it's best that we put a stop to it before it gets out of hand. The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but I think that if their leader is slain, they will not get any worse. Head east to Winterfall Village.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mark of the Demon <|obj|> Return the Demonic Emblem to Isoraen Nightstar at the Temple of Elune.  <|text|> The demonic rune glows in your hand, emanating dark power. A single word, inscribed in demon tongue, glows coldly. . . . . . GRAVAX. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Your Fortune Awaits You. . .  <|obj|> Travel to Palemane Rock in Mulgore and seek out your fortune.  <|text|> "Your fortune awaits you outside Palemane Rock. "The fortune Sayge handed you feels slightly warm to the touch.  Grasping it firmly, you see an image of the Palemane Rock of Mulgore.  Focusing closer in on the image, you see a tree stump that sits close to the cave entrance.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Defend the Stand <|obj|> Commander Falstaav has tasked you with the destruction of any 10 Scourge in the courtyard at The Argent Stand.  <|text|> Despite our substantial successes in the lower third of Zul'Drak, we must still face the onslaught of the Scourge. Such is the way in this frigid hell. The attacks are unrelenting, yet my men need rest. If you are willing, we could use your aid in reinforcing them. Below in the courtyard you'll find no end to the fighting. Dispatch the Scourge there with all the zeal you can muster, <class>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Disciple's Challenge <|obj|> Defeat Jaomin Ro.  <|text|> <name>, I see great strength and great courage in you, and an unsurpassed purity of soul. The hour is young, but I think you may be ready to face a greater challenge. Go to the bottom of the stairs, and cross the bridge. There, you will find Jaomin Ro, one of our eldest students. Challenge and defeat him in honorable combat, and this first phase of your training will be complete.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Slowing the Inevitable <|obj|> Use the Captured Riding Bat to destroy 6 Forsaken Catapults and 40 Invading Forsaken.  <|text|> As much as I want to exact swift and brutal revenge. . . I must honor my son's memory first.  He cared for his people first and foremost. The Undertaker's Pass goes underground below Northgate River.  You must prevent the plague from being deployed while we evacuate our men, women and children to Aderic's Repose. We captured one of the Forsaken's dreaded bombing bats.  I want you to fly the infernal beast as best you can and unleash hell upon those who seek to bring the Plague to our people.  Hurry!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Little Lasher <|obj|> Bring the Crimson Lasher to Avrilla.  <|text|> The little red flower wiggles its tendrils happily. It seems to like you! Perhaps Avrilla would like to see what grew out of the acorn.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Excuse the Mess <|obj|> Help Ambassador Fastrasz restore the embassy.  <|text|> I wish I knew more about how to welcome you to the Dragon Isles, but I'm only the sentry.

< Sendrax motions to the tower behind her. >

You could try talking with Ambassador Fastrasz in the visitor center. He might be able to answer more of your questions before the dragons arrive.

Mind your step in there. He was clearing out rubble last I saw.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Curse of the Necrodark <|obj|> Journey to Highmountain Summit.  <|text|> It is clear that the Old Gods have long sought to control Highmountain. Their covetous desire speaks to the power of this land, and the strength of the spirits that echo through its peaks and valleys.

They will not take our sacred mountain, <name>. Not while I draw breath.

With the Highmountain tribes united, and with Baine Bloodhoof at our side, we will defeat the Darkness. . . once and for all.

Come. Let us take back the summit from the forces that would corrupt it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Deliver the Plans to An'telas <|obj|> Deliver the Night Elf Plans to Magister Sylastor at An'telas in the Ghostlands.  <|text|> You must deliver the recovered night elf plans to An'telas for me. It is to the east, on the southern slopes of Sungraze Peak, just to the northeast of the Sanctum of the Sun. Magister Sylastor is there conducting ongoing studies into the ley-line nexus energy for potential use in our fight against the Scourge. Have him look at these plans to shed some light on what it is that these night elves are up to.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sworn to Protect <|obj|> Talk to Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex in Darkshore.  <|text|> My duty here has been fulfilled as best it can.  Send word to Malfurion that I'll be joining him soon. Good luck to you, <name>.  Good luck to all of us.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Captive Scouts <|obj|> Free the captive scouts: Hazlek, Bakkalzu, Norkani, and Kasha.  <|text|> After we arrived, I dispatched my scouts to learn more about da Zandalari presence here in Zul'Aman. Many returned with useful information, but four still be missin'. If we do not act quickly, da new warlord's lieutenants will offer dem as sacrifices in honor of da Zandalari emissaries. Find my scouts, <name>, and free dem before da priests offer dem as sacrifices!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Horses for Duskhaven <|obj|> Speak to Gwen Armstead in Duskhaven.  <|text|> Saving the horses might've saved the rest of the town.  They have plenty of carriages in Duskhaven, but not enough horses to pull them. Go tell Mayor Armstead that the horses you saved are at her disposal. I'll get things ready and join you in a bit.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Buried Hozen Treasure <|obj|> Find the Buried Hozen Treasure.  <|text|> The map you hold is crinkled, dirty, and poorly drawn, but you can see a big X on a beach. Is there buried treasure somewhere on this island?  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Taralune <|obj|> Defeat Taralune in a pet battle.  <|text|> I strive to teach through non-lethal pet battle.  Are you willing to learn?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Feeding Arngrim <|obj|> You are to feed Arngrim 5 Disembodied Jormungar, then return to Arngrim's frozen image in Dun Niffelem.  <|text|> Arngrim's hunger was legendary. Even in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl. It is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king. No sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dangerous Love <|obj|> Get a Guardian's Moldy Card and bring it to Fenstad Argyle in the Undercity.  <|text|> There's something unnatural about this epidemic of love. It's disgusting, and as it lowers our defenses, it could be a threat to the all of us. It's bad enough that so many of our people are caught up in this ridiculous behavior. But I think that it has spread even to our guardians, who should be immune to such things. Find one of our guardians and see if they've been caught up in this foolishness.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mudrock Soup and Bugs <|obj|> Bring 8 Forked Mudrock Tongues to Morgan Stern in Theramore.  <|text|> I'm working on a dish I call "Mudrock Soup and Bugs. "  I still need the major ingredients, and. . . well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through Dustwallow Marsh! So, <name>, can you do some hunting for me?  First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles.  You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay. But I don't want just any tongues!

<|startoftext|> A Question of Quillpower <|obj|> Ride the Ornery Battleboar out of Briarback Kraul and report to Mayor Roz.  <|text|> I can't believe you managed to kill that thing. You're quite impressive, you know that? Either way, we should be getting back to Roz with our report. We're stuck in the middle of the kraul, surrounded by angry quilboar. But I have a plan! Some of the boars seem reasonable enough. I gave them a bit of my rations and they've been following me around. I bet we can use them to hitch a ride out of this place. You in?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Honoring a True Leader <|obj|> Meet Master Gadrin at the Golden Road in Zuldazar.  <|text|> Vol'jin. I have often felt our old chieftain's spirit whisperin' to me.

The package took weeks to arrive, and Hemet's long gone by now.  He said he was going to Stranglethorn to hunt the beasts there, but he left me some money to send his delivery when I could. Hemet's a rich dwarf and it's a good idea to keep up relations with the rich ones, yeah?  So. . . you want to deliver the package for me?

Kil'jaeden.

We must ensure he does not escape our grasp this time, <name>. Storm the tomb. Break the Legion's hold. End the Deceiver's reign.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> You Must be This Height <|obj|> Tell Gazlowe to activate the device.  <|text|> You and the Greasemonkeys got this machine up and running even faster than I expected.

The gnome we captured is keeping her mouth shut, but that shouldn't be a problem. I can take it from here.

Let me know when you're ready. I'll crank up this machine to max and we'll finally see what it can do.

I hope it prints gold coins. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> By Her Lady's Word <|obj|> Speak to Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar, Lady Sira'kess, and Overseer Idra'kess.  <|text|> Lady Sira'kess has begun preparations for the ritual of summoning, but the Crucible of Nazsharin has been stolen from us. The Kvaldir have surely taken it with them as they retreated to shallower waters. Speak to the caste leaders to secure a war party, and then lead them in retrieving the artifact from Biel'aran Ridge to the east. I trust you my Battlemaiden, for you have never failed in any task that I have given you. As I am revered to the Queen, so are you revered to me. Go with my blessings.  <|endoftext|>

But, I think I know what will send them packing, as well as get me some personal retribution. They have a murloc chieftain that calls itself Mmmrrrggglll. It wanders the Golden Strand south of the river inlet. The beast once slew a compatriot of mine, and now wears his ring in open defiance and mockery. Slay Mmmrrrggglll, and bring back my friend's ring. Then we shall see these monsters cowed!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Into the Breach <|obj|> Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to kill Iron Thane Argrum.  <|text|> If we can't overcome the defenders inside Thor Modan, the iron dwarves can hold out forever. The Earthen are bravely taking on the constructs built by the sons of iron, but they cannot break into the city. The tunnels narrow too quickly for my fellow giants to be of use, so our options are few. Would you be willing to venture into the city and kill the dwarf commanding the resistance?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Plagued Lands <|obj|> Capture a living Rabid Thistle Bear and bring it back to Tharnariun.  <|text|> A sickness spreads across the Darkshore, gripping the minds and bodies of all it touches.

Yeah, that Lonika. The one who founded the 'School of Roguery' in Shattrath City.

So, let's send Vanessa there out to Outland and have her make Lonika an offer she can't refuse. Or, you know, give her a legit job and a nicer location for her rogue academy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> This Old Waystone <|obj|> Open the Waystone to Oribos.  <|text|> The Jailer has withdrawn his forces. I should be relieved, but I fear this means he has found a way into the Sepulcher.

< Elder Ara trembles. >

Despite Elder Kreth's doubts, you have proven to be an ally. Something we need more of.

When our expedition arrived in Zereth Mortis, we discovered a dormant waystone. If you are indeed a Maw Walker, then the prophecies tell us that you will be able to activate it.

If your allies can save this sacred place, then the path to them must be opened.

Come.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fame Waits for Gnome One <|obj|> Meet with Tinkmaster Overspark in Boralus.  <|text|> Tinkmaster Overspark requests your assistance on an important research expedition.

<|startoftext|> Sniffing Out the Perpetrator <|obj|> Mount Frostbite and ride her to the source of the scent from Brann's note.  <|text|> Boktar can have his way this time, but I'll expect him to make it up to me. Don't look at me like that. Boktar may be in command, but no one tells a hunter what to do. 'Put that beast away, ' he says. 'Make it stop growling. 'All of a sudden he changes his mind when it suits him. Next time he complains, Frostbite'll just nip him a bit. Don't worry, she'll do an admirable job tracking your prey. After she locates her target, you're on your own to deal with iron dwarves, or Brann, or whatever you find.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bang a Gong!  <|obj|> The Scarab Gong looms ominously before you.  <|text|> From the ground near the gong springs a special crystal. Perhaps favor from the Brood.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Betrayed <|obj|> Destroy the arcane focusing crystal tied to Magus Rimtori and then slay her.  <|text|> A few more moments of thought brings a few ideas to mind, one of which brings a smile to your face: perhaps destroying the crystals would upset the blood elf responsible for the slaughter of so many orcs and the betrayal of Belgrom? You continue to decipher more of the script and pictures and realize that one of the crystals is tied to the creator of the circle--the others are tied to something far more sinister. You close the book and begin to decide which crystal to destroy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Shameful Waste <|obj|> Bring 15 pieces of Warsong Lumber and 5 Satyrnaar Fel Wood to Gnarl at Forest Song.  <|text|> Welcome to Forest Song, <class>. Where you see tents, there will one day be buildings, but such ambitions require a steady stream of building materials. I cannot bring myself to order our workers to fell any of the ancient trees of this grove, but our neighbors to the south and west have no such reverence for the forest. We shall relieve the Warsong loggers of their excess, and reclaim some of the tainted wood from the satyr stronghold to the west. Bring the wood to Gnarl, who will purify it for our use.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Report to General Kirika <|obj|> Speak with General Kirika at the Horde encampment near Hive'Regal.  <|text|> You must be one of General Kirika 's new recruits. It's about time you showed up. Bodies wear down quick in the desert. The dwarves have been getting reinforcements daily, and we can't afford to lose ground in our struggle for resources in Silithus. Get your instructions from the General. It's not my job to train you, just find you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Stealing Their Thunder King <|obj|> Find the Bottom Fragment of Lei Shen's Tablet and restore the Tablet of Thunder.  <|text|> Our only hope is to find the Thunder King's remains before they do. He must be buried within the Tomb of Conquerors. Getting to his remains will not be easy, <name>. The tomb will no doubt be defended by guardians and other unfriendly surprises intended to ward off thieves. Once inside we will need to figure out where his remains have actually been placed.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Fall of Kel'Thuzad <|obj|> Take the Phylactery of Kel'Thuzad to Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.  <|text|> The phylactery is all that remains of the master of Naxxramas. Your better judgment dictates that you destroy the phylactery, preventing the lich from ever reforming. Thankfully, you seldom listen to that internal voice of reason. Someone at Light's Hope will pay you hugely for this artifact. Who cares if Kel'Thuzad regenerates to full power?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Orik Trueheart and the Forgotten Shore <|obj|> Seek out the assistance of Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight.  <|text|> I have gazed upon the orb and seen the path that you must walk, <name>. Many years ago an atrocity was committed upon the shores of Dragonblight. The act itself remains shrouded in darkness, but I am certain that your destiny lies south, amidst the ruins of the Forgotten Shore. Take the road southeast through the ravaged town square. Follow the trail until you arrive at Dawn's Reach. You will meet an old friend of mine there known as Orik Trueheart. He will be expecting you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cause Without a Rebel <|obj|> Listen to Alexstrasza's conversation with Maldra Flametongue.  <|text|> Good to see you again, <name>! Alexstrasza doesn't think we can stop the rebels effectively through force, despite the successes you've had.

To find other ways forward, Alexstrasza has called Maldra Flametongue here to talk about the rebellion and what drew her to it.

Perhaps it would be helpful to join the conversation, and see what Maldra has to say. To avoid prying rebel eyes and ears, they will be meeting below us, on the second level of the Seat of the Aspects.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bring Home the Beacon <|obj|> Use the Advanced Telemancy Beacon to survey Evermoon Commons, Evermoon Bazaar, and Siren's Vigil in Suramar City.  <|text|> The conduit we need is in the Arcway, and security in the Arcway has doubled since your last visit.

Our only reasonable option is to teleport your strike team directly in. 

This is a long-range teleport to a non-anchored destination. In other words, it will be hard.

Take this beacon and survey the commons in Suramar City, then return the beacon to me so I can analyze the results. 

This will help me teleport you as close as possible to the conduit!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Twilight Scheming <|obj|> Use the Glowing Torch to destroy 8 copies of The Twilight Creed in the Domicile of Blackrock Depths.  <|text|> It wasn't enough for their master to break the world, no! Twilight's Hammer is doing its best to unite our enemies against us, particularly in Blackrock Depths. They've got a whole team of emissaries down there spreading propaganda aimed at starting a joint campaign. I've always heard that the medium's the message. Well, it's time to destroy the message! I want you to go into the Domicile of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn those Twilight's Hammer books!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Akama's Promise <|obj|> Bring the Medallion of Karabor to A'dal in Shattrath City.  <|text|> <Akama inserts the crystal into the medallion in his hand. >I am not as strong as I once was, <name>.  Being so close to evil itself all these years - I do not know if I can trust myself with an artifact as powerful as this. Take this as my promise to you that when the time comes and you face Illidan, I will be on your side.  Take it to the one being we know we can trust with its power.  Take the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Safety in Numbers <|obj|> Speak to King Genn Greymane in the military district.  <|text|> It is time we joined with the other survivors. The others mentioned that King Greymane and his royal guard are just south of here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Highborne <|obj|> Speak to Estulan.  <|text|> Estulan, a powerful and uncorrupt Highborne, has managed to enter the western wing of Dire Maul and has asked for assistance in cleansing it. Regardless of your personal convictions of the Highborne, it is an effort I must support for the good of Feralas. May the wind carry your spirit there with great swiftness. You will find Dire Maul to the southeast.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> I Can't Wear This <|obj|> Get Grandma's Good Clothes.  <|text|> What was it you wanted again? Oh, right.  The evacuation orders. Well I can't be expected to go out in public like this, can I? Go get me my good clothes.  They're on the clothesline right outside. <You struggle in vain to convince Grandma Wahl that what she's wearing will do. >You young people truly have no manners.  Were you raised by ogres?  Now go get my clothes, sweetie.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Nemesis: Manslayer <|obj|> Kill 500 Human Players in Player versus Player combat across Draenor.  <|text|> < Raza'kul hands you the bloody heart. >The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death. Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all humans that stand defiantly against the Horde. Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Alliance: they will leave Draenor or they will die. Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of man. Conquer our enemy and be known as manslayer. Fail and be nothing.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Zero Xuks Given <|obj|> Speak with Bony Xuk to observe him communing with Gro the Uncreator.  <|text|> The spirits have spoken to me. They believe the magnaron, Gro the Uncreator, will join our fight and lead his underlings against the Iron Horde. This is an honor beyond any bestowed upon a Laughing Skull, at least in my time. I will commune with the magnaron, and together we shall destroy the Iron Horde.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Old Hillsbrad <|obj|> Andormu at the Caverns of Time has asked that you venture to Old Hillsbrad and speak with Erozion.  <|text|> To the west is the timeway to Hillsbrad of the past - 7 years to be exact. Forces are working against the Horde warchief, Thrall, attempting to prevent him from ever escaping Durnholde Keep. If Thrall never escapes, this world - as you know it - will cease to exist. Gather a group of adventurers and take the timeway to old Hillsbrad. Two of our agents await you inside. Speak with Erozion on the other side.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Patience of Princes <|obj|> Delve underground and fell the Primalist blockade.  <|text|> The centaur's report of Primalist forces pushing into the underground after Fyrakk changes the situation. Wrathion and I believe it would be a tactical mistake to dawdle here any longer, waiting for Ebyssian and his devotee to arrive.

We still wish for you to join us. If you are ready, then we three should proceed together.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Winterfall Firewater <|obj|> Bring the Empty Firewater Flask to Donova Snowden in Winterspring.  <|text|> This vial that you picked up from the Winterfall furbolg is empty, but you can detect a few drops of a strange green liquid inside; it almost glows. Is it something important? Donova Snowden would probably be able to tell you more, since she has been camped by the hot springs in Winterspring for some time now.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Farwhisper the Elder <|obj|> The heavens, in their countless stars, hold answers to earthly mysteries, &lt; name&gt; .  <|text|> The heavens, in their countless stars, hold answers to earthly mysteries, <name>.  Might, then, the wise, and the lucky, gaze up and find truth?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Brutal Politics <|obj|> Gain a Friendly reputation with the Magram, then speak with Warug.  <|text|> Desolace is a land at war.  The centaurs wage war with each other, and we believe the victor among them will spill out and threaten our strongholds.  That, we cannot allowWe must learn how to beat the centaurs, and to do that. . . we must ally with one of the clans.  The Magram centaurs war with the Gelkis.  If you fight the Gelkis then the Magram might consider an alliance. Earn the favor of the Magrams then speak with Warug, in the Magram village in southeastern Desolace.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Staghelm's Requiem <|obj|> You have been tasked with slaying opposing troll players in Alterac Valley.  <|text|> Staghelm has given the order. All trolls on the field of battle must be exterminated. Their preposterous claims of birthing night elves must be met with force and due prejudice. Slay them and return to me with their mojo. To reiterate: I want you to steal their mojo.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Anthion's Parting Words <|obj|> Return to Deliana in Ironforge with a set of Magister's Boots, Magister's Leggings and Magister's Mantle.  <|text|> Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet.  In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us. The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the medallion back together.  Return to Deliana and tell her that Bodley is her only hope for finding the remaining pieces.  Speak to her about any rewards you've arranged for. I, for once, shall rest in peace.  I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Promise of Earth <|obj|> Speak with Advisor Sevel in the Heart of Azeroth.  <|text|> Deepholm thanks you, shaman. The Twilight's Hammer has always sought dominion over my kingdom, but this latest threat was far greater than their previous efforts. For your service to the elements of earth, I will pledge my armies to the Earthen Ring in the defense of Azeroth. I have no love for the mortal races, but this world is not the Burning Legion's to destroy. Tell your Earthen Ring that Therazane the Stonemother stands with them!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Blast the Gateway <|obj|> Magistrix Seyla at the Throne of Kil'jaeden wants you to use the Sizzling Embers to summon a Living Flare and slay Incandescent Fel Sparks near it until it becomes an Unstable Living Flare.  <|text|> We have to shut down this gateway to stop Legion reinforcements to the Isle of Quel'Danas. Take these embers, they contain one of my creations: a living flare.  It is designed to act as a powerful destructive force - as long as it has been provided enough energy. Find the fel sparks that wander the area and slay them near the living flare.  The flare will grow in power each time, until it becomes unstable. Once you've achieved this bring the flare to the gateway.  It will know what to do.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> X Marks. . . Your Doom!  <|obj|> Enter Zul'Aman and visit Halazzi's Chamber, Jan'alai's Platform, and Akil'zon's Platform.  <|text|> How did those fools fail? I told them to be careful - even gave them disguises to help them blend in. Ahh, well. The bright side of their failure is that this opportunity falls to you. Succeed, and you'll be well on your way to joining my crew and sharing in the immeasurable fame that will soon be mine. Not that I need any more, mind you. There are yet a few portions of my map that require further exploration before our excavation can be initiated. . . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Invasion Begins <|obj|> Slay 15 demons and change the Legion banner to take control of Despair Ridge.  <|text|> Our advance force of demon hunters is here and has engaged the Legion.

Make our presence known. Let's send a shiver down every demon spine. Raise our colors with pride, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Damned <|obj|> Novice Elreth requires 6 Scavenger Paws and 6 Duskbat Wings.  <|text|> My duties include tending to our wounded warriors, tailoring armor and clothes, and assisting Shadow Priest Sarvis with whatever else he might need. From the look of it, you'll be enlisted in his service also. . . hunting the Mindless Ones, if I know his mind. Well, if you'd like to stay in one piece--and I've no doubt you do--perhaps I can help. I'm running out of paws and wings, and if you bring me some, I'll find some armor for you. You'll find a good number of wolves and bats to the south.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Back in Black <|obj|> Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, "Back in Black".  <|text|> Before you head into the Black Temple, we need more information. The last thing we want is for you to teleport into a trap.

We must discern their force structure, patrol schedule, new defenses, and what Akama eats for breakfast.

<Belath grins. >

I suggest you send our broken warriors to handle this. They can blend in with the rest of Akama's Ashtongue forces inside the temple. We'll get what we need to know from the ones that make it back.

A champion handler or two can scout outside the temple.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mazu's Breath <|obj|> Drink the Potion of Mazu's Breath.  <|text|> Here to help, are ya? Well, first thing's first. <Arie rummages through her pockets for a moment before producing a small vial of glowing blue fluid. >Here it is! "Mazu's Breath. " Cap'n's own formula. What? You thought I'd send you out to sea without a means of breathin'? I need deckhands, not corpses! Down the hatch with it, green. This'll give you a fighting chance out there on the shelf.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Stolen Silver <|obj|> Bring the Stolen Silver to Gazrog in the Crossroads.  <|text|> You may have killed the raptors, but the silver they stole must be recovered!  I have reports that the raptors have a large grouping of nests south of Ratchet, known as the Raptor Grounds.  It is likely that they brought our stolen silver there. Go to this raptor haven and search for the stolen silver.  When you find it, return it to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ending the Madness <|obj|> Defeat Akunda the Exalted.  <|text|> Akunda the Exalted is not who he seems. 

He poisoned the eternal spring, sickening all who drank from it. Even I was not immune to his abhorrent alchemy.  

Now he drains my power, abusing my gift to wipe the minds of all who might try to stop him. 

We will not let him succeed. 

What little power I have left, I will lend to you. 

Use it to call the storm and end the madness that has taken over my temple.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Captian's Whistle <|obj|> Bring Anne Dunworthy 100 Artifact Fragments for a Captian's Whistle.  <|text|> Good work. Use this whistle to call one of our very best to the battlefield when you need them the most.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Capturing a Clefthoof <|obj|> Use the Clefthoof Lasso on a Young Icehoof and follow it until it is tamed.  <|text|> Greetings, friend. I have been told that you are in need of a master of beasts. I come from the icy slopes of Northrend to finally shake this snow from my fur. This savage land holds many creatures that we may tame so that our forces may ride on formidable war mounts. The mighty clefthoof reminds me of the mammoths from my home. Take this lasso and head out to the northern reaches of Frostfire Ridge. Mount up and use it to capture one of the young beasts.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Forsaken <|obj|> Speak with High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.  <|text|> I know it seems strange, but these Forsaken are here to help. You should speak with their leader, High Executor Mavren. He's in the tower on the west side of town. And, <class>, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Don't Be So Shellfish <|obj|> Collect 15 Water-Infused Shells and 15 Wind-Infused Shells from Soggymaw and Windyfin Gorlocs.  <|text|> I was a fool to doubt Iskha when he insisted there was more to this. He wouldn't be my mate if he wasn't always two steps ahead of me.

We can make it up to him--by taking action, of course. If it's shells that are causing all this elemental chaos, why don't you go into their camp and take those shells right out of their slimy hands?

Bring back piles of the wind and water shells, enough for Iskha to research to his heart's content.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Aiding the Wharf <|obj|> Collect a Satchel of Seaweed, a Bundle of Vellum, and some Seal Blubber from around Anglepoint Wharf.  <|text|> We have read the tides, and never before have I seen them in such turmoil. They call to the tidesages, begging for help. A debilitating sickness is running rampant amongst the villagers, and it comes from the sea. We are but few. There is only so much we can do! Please, take this list and gather the listed reagents from around the pier while I attempt to calm these folks. I should be able to create a tonic that will help. I hope.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Healing Nordrassil <|obj|> Defeat Azerite elementals and seal Azeroth's injuries at Nordrassil.  <|text|> Azerite elementals are runnin' wild, driven mad by Azeroth's pain. They're menacin' the spirits o' nature that protect the World Tree.

The roots o' Nordrassil run deep, nurtured by these sacred waters. For the sake o' Azeroth's world soul, the tree must be defended.

Quiet the restless elementals and use yer Heart o' Azeroth tae mend the wounds ye find. We cannae let Hyjal become another gapin' scar like Silithus!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> WANTED: Sisters of Torment <|obj|> Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to slay 4 Sisters of Torment.  <|text|> It has been whispered to Mah'duun that the sisters of torment are to be sent back to the hells from which they sprang. Mah'duun knows that these demons can be found at the Magisters' Terrace on the Isle of Quel'Danas. You will do this thing to earn the bounty, or you will not.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Something for the Pain <|obj|> Captain Brandon at Drak'Sotra wants you to collect 5 Mature Water-Poppies from Drak'Sotra Fields.  <|text|> Gritty as my men are, they're still mortal. Wounds and pain diminish their ability to perform their missions. No amount of training changes that simple fact of life. Thankfully, one of our alchemists has developed a recipe for a salve that binds to our bandages and greatly reduces the pain our soldiers experience. The salve requires a special poppy these trolls cultivate just west of here. Go to Drak'Sotra Fields and harvest some of them to keep our stockpiles from running out.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Corruptor's Scourgestones <|obj|> A Corruptor's Scourgestone was the insignia of the Scourge's overlords.  <|text|> More and more scourgestones pile up by the day, <name>, from yourself and a growing number of other adventurers. Fortunately, none of our soldiers have mysteriously disappeared nor have I heard more bloodcurdling screams than what is normal for this region. I would rather not ask questions. Here is your reward.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Arts and Crafts and Baths <|obj|> Help clean up paint around the Little Scales Daycare.  <|text|> Our arts and crafts activities today have gotten well out of hand. One of the whelps enchanted their brush and the rest followed suit. Now there is a coat of paint over everything.

Please clean up the daycare while we get the paint off the whelps.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Security First <|obj|> Defeat Rare enemies on the island of Mechagon.  <|text|> Many dangerous creatures and allies of my father still seek to destroy us.

Help secure this island, seek out and and eliminate five of our most powerful enemies.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hints of a New Plague?  <|obj|> Speak to Kinelory.  <|text|> < Quae begins to go through the folder. >This IS interesting. Seems Apothecary Jorell has been working on some deadly experiments here at Go'Shek. Not sure what that has to do with Hillsbrad, but Phin wouldn't like it if we let it continue. We had a run-in with some orcs while you were gone, and I'm not in good enough shape to help Kinelory. If you're up for it, she's going to need some protection when she goes down to the farm to steal whatever research Jorell still hasn't sent to Tarren Mill.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dragon Isles Tailoring <|obj|> Draconic weaving is an ancient art.  <|text|> Draconic weaving is an ancient art. It takes decades, perhaps centuries, to master.

<|startoftext|> Icy Scale Gauntlets <|obj|> Craftsman Wilhelm at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 5 Frozen Runes, 16 Heavy Scorpid Scale, 5 Essence of Water, 3 Cured Rugged Hides and 200 gold.  <|text|> Thanks to you and Omarion (May he rest in peace), I am now able to create Icy Scale gauntlets. All you need to do is bring me the materials and pay a small crafting fee.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Defias Brotherhood <|obj|> Take Shaw's report to Gryan Stoutmantle in Westfall.  <|text|> The Stonemasons' Guild was run by a man named Edwin VanCleef.  VanCleef was responsible for rebuilding Stormwind after the orcs razed it in the First War.  Apparently, VanCleef and his men were unhappy with their treatment by the King after the reconstruction was complete.  That just might explain a thing or two. I have written a more detailed account for your Master in Westfall.  Take this to him at once!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Replenishing the Healing Crystals <|obj|> Acquire 6 Vials of Moth Blood from the nearby Vale Moths and bring them to Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.  <|text|> We are the draenei.  Our ship crashed and, since we have many wounded, our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals.  We must replenish them quickly! Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths.  Their blood will make for a suitable substitute. The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but mostly in the northwest.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bound With Wood <|obj|> Obtain 8 pieces of Fragrant Corewood.  <|text|> <Vu eyes the recipe. >Hmm. . . "bound with wood". We don't typically brew with wood. Sap, yes. . . but not wood. We have, on rare occasions, infused our drinks with corewood from the treants to the west of here. Most of them have fallen to the mantid. . . but their remains should suffice for our recipe.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Redridge Rally <|obj|> Glide through the rings.  <|text|> Fly through the checkpoint rings marking the course. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(76536)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Brassbolts Brothers <|obj|> Bring the crate of crash helmets to Wizzle Brassbolts at Mirage Raceway in Thousand Needles.  <|text|> You ever heard of the Shimmering Flats?  It's a stretch of salt flats way over in Kalimdor, just south of the Thousand Needles canyon.  It's a great place for racing because, well, it's so flat! A couple of gnome brothers are out there, friends of mine, trying out their new rocket car, and from what I hear it's fast!  Heh, so fast that their pilots keep crashing.  Giving themselves concussions. So they asked me for some Siege Engine helmets, but I have duties here.  I can't make the trip! Can you?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Odds and Ends <|obj|> Collect 4 Organic Matter Samples and 3 Bags of Reagents.  <|text|> Master Ashton's going to probably need something bracing once we get him free. I know of a quick potion guaranteed to get anyone to snap out of it, but I'm going to need a few things first.

Those wicker dogs down there have some organic parts I can use and the witches are carrying bags of reagents. They'll almost certainly have what I need.

Bring those to me and I'll handle the rest once we get Master Ashton back.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Maruuk Centaur <|obj|> Complete 3 tortollan world quests.  <|text|> Assist the tortollan by completing 3 world quests.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Basilisk's Bite <|obj|> Bring ten Basilisk Brains and two Vulture Gizzards to Bloodmage Lynnore.  <|text|> These wastelands are riddled with redstone basilisk, <name>. These basilisk have adapted and flourished, more so than any of the other wildlife within the region. I have watched from afar as they hunt and go about their daily activities - the beasts exhibit a thought process more complex than even some humanoids. I must study their brains! Retrieve ten of their brains for me, <name>. The compound cannot be complete, however, without two vulture gizzards to form the base of the solution.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Untangling the Sigil <|obj|> Speak with Bolvar to discuss what to do with the sigil.  <|text|> The Primus 's sigil is bound together with the magic of memory. It reminds me of something you have encountered before.

You made an ally of the Runecarver, that poor soul trapped in the bowels of Torghast. He took those memories you found and helped you forge them into weapons and armor.

Perhaps he can separate the sigil from this tangle of memories.

It's our best chance to secure the sigil. But the way will be perilous.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tricks of the Trade <|obj|> Find and rouse the missing Trader.  <|text|> To pass the time, traders have been known to consume beverages of an inspired nature, if you know what I mean.

Sometimes, they drink a bit too much. Your trader might have stumbled beyond the gates and passed out under a tree. It's been known to happen from time to time.

Luckily, I have a brew that I use to rouse groggy traders. One splash and I find they're more willing to work.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Foxtails By The Handful <|obj|> Collect 7 Fluffy Fox Tails.  <|text|> We've seen more foxes in the hills lately. Cunning creatures, they are. A good test of a hunter's skills, and a fine profit to boot! It's their tails, <lad/lass>. Fine and fluffy, they're just as good hung on yer belt to ward off fleas as they are to line the gloves of some fancy noble. Listen to me prattle on. I'm no goblin; the thrill's in the hunt! But if you bring me back some foxtails, I'll still gladly pay you for 'em. You'll find the foxes just north of the lodge in the lower woodlands.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Shattered Path Through Time <|obj|> Defeat 5 Timewalking raid bosses or dungeons.  <|text|> I've been reading some books about this cataclysm that happened to Azeroth.

<|startoftext|> The Broken Crown <|obj|> Speak to Anduin Wrynn in the Geometric Cavern.  <|text|> Our friends have returned from the Sepulcher of the First Ones with a familiar face.

Anduin. . . What terrible things he has endured. 

But as difficult and painful as it is, we must uncover what he knows. The Jailer has blocked our way within the Sepulcher, and we risk falling victim to Domination ourselves if we blindly follow.

He is our best hope.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fibrous Thread <|obj|> Bring 1 Emerald Fiber from enchanted thickets in the Emerald Dream.  <|text|> Fine thread may conjure images of tailory, but it can serve a vital role in leatherwork as well.

Some of the Dream's hardier flora can be processed into a thread strong enough to secure even the thickest of hides and scales. If you happen upon any dense fiber during your travels, you would be well-served by bringing it to my colleague in the Dream.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> No Better Than the Zombies <|obj|> Report to Darnell at Deathknell in Tirisfal Glades.  <|text|> While you were inside that cave, your big friend Darnell came by with some alarming news. Since the val'kyr arrived, we've seen more and more undead that chose not to join our forces under the banner of the Dark Lady.  They've been gathering at a small camp here in the valley, and now they've organized forces. They plan to attack Deathknell, <class>. Darnell is just down the road, to the east.  Be careful, <name>.  While those undead aren't completely brainless, they're still not quite right in the head.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Small Comforts <|obj|> Find and return Meara's Dried Roses, Parlan's Ivory Hammer, and Aprika's Doll.  <|text|> You're the new face that's meant to be helping Keegan out I take it? Pleasure to meet you. Maybe you can lend a favor or two more to the troubled Wildhammer that have made refuge here. We were all forced to retreat to this building quickly, and some of us left behind things of great value in our destroyed homes nearby. Would you mind bringing them back after you go out there? You would bring happiness to some very troubled souls.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Search for Knowledge <|obj|> Look for ancient relics  on the shoreline of Azsuna.  <|text|> While you were out gallivanting, did you notice any lost relics around Azsuna? My sources tell me there are treasures to be found. These rumors merit investigation!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Homeward Bounding <|obj|> Chase the Lost Feathermane Kitten across the bridge and return it to its family.  <|text|> The first step to establishing a moonwell is to gain the blessings of the local wildlife. 

It is their good will that enables us to  peacefully coexist, and a moonwell thrives on such energies. Combined with Elune's light, a moonwell can purify its surroundings for years.

To begin, we must find creatures willing to give their blessing. We can start with these owl-cat creatures.

They ran while you cleaned, but I saw one lingering just before the bridge. 

See if you can find where it lives!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Ritual of Binding <|obj|> Speak with Kalandrios to begin the Ritual of Binding.  <|text|> The time has come for you to undertake the Ritual of Binding, <name>. This ancient, shamanic rite has been practiced since long before I was born. To be chosen is a great honor.

When you are ready, speak with Kalandrios to begin the rite.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tough Love <|obj|> Retrieve Korinna's Allaying Crook from Kala inside her den.  <|text|> Heavens! Kala has flown off with Korinna's Allaying Crook!

I saw her fly into her den to the west. I must warn you, she can become very protective when she's in there. Please be careful, but do not be afraid to give her some tough love. She is exceptionally resilient.

Here, take her slobber ball. It's her favorite and may help to distract her.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Pursuit of Justice <|obj|> Defeat Margrave Gharmal.  <|text|> Draka stands ready to unleash the power of the necropolis upon Gharmal. We need only buy her time to focus its weaponry.

What we do now, we do for all of us. Bastion and Maldraxxus have both lost much to these fiends.

Gharmal will not be defeated easily. . . but united, our forces will finally bring them to justice!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Get on the Horn <|obj|> Friend, the Shikaar have asked me to offer you their ritual hunting horns.  <|text|> Friend, the Shikaar have asked me to offer you their ritual hunting horns. They insisted the horns were only for you, and that I was not to use them. Hmph! I'm an excellent hunter. Perhaps the best they will ever see! They just don't know it yet. <Huseng laughs. >So here you are. My stock is open to you, should you want any others.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Centaur Bounty <|obj|> Bring 15 Centaur Ears to Corporal Melkins at Nijel's Point in Desolace.  <|text|> Many clans make up the centaur race.  Each has its own leader and agenda, but all the clans have one thing in common.  Cruelty. If we are to ever find peace, then the centaurs must be removed.  And so I put you on the task to do just that. While wandering Desolace, hunt centaur and take their ears.  Bring me many, many ears. Do this in service of the Alliance, <name>, and we will be one step closer to war's end.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> A Fall From Grace <|obj|> Agent Skully at New Hearthglen has asked you to ring the bell in the abbey and then go speak with the high abbot and get information out of him.  <|text|> We need more information from the high abbot, and now that we have the visage of one of the raven priests, I think we can get you close to talk with him. Unfortunately, we need to separate him from his bodyguards or you'll never get any information out of him. <The agent leans on her shovel and thinks a moment. >I think I've got it! While in disguise, go to the top of the abbey and ring the bell. That should bring the abbot's bodyguards running and you can then head down to speak with him.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Like a Fart in the Wind <|obj|> Recover 8 Redridge Supply Crates.  <|text|> We were raided last night, or perhaps it was the night before. I'm not really sure when it was as I haven't had a wink of sleep in three days. I'm probably delusional at this point. Listen, gnolls raided our supply stores and took off with everything! Just like a fart in the wind, they were in and they were OUT! My soldiers saw them running back towards the canyons, northwest of here. Recover our supplies, <class>!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Festival of Fire <|obj|> Touch the bonfires within Stormwind, Ironforge, and Darnassus, then speak to a Festival Loremaster within the capital cities.  <|text|> Midsummer is upon us once again! Each year, as tradition dictates, Flamekeepers are chosen to tend the bonfires within our capitals. While fires are burning throughout Azeroth, it is imperative that ours be the hottest and brightest, to properly pay homage to the season. In fact, I have a task for you, if you don't mind. I've not yet heard if the fires in all capitals are properly burning. Travel there yourself and warm yourself by the fires--make sure they're hot!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To Fel and Back <|obj|> Speak with Kyra Lightblade to secure a ride to Felwing Ledge.  <|text|> Mardum has its fair share of secrets, one of which we found not too long after we took control of the Fel Hammer. It's a breeding ground of sorts, festering with fel bats. We've been capturing the pups and trying to train them up for our efforts against the Legion. But the other day, we caught an even greater prize, something worthy of your position, Slayer. Speak with Kyra and she'll provide you a ride to the ledge.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> All or Nothing <|obj|> Assist Captain Taylor in the defense of The Briny Cutter.  <|text|> This is it. This is where we make our stand.

<|startoftext|> No Trespass Forgiven <|obj|> Kill 20 Kvaldir on the Vrykul Ledge.  <|text|> I know that you, like our revered lady, have unfortunate streaks of mercy that you succumb to at times. I would advise against such kindnesses this day. The Kvaldir are proud, and they will strike back if we do not cripple them completely. Kill all that you find. Sadly, I have the inglorious task of making sure none return to the city, so you can go have all of the fun. I will cheer you on though, of course.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Westbrook Garrison Needs Help!  <|obj|> Go to the Westbrook Garrison and speak with Deputy Rainer.  <|text|> The Garrison on our western border sends word of increasing gnoll and thief activity.  They're requesting we send more Stormwind soldiers. . . but we just don't have any to spare! If you can help, we could use it.  Go and speak with Deputy Rainer at the Westbrook Garrison and see what he needs done. The Garrison is down the road to the west.

<|startoftext|> Reach West <|obj|> Fly the race courses in the western Forbidden Reach.  <|text|> You and your drakes seem to enjoy your adventures in Forbidden Reach, don't you?

<|startoftext|> The Kirin Tor <|obj|> Use the Portal to the Purple Parlor in Lion's Landing and meet with Anduin Wrynn.  <|text|> $p, King Varian has asked that I send you after his son to Dalaran. He believes you can help negotiate the withdrawal of blood elves there. These "Sunreavers" claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort. Now that our very own Jaina Proudmoore is in charge of the Kirin Tor it should be easy to convince her to remove this Horde threat to her city. Use the portal here in Lion's Landing to go to the Purple Parlor and lend what aid you can to Prince Anduin.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To Greymane Manor <|obj|> Speak to Queen Mia Greymane inside Greymane Manor.  <|text|> It's time for everyone to head to safety.  That includes you, <name>.

Once you get there, speak to Queen Greymane about the gravity of the situation.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Welcome to the Jungle <|obj|> Speak with Hemet Nesingwary Jr.  <|text|> Welcome to Stranglethorn! Perhaps you're not aware of this, but that dwarf over there is the son of the one and only Hemet Nesingwary, renowned war hero of the Alliance and master big game hunter.  Like his father, he's not one for welcoming strangers into his camp, but you look like you've seen quite a bit of action in your day, <class>. Go and speak with him.  He's a chip off the old block, so perhaps he can give you some hunting pointers.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Assisting Arch Druid Runetotem <|obj|> Speak with Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem in Thunder Bluff.  <|text|> Excuse me <class>, but I'd like just a moment of your time if possible.

While I do not know the specifics, I can inform you that none other than Hamuul Runetotem is spearheading this research. Please - if you are interested, speak with him directly on the Elder Rise within Thunder Bluff proper.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Grateful Dead <|obj|> Acquire some Bread of the Dead and give it to the Cheerful Forsaken Spirit in Undercity's graveyard.  <|text|> It's good to visit with friends and family again, though I may have overdone it. . . I've already eaten everything they made for me! Might I trouble you for some more of that delicious Bread of the Dead? I'd be most grateful. . . Chapman there sells the recipe, I think.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Unfamiliar Waters <|obj|> Locate Herezegor Flametusk at the Wyvern's Tail inn within the Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar, and obtain a Twilight Highlands Coastal Chart.  <|text|> The Warchief has designs to launch an all-out assault on the Twilight Highlands. Once there we hope to ally with the Dragonmaw orcs. Through my own sources I've discovered that a Dragonmaw orc resides here, in Orgrimmar. He is known as Herezegor Flametusk, and once he commanded legions of their warriors. His insider knowledge is precious to us. Find Flametusk and obtain for us a chart of the Twilight Highlands waterways. Last I hear, Flametusk was washed up at a bar in the Valley of Honor. . .  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Tome of Divinity <|obj|> Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.  <|text|> In all things, a paladin must reflect the Light which supplements our strength. To strive to be divine for one of our kind does not mean we strive for godhood--we strive to be good in all actions. Although called upon to smite evil in these harsh times, you must always remember that it's aiding others that will truly set you apart from the citizens of Azeroth. Compassion, patience, bravery--these things mean as much to a paladin as strength in battle. Know this well, and never forget it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Are We There, Yeti?  <|obj|> Collect 10 Thick Yeti Furs for Umi Rumplesnicker in Everlook.  <|text|> My friends are always coming up with great ideas.

Save everyone you can. And find those black dragons!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Blackout <|obj|> Slay 8 Obsidian Pyrewings after using the Wyrmhunter Hooks to reach them.  <|text|> The Twilight Drakehunters used vicious implements to drag our circling drakes from the sky. Hooks that buried into their scales and held the Twilight secure while they brought our kin to the ground. We are past the point of peace. Past hope for their redemption. The only mercy we have left to offer the black flight is the oblivion that they so passionately pursue. Use these hooks to slay the Obsidian Pyrewings to the south. They should allow you much maneuverability in the air if used right.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The High Elder <|obj|> Speak with High Elder Cloudfall at the Tian Monastery in the Jade Forest.  <|text|> How strange, to have such a foreign-looking <class> visiting our temple.

<|startoftext|> Scouting Reports <|obj|> Interact with the Scouting Map and complete "Scouting Reports".  <|text|> In the recent past, our order has spent a lot of time watching and waiting.

I can see by the lessons you've learned that the time has come to send you back to Aelthalyste. There are things only she can teach you, and even then, only if you prove worthy. I will not spoil the surprise for you, but I remember when I was a young priest learning about true power. . . divine power. Yes, those were the days. Go back to Aelthalyste in the Undercity, <name>.

<|startoftext|> Enormous Anchor Pod <|obj|> Bring the Enormous Anchor Pod to Jahden Fla.  <|text|> In all the gathering you've done, you have never come across an anchor pod of this size. Whatever the reason that it has gotten so large, there is much that can be learned from it. Your mind wanders back to Jahden, and if there is anything about it in the book you picked up earlier.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To Catch A Sparrowhawk <|obj|> Use the Sparrowhawk Net to capture a Wild Sparrowhawk and bring it to Watcher Elaira on the Twilight Ridge.  <|text|> The wild sparrowhawks of Nagrand have the keenest sight of all the predatory birds here. But, because of their size, they've been pushed out of most areas by the larger windrocs. Most of the sparrowhawks nest here, on the Twilight Ridge. If you can catch one, I'll train it to spot the pieces of your buried tablet. It's going to be difficult, though. The sparrowhawks are very skittish and will flee at your approach. I'd suggest cornering one or prowling to get close enough to cast your net.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Engraved Ring <|obj|> Bring Deliah's Ring to Magistrate Sevren in Brill.  <|text|> If you want to find the husband or beloved who gave Deliah her ring. . . then speak with Magistrate Sevren in Brill.  He should have records of recent deaths and, with luck, can discover who Deliah is. But I wouldn't hope.  Whoever gave her the ring is probably dead.  Or if he's undead he probably no longer cares about Deliah.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Anthion's Parting Words <|obj|> Return to Deliana in Ironforge with a set of Lightforge Boots, Lightforge Legplates and Lightforge Spaulders.  <|text|> Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet.  In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us. The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the medallion back together.  Return to Deliana and tell her that Bodley is her only hope for finding the remaining pieces.  Speak to her about any rewards you've arranged for. I, for once, shall rest in peace.  I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it!  <|endoftext|>

Here I was, thinking that we're friends now and yet you neglected to tell me about your magnificient wrench!

Well, not too magnificient. . . I recognize the Ub3r-Spanner from its blueprints, but whoever built this lacks a certain level of craftsmanship.

No excuses. I will fix your mistakes.  <|endoftext|>

That is what the young rely on these days: luck. . . and the generosity of those more powerful than they. Not many take the time to find their own path. It's always begging for help. . . always the reward, and never the quest. I'm sure you'll be the same. But there is hope. I need one other thing for my potion, <name>: 8 shimmerweed herbs. They can be found in Thunder Ridge to the northwest of Razor Hill.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bloodpetal Poison <|obj|> Collect 8 Bloodcap and 8 Gorishi Stings, and return to Torwa Pathfinder in Un'Goro Crater.  <|text|> I would ask you to help me create a toxin of sorts, to pacify a great creature living here in the crater.

<|startoftext|> Explore Torghast <|obj|> Explore Torghast for clues to locate your allies.  <|text|> Baine is safe, but our other allies are still prisoners of the Jailer. They remain in grave peril.

<|startoftext|> Human Infestation <|obj|> Capture 8 Hillsbrad Humans.  <|text|> This mine was once the heart of Alliance mining operations in Hillsbrad.

<|startoftext|> Ephemeral Manastorm Projector <|obj|> Collect 4 Warp-Resistant Plating from Chronarch Defenders.  <|text|> Oculeth's theory is sound. Reckless, but sound.

A small warp-field could trap and excite ambient mana in the conduit, thus creating a manastorm similar to when the arcan'dor fell out of balance.

I can build a device to generate the warp-field, but I need materials.

Specifically, warp-resistant alloys - such as the armor plating of high-end security constructs in the noble district.

Those constructs are deadly. If anyone owes you a favor, now is the time to call it in.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Checking on the Boys <|obj|> Travel to the Wetlands and speak to Mountaineer Rharen near Dun Algaz.  <|text|> I'm sure you've seen just how bad the damage to the Loch is by now. The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands. There's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands. I haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them?  <|endoftext|>

The self proclaimed "Lord of Rhinos" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - rhinos unable to defend themselves against Ned's cowardly attacks.

We should not take any chances. Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, carve up the remains of the vrykul that we slay. I spent the morning sharpening it, so it should cleave even through their thick bones.  <|endoftext|>

And keep them safe! I cannot afford to lose any more!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Circle the Wagon <|obj|> Find Maraad and the lost laborers and escort them back to Elodor Fields.  <|text|> One of our wagons fell behind, and disappeared somewhere in the woods to the northwest.

You must defend it, and us, from those forces above that the gronn used to protect us from: ethereals, demons, and worst of all, the black dragonflight. When you find ogre heaven, seek out the wisdom of Chu'a'lor on how best to proceed.  <|endoftext|>

One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at Razaan's Landing, north of the Razor Ridge.

<|startoftext|> Pelt Collection <|obj|> Velan Brightoak at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods wants you to bring him 6 Springpaw Pelts.  <|text|> The springpaw that inhabit this region are known for their high quality pelts.  We've even seen night elf scum travel to these lands just to poach them.

Since you've been helpful so far, I'll do you the honor of letting you test out some authentic Uktulut weaponry. You'll find no sharper blade or sturdier haft this side of the Dragon Isles.

There's a section of the Flamebender's Tome that speaks about a "sacrifice, " and a more recent notation referring to "the chieftain. " I think it's talking about Warlord Blackhand. Did Blackhand sacrifice someone? Himself? A piece of himself? Is that why his hand is deformed? Before I risk channeling these elements into a spell, I need to know. And there's only one way to find out. Kill Warlord Blackhand. And bring me his severed arm.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Warchief Commands <|obj|> Find Saurfang in the Northern Barrens.  <|text|> Silithus. That has been the name of the game. . . or rather, that is what I wanted the Alliance to believe.

<|startoftext|> Zukk'ash Infestation <|obj|> Bring 20 Zukk'ash Carapaces to Hadoken Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas.  <|text|> From what scouting we have managed to muster, we believe that the foe south of the gnolls is an insect-like race.  Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not if they're sentient.  If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls. Drive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.  Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork.  <|endoftext|>

And one of the giants, Gorlash, stole my Captain's Chest.  He said he wanted it for a snuffbox.  The nerve! I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here.  Find him and get back my chest!

If the vrykul here are as skilled as the ones in Northrend, then I'm certain we can learn something by studying their armaments.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Imp Mother's Tome <|obj|> Obtain the Tome of Fel Secrets.  <|text|> See this giant cave? There's a terrifyingly powerful imp mother inside.

But that's not the good part. The good part is what she has.

Apparently, she's some kind of keeper of fel secrets. She's in there performing profane Legion rites and scribing them into a book.

We need that power! We need her tome!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Rise of Aku'mai <|obj|> Kill Aku'mai the Devourer.  <|text|> We barely escaped the Twilight's Hammer sacrificial altar, but there are others who need help deeper within these caves.

<|startoftext|> Anima Reclamation <|obj|> Reclaim 8 Devoured Anima from devourers at the Sanctuary of Guidance.  <|text|> Our efforts here need a constant supply of troops, supplies, and anima. The last one is the hardest, for obvious reasons. But I've learned to be resourceful. 

Nearby there is a plentiful source of anima: the devourers that currently swarm the Sanctuary of Guidance. It's not as easy as beating it out of a soul, but it's just as effective, if you're strong enough. Are you?  <|endoftext|>

It is called the Burning Blade Medallion, and your next task is to find it and remove it from the coven. But be wary, for the medallion may be possessed by an agent of the Burning Blade, and if so then the agent's power would be greater than the familiars you have already encountered. Go, <name>.  You will find the coven in a cave, to the north and west.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Source Revealed <|obj|> Find Apothecary Staffron Lerent in the Hillsbrad Foothills behind Ravenholdt Manor.  <|text|> What? Treason? No, no.

And to prove that I mean no harm, I will even tell you my source. They were shipped to me by a Staffron Lerent, an apothecary of some sort. I never spoke with him.

It gets quite lonely out here, you know, even with Wenna to keep me company. . . a pet's just what I need to brighten my spirits. A little baby raptor would be the best! If you're out there slaughtering the adults, would you mind bringing me back some mature eggs? You can tell if they're ready to hatch by the wobbling.  <|endoftext|>

I was investigating why they appeared when I was locked out of the tomb. Perhaps your mission awakened them.

Should we intend to venture forth, we must disarm the new defenses. The glowing orbs flanking the doors might be the key. If only they weren't damaged. . .  <|endoftext|>

I'm not an expert at this just yet, so I'm going to need my manual.  The problem is, I left it at the workshop. . . which happens to be that burning building next to the mine.  Think you could go salvage it?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rhino Mastery: The Kill <|obj|> Bring Farunn's Horn to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Base Camp.  <|text|> Now that we know where to find Farunn, all that remains is the battle against the great beast.

<|startoftext|> Repair and Restore <|obj|> Repair the Broken Mirror and reap the rewards.  <|text|> You've already attuned several mirrors without incident. I do believe it's time you try your hand at repairing them instead.

It's quite easy once you've found the fragments, but there are a few things of note to keep in mind. 

Repaired mirrors are fragile and unpredictable. They often break with a single use, and it's never a guarantee that using one will translocate you somewhere safe. 

Here's a few shards to get you started. 

Restore the mirror to working order and see where it leads.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Druidic Fur <|obj|> Bring the fur to Loganaar in Moonglade.  <|text|> <This fur teems with natural magic. The beasts you fought on the island were clearly not beasts at all, but druids.

At least they were before.

What could have caused them to become feral?

You did not want to slay them, but they gave you no choice, didn't they? > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Handle With Care <|obj|> Recover 6 Packed Explosive Charges.  <|text|> We can help you get your ship free, but we'll need more of the explosives we were trying to take back from the Alliance to make it happen. I ordered the men to grab all the explosives they could before making our escape.

<|startoftext|> Wander Not Alone <|obj|> Speak to Torcali.  <|text|> She is here. I can feel her eyes upon us.

Great Wanderer guide your path, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Scarlet Commander <|obj|> Slay High Commander Goodchilde.  <|text|> There is only one more obstacle standing between us and the tomb of Sally Whitemane. High Commander Goodchilde guards the path to the tomb. Although he is a zealot and a murderer, he is still a hardened knight who has dedicated his life to the eradication of our kind.

<|startoftext|> Get Our Stuff Back!  <|obj|> Retrieve 8 Crates of Tools.  <|text|> Our bombs and tools! Those sneaky monkeys to the east stole them all in the dead of night!

My brother had a genius plan.  He saw those murlocs luring fish out of the reeds with a phosphorescent antenna, and devised a way to make one of his own.  All ya need is something that glows. Kill the crabs and groupers that roam the canyon's floor.  They aren't edible themselves, but their phosphora is far more valuable than their meat.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Warfront: The Battle for Darkshore <|obj|> Defeat the Alliance at the Battle for Darkshore.  <|text|> Darkshore belongs to the Horde! We must hold that ground to maintain our dominance over Kalimdor.

I sent out my top assistant, Junior Surveyor Scrimshank, into the desert southeast of here.  That's an area we call the Gaping Chasm.  Well, he's gone missing, and his last report had more of those weird bugs where he was.  Could it be that they've infested two major regions of the desert now? I need you to head into the Gaping Chasm and look for Scrimshank, please!  That. . . or at least find his surveying equipment.  I fear that may be all that is left of the poor sod.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Missing Expedition <|obj|> Kill 8 Myst Spinners, 8 Myst Leechers and their leader, Zarakh.  <|text|> About a week ago, my research team and I were out exploring the western wilds of Bloodmyst when we were attacked by bloodthirsty spiders. The effect of the crystal contamination was clearly evident as these spiders were massive and extremely aggressive. I managed to escape but my team wasn't so lucky. We must not let the same fate befall others. Go west to the Amberweb Pass and destroy the spiders and their matriarch, Zarakh.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Snailed It <|obj|> Introduce yourself to Slick.  <|text|> Hmm. You ever mount a snail before?

I've trained generations of racing snail champions, but lately I've come across my toughest case yet. Simply put, he's too crokin' big. Straight up barred from competition.

<|startoftext|> Balance in All Things <|obj|> Speak to Ulfar and cleanse the Filled Drust Vessel.  <|text|> The confluence of energies around that vessel is truly disturbing. My skin crawls with the wrongness of it.

They should be told of what happened here. If you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone north. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Eye of Shadra <|obj|> Recover the Eye of Shadra from Agol'watha.  <|text|> Shadra must be summoned, for certain. To allow an opportunity like this to pass us by would be foolish. While the apothecaries can make fine use of the god's venom, they are relatively inexperienced in ritual magic. Fortunately, I am quite familiar with preparing dark convocations. You will bring the scattered parts of Shadra to me, and I will help you bring her to this plane to be taken out. The first part is the eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Did You Lose This?  <|obj|> Wait for Trenton to finish his work.  <|text|> You have done much for the Order, <name>. The sheer dedication it takes to get this far would have turned away any ordinary person. There is no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of Galvan, that you are one of us. Which is why I think you deserve a little reward. It is nothing really, just a trinket. You may be familiar with its properties, as I do believe it is what brought you to us in the first place.  <|endoftext|>

My grandson, Mac, was such a good boy.  A mere 14 years old.  When the army was sent off to the front, Mac took up arms to defend the city.  He was a guard in The Stockade, where the Defias gang is locked up.  Mac reprimanded some of the prisoners for tearing their wool blankets to make scarves, a symbol of their gang.  For that Mac was stabbed in the back. I want revenge.  Bring me 10 of their precious Wool Bandanas.  They are the color of blood.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Lay Them to Rest <|obj|> Use the Branch of the Runewood to send 8 weakened Restless Ancestors back to the earth.  <|text|> I would ask a favor, outsider.

As you step through the graves of ancient heroes, you will no doubt come across spirits of the restless dead, agitated by the Bonespeakers misdeeds. They must be returned to the earth where they are buried, so that they may be judged as well.

Take this bough - it carries with it the essence of the Runewood. Channel its power into a weakened spirit, and it will return to rest.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Escape from Silverbrook <|obj|> Open the Wooden Cage and help the Freed Alliance Scout escape from Silverbrook.  <|text|> You. . . you're not one of them?  Quick!  Let me out!

<|startoftext|> The Fall of the Warlord <|obj|> Kill Warlord Bult.  <|text|> You've managed to survive this long, stranger. All that remains to be done here is to fell the Warlord of the arena. This will be your first true test here. Bult would provide a challenge to even a battle-hardened Frostwolf. Place the heads you've collected on spikes in the Frostfire Arena. They are sure to enrage the warlord and lure him into battle. Come out of the arena victorious and it will show that Durotan's trust in you was not misplaced.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Undercover Agent: Nugg Lumbo <|obj|> Report to Nugg Lumbo aboard the Skybag, the zeppelin above Brawl'gar Arena.  <|text|> I've got one more suspect I'm investigating: Libbiara Blightrunner.

Over to the northeast, you'll find Engineer Grindspark, one of a new generation of brilliant gnomish minds. Why, he hasn't had an explosion in over three prototypes! But enough bragging. Engineer Grindspark is working on a bot that he says will help clean up the toxic airfield. You should introduce yourself to him and see if he needs any help testing it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cure For All Ills <|obj|> Use Roseboil's Regenerative Molt to cure 15 Plague-ridden Survivors.  <|text|> Many survivors from the House of Plagues are still in need help. Their suffering fills me with great sadness.

Please, help me cure them!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Trial by Magma <|obj|> Speak with Wyrtle Spreelthonket and ask him to release Magma Lord Kolob.  <|text|> I suppose I'll make the most of this situation.  These goblin mercenaries brought this enormous fire elemental to my stronghold as a "thank you" for hiring them.  What am I going to do with an elemental here in the steppes?  That's like bringing sand to the beach. If you're looking for work, then prove yourself.  Talk to this goblin here, and challenge his elemental to a fight.  The victor earns my respect, and my time.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cracking the Curse <|obj|> Destroy the 4 Lesser Effigies in the Shrouded Foothills.  <|text|> <In her haste, it looks like Helena left her spellbook behind. The pages of this book detail the ritual that she used to entrap the villagers of Fallhaven. 

It seems the effigy holding the spell in the village is protected by smaller ones surrounding the town. If these are destroyed, you may be able to affect the one holding the spell on the townsfolk. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Prove Yer Allegiance <|obj|> Kill 10 Dark Iron dwarves in the Ruins of Thaurissan.  <|text|> Yer welcome to stay in Chiselgrip for a time, but I need to know that yer a friend.  So I've got a task for ye. We of the Thorium Brotherhood're not the only dark irons here in the steppes.  Far from it.  We're pretty badly outnumbered by the dark irons of Blackrock Mountain.  We've got a safe enough foothold here in Chiselgrip, but even so, they still pester us from as close as the Ruins of Thaurissan, to the north. Prove yerself, <race>.  Kill 'em for me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Umbrafen Eel Filets <|obj|> Noraani at Telredor wants you to bring her 8 Eel Filets.  <|text|> It's good to see another fresh face here. When Haalrun and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago. Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor anchorites, but we can follow their example and extend it to others. If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the Umbrafen eel, whose meat is a staple of our diet.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Defusing the Threat <|obj|> Find the Frostwolf Explosives Expert and kill him.  <|text|> The Frostwolf have their front lines and bases booby trapped, <class>. You have to watch your step when invading enemy territory. If you want to make a solid strike against them, you must destroy their source of anti personnel munitions - I'm talking about their explosives expert. If you kill him, you are safe to disarm the mines. As long as he is kept down, the mines will also stay down. You will probably find him in a tower near the Iceblood Garrison. Good luck!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cyphers of the First Ones <|obj|> Investigate the Cypher Console.  <|text|> The way is not quite clear, but the first steps have been made.

It seems the divine construct has taken more of a liking to you than to me. 

Now that it has given you the beginnings of understanding, see what else it wishes to show you.

The results should be enlightening.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Phantom Potion <|obj|> Bring Tyra Silverblood 10 Ghost Truffles.  <|text|> Every turn you take in Ashran you run into danger.

<|startoftext|> The Art of Persuasion <|obj|> Librarian Normantis on Amber Ledge wants you to use the Neural Needler on the Imprisoned Beryl Sorcerer until he reveals the location of Lady Evanor.  <|text|> It is fortunate you're here, <race>. You see, the Kirin Tor code of conduct frowns upon our taking certain 'extreme' measures - even in desperate times such as these. You, however, as an outsider, are not bound by such restrictions and could take any steps necessary in the retrieval of information. Do what you must. We need to know where Lady Evanor is being held at once! I'll just busy myself organizing these shelves here. Oh, and here, perhaps you'll find this old thing useful. . . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Chasing Hope <|obj|> Touch 3 Spirits of the Crane.  <|text|> Chi-Ji is always with us.

Find and catch the spirits of the crane.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Den <|obj|> Travel to the Den on Stonetalon Peak.  <|text|> The druids built the Talon Den on Stonetalon Peak, where they keep many powerful items.

Hidden in a small lantern at the entrance of the Den, you will find the Gatekeeper's Key --with it you will be able to open caches around the Den. The items from these caches will allow you to open their hoard, located in one of the central areas.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Druid's Form <|obj|> Commune with the nearby druid stone.  <|text|> Thank you for rescuing me, <name>. Allow me to aid you in your druidic studies.

To escape from the pit, I took on the form of a stag. I may know of a way you can learn to do the same.

Come with me. There is an ancient druid stone nearby. Let us use it to commune with the wilds.  <|endoftext|>

Rumor has it she was exiled to Vol'dun.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Overgrown Story <|obj|> Gaiagantic and 12 Geomentals examined for research data.  <|text|> Since our arrival here the Untamed Verdure has been a mystery waiting to be solved. The lush foliage of the area grows on everything as the creatures run amok without purpose.

There could be valuable research data to be obtained from these creatures.

Use a Containment Trap to subdue the elemental creatures. Once subdued, examine them for research data.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Blood of Innocents <|obj|> Bring 5 Vials of Innocent Blood to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.  <|text|> I will create a toxin to bleed the violence from the Venture Company, rendering them weak and docile.  That should fix the Horde's problem in Stonetalon, yes? But to create the toxin, I will need the blood of innocents, a difficult ingredient to obtain. Fortunately the Syndicate, a group of human brigands in this area, employ shadow mages. . . and those mages collect innocent blood for their own, unsavory purposes. You can find the Syndicate shadow mages in Durnholde Keep to the southeast.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hot On The Trail <|obj|> Look for Snivel Rustrocket in the Orgrimmar Bank, the Auction House, and the Barbershop in Orgrimmar.  <|text|> I'd better start from the beginning. It was love at first sight, <name>. There was just something about that goblin from the moment I set eyes on him. After a wonderful week together, Snivel said he had come into a lot of money and that he was going to take me on a long vacation to the South Seas! Can you believe it? Anyway, he told me to pack while he ran some errands to the bank, the auction house, and the barber shop, but he never came back! I'm beginning to think he's nothing but a big liar!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Broken Alliances <|obj|> Kill Boss Tho'grun and bring the Sign of the Earth to Gorn in Kargath.  <|text|> From the Horde's alliance with the dragon Deathwing during the Second War, we know that two of his lieutenants, Blacklash and Hematus, were imprisoned within Lethlor Ravine far to the east. We must silence our depraved allies of old to restore honor to the Horde! We hired Tho'grun and his band of ogre mercenaries to help us obtain the Sign of the Earth, a key needed to unlock the drakes' prison. Tho'grun betrayed us though, overwhelming us and taking it for himself. Go to Camp Boff and take it back!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Funding a Treasure Hunt <|obj|> Buy the Archeologist Artifact Notes from Cataloger Jakes.  <|text|> < Cataloger Jakes quickly flips through her own supply bag and pulls out a freshly drawn map. >

One of our archeologists just reported some new findings in regards to a lost artifact, suspected to be in this area.

<|startoftext|> A Worthy Weapon <|obj|> Bring the Blade of Drak'Mar to Arcanist Taelis at the Argent Tournament Grounds.  <|text|> Our champions have taken a liking to ancient weapons produced here in Northrend. I've heard the bards telling tales of travelers offering winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to the circle of lamps in Drak'Mar Lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills. Ask the lonely maiden for a worthy blade.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Primalist Directive <|obj|> Convince 5 of Terro's Primalists to side with Vyranoth.  <|text|> Terro was another one of Vyranoth's claws. He never wanted to attack the Dream, and some of the Primalists who served him may feel the same. See if you can convince them to join our side. 

I can put a mark of Vyranoth on you so Terro's troops will not attack you. . . right away.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mending the Filter <|obj|> Try to find the whereabouts of a tailor in Val'sharah who can help you mend the silk.  <|text|> Bringing back the cloth in such a manner would not be beneficial to Deucus. Perhaps there's a tailor here in Val'sharah who'd be willing to mend it for you. The priestess who helped you earlier may know of such a person.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Mysterious Satchel <|obj|> Find the satchel's owner.  <|text|> An empty satchel with an old, magical aura. It appears quite dilapidated, with remnants of herbs and mushrooms along the inner lining. Perhaps exploring Umbrafen will offer a clue.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Guardians of the Altar <|obj|> Protect Ranshalla while she attempts to reactivate the Altar of Elune.  <|text|> At the very top of the ridge lies what I believe to be an altar of the goddess Elune. From what I can tell, we need to light the five torches in each cave, and then we will be able to access the altar directly. I transcribed some incantations carved into the stone in the ancient ruins of Kel'Theril, which I believe are the secret to unlocking the altar. I'll need your help to light each torch, while I recite the spell. If we are successful, you'll be able to report our findings to Erelas!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Stars of Elune <|obj|> You've proven yourself worthy of Elune's attention, &lt; name&gt; .  <|text|> You've proven yourself worthy of Elune's attention, <name>. If you feel you're ready, I would very much like to teach you one of her spells unique to our people.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Chasing the Wind <|obj|> Listen to Scout Tomul's report.  <|text|> We must take a moment to pause and consider our strategy. 

We need Ohn'ahra's blessing to sound the Horn of Drusahl and summon the green dragons. Without their aid, we cannot win this war. The Nokhud already outnumber the other clans, and their forces are bolstered by the Primalists. And now Koroleth has captured our Windmother! We must therefore find Ohn'ahra before the Nokhud can launch their final attack and encircle Maruukai.

I will send all of our scouts. I only hope we can find her in time.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Ub3r-Spanner <|obj|> Wait for Shuga Blastcaps to decode the schematic.  <|text|> It's a shame that Gryzix had to die. Those Venture Co. make all of us enterprising types look bad!

At least we can still decode the Ub3r-Spanner schematic. Here, hand me that schematic and his decoder and I'll get this whipped up in just a second.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Worthy Weapon <|obj|> Bring the Blade of Drak'Mar to Eressea Dawnsinger at the Argent Tournament Grounds.  <|text|> Of all the times to have such rotten luck! My tournament blade has gone missing. I've heard the bards telling tales of travelers offering winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to the circle of lamps in Drak'Mar Lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills. Ask the lonely maiden for a worthy blade.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Loramus, Is That You?  <|obj|> Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, "Loramus, Is That You? ".  <|text|> Belath Dawnblade has given us a strange scouting report from the Felblaze Ingress in Azsuna. The dreadlord, Razelikh the Defiler has returned to the world. That's not the odd part, though.

Strangely, he's sometimes going around killing the other demons and calling himself, Loramus!

Last we knew, our demon hunter brother, Loramus Thalipedes sacrificed himself to defeat Razelikh, whom he'd been possessed by.

Your champions and Ashtongue warriors need to go to Azsuna and find out what is going on.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Detonation <|obj|> Blow up Render's Valley.  <|text|> Those explosives you planted were high yield, <name>. When I push this button on the Bravo Company field kit, that whole valley is gonna be consumed by a massive fireball of death. You know, I think you should do the honors. You did all the hard work, after all. Ready?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Leather of the Ancients <|obj|> Obtain 100 pieces of Ancient Dreadleather from humanoids in Broken Shore.  <|text|> <name>, we are going to need high quality leather to work with. Ancient Dreadleather is the best hereabouts and local tanning techniques were exceptional in the past. To the untrained eye, it may look like normal dreadleather. That is where the wisp comes in. Many of your enemies across Broken Shore will have some amount of Ancient Dreadleather.  As you defeat them, you will start to recognize armor made from it and you can harvest the leather for our purposes.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Target: Writhing Haunt <|obj|> Go to the Writhing Haunt in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there, and use its key to gain access to the cauldron.  <|text|> Two cauldrons have been successfully opened; while you will be able to access them indefinitely, we still want to open up the other two that remain.  This will provide all of us with more options to introduce the counter agent! This time, you'll be hitting the Writhing Haunt's cauldron.  It is almost due east of Andorhal, relatively close to the ruined city walls; again, eliminate the cauldron lord present there for its key.  Use this bottle to obtain the sample from the cauldron. Good hunting, <name>!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hatecrest Forces <|obj|> Kill 10 Hatecrest Naga.  <|text|> The Hatecrest are fighting fiercely! Their leader is a priority, but we need to kill as many of them as we can. Go ahead of me, I'll meet you on the battlefield. Show them no mercy!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Admiral <|obj|> Kill Admiral Ripsnarl.  <|text|> <Bzzzzzzzzzzzzt. >I can't believe it. . . they're almost done rebuilding it! We don't have much time, <name>. Admiral Ripsnarl, Vanessa's right hand man, is bound to be on board. We'll never get to her if he's still alive to do anything about it. You're going to need to scale the unfinished Juggernaut, find Ripsnarl, and kill him so we can get to Vanessa's private quarters on the top deck. Be careful, the Admiral bears the worgen curse and would take much pleasure in digging his claws into you!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Curious Discovery <|obj|> Bring the Enchanting Crystal to Instructor Okanu in Mezzamere.  <|text|> <This crystal shines with a mesmerizing light that you find difficult to avert your gaze from. Perhaps the Ankoan would be able to tell you more about it. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Return the Book <|obj|> Return Gunther's Spellbook to him, on the island of Gunther's Retreat.  <|text|> Long ago Gunther and I, along with the now Scourge Necromancer Thule Ravenclaw, were friends and students within the Kirin Tor - a society of mages in Dalaran. Gunther and I both fell to the Plague, but I thought he either remained dead, or was raised into the ranks of the Lich King.  It is good to know he is free. We must have him.  I have placed a spell on his book that, when he sees it, will show him that I too am free of the Lich King.  After knowing this, it is my hope that he will join us.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wipe That Grin Off His Face <|obj|> Kill Foreman Swindlegrin and Meatpie and return to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp.  <|text|> We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and  isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight. The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig. Remember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Might of the Krom'gar <|obj|> You may now make use of the Krom'gar stockpile, &lt; name&gt; ! For a small fee I will sell you armaments of battle, useful for crushing your enemies!

Help us before our clan is lost!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Harpy Raiders <|obj|> Collect 6 Witchwing Talons from Witchwing harpies.  <|text|> Since you're here, <class>, perhaps you can help me with a small problem. The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers. The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top. Take out Witchwing harpies of any kind in the Northwest and bring me 6 Witchwing Talons. That should be a good start. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Path of Glory <|obj|> Cleanse 8 Trampled Skeletons on the Path of Glory with Draenei Holy Water, then return to Warp-Scryer Kryv at Honor Hold.  <|text|> The 'Path of Glory, ' they called it. A road leading from the heart of their gruesome fortress to the Dark Portal, paved with the bones of my people. It wasn't enough for them to hunt us down like animals, destroy our cities, and torture those who survived. No, they had to use our bones as paving stones, denying my brethren a proper burial under the Light. Those tortured souls still wander these lands, crying out for release. I ask you, <name>, help me in this undertaking.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Paragon of the Wardens <|obj|> Speak with Marin Bladewing in Azsuna.  <|text|> The impressed Wardens have requested your presence. They wish to reward you for your exceptional aid.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wormthorn's Dream <|obj|> Kill 5 Doomguard Destroyers, 5 Dreadlord Defilers, 5 Corrupted Darkwood Treants, and 3 Felspore Bog Lords in the Tainted Forest.  <|text|> Not surprisingly, most of our citizens in Surwich did not come to the Blasted Lands for the pleasant atmosphere.  They came following the dream of an idealistic druid: Marl Wormthorn.  Wormthorn believed that the Tainted Scar could be healed, and attempted to grow it back. It looks like he was wrong.  He grew his forest, but the land is still plagued by demons, and his great-tree is twisted and gnarled. I'm still hopeful.  Maybe if we head into the Tainted Forest and clear out some of the taint. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Down with the Quilboar <|obj|> Slay Geolord Grek'og.  <|text|> I have discovered that the quilboar are performing a necromantic ritual on a survivor from the missing expedition.

The ritual is being performed by the tribe's leader, Geolord Grek'og. 

Slay Grek'og and save the survivor.

Show this brute that the Horde is not to be trifled with.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dragonflayer Battle Plans <|obj|> Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port in the Howling Fjord has asked that you bring him the Dragonflayer Battle Plans.  <|text|> While we were able to gather very little information as to the whereabouts of Ingvar, we do know that Yanis resides in a cave next to the worg pit inside Wyrmskull Village. Intelligence gathered from the rescued soldiers indicates that Yanis guards Dragonflayer battle plans. I need you to go back to Wyrmskull and recover those plans. Kill any vrykul that get in your way - including Yanis!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Venom to the Undercity <|obj|> Bring Faranell's Parcel to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.  <|text|> The venom you gathered from the Witherbark's spider god is quite a find!  I've been able to kill nearly two dozen rabbits with just a drop of the stuff.  Granted, some of those rabbits were very young and small enough to fit in the palm of one's hand so I'm certain their resistance to toxins was low, but it can't be denied that this poison is powerful! I'd like a sample sent to my superior, Apothecary Faranell in the Apothecarium of the Undercity.  I am positive he would want to test this himself.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Cultist's Misgivings <|obj|> Locate Ayasanth in Smoldering Perch.  <|text|> Another outsider arrived yesterday. She called herself an "emissary" for the red dragonflight and asked for an audience with our leader, the Voice of Neltharion. 

But the Voice got terribly mad. He said that the Earth-Warder was testing us, and that we had to execute her!

I know we're not supposed to trust outsiders, but we don't have to kill them! Please, help me save her.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Elemental Goo <|obj|> Collect 10 Elemental Goo from any Cataclysm elemental and bring them to Isabel Jones in Stormwind City.  <|text|> Instead of using the tired old method of setting gems into rings and such, I use an innovative new method.  I simply glue on the gems with Barnsworth Elemental Glue!  The professor needs more elemental goo for another batch, though, and I have a whole bunch of setting to do.  Can you go get me some?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Out of This World Produce!  <|obj|> Bring the Preserved Fruit to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.  <|text|> I'll be the first to admit I'm not quite sure what this order is for, but Rocket-Chief Fuselage 's instructions were very specific -- only the very best fruit, preserved to survive a long voyage and sealed against the elements. There were other specifications, zero-gravity this and low pressure that. I don't pretend to understand it, but the price is right, so he'll get his superfood. Bring this crate to him up at Area 52. After crossing into Netherstorm, keep following the road until you see the town.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Thadius Grimshade <|obj|> Bring Sharpbeak's Feather to Thadius Grimshade in the Blasted Lands.  <|text|> Take this feather to Thadius Grimshade, the diviner.  He left Aerie Peak years ago to pursue darker knowledge, but in his heart he is still a Wildhammer! And perhaps his talents can help us find Sharpbeak. This feather was taken from the nest where the gryphon child sleeps.  If you give it to Thadius then, with luck, he can use his divining magics to find Sharpbeak. Good luck, <name>.  You will find Thadius in the Blasted Lands, in the mage tower of Nethergarde Keep.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Hunt Continues <|obj|> Grull Hawkwind in Camp Narache wants you to bring him 10 Mountain Cougar Pelts.  <|text|> A tauren skilled in the ways of the hunt knows that his prey is not for mere trophy. The beasts of the plains provide us with a means of survival. You will make quite an impression on the elders if you can bring back some highly valued Mountain Cougar Pelts. You can find the beasts lurking in the hills to the south. Our children need clothing and our tents need mending.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Survival of the Fattest <|obj|> Obtain 6 pieces of Dustbelcher Meat and 10 sheets of Dustbelcher Silk.  <|text|> We're hard-up for supplies, stranger.  With the black dragons raining destruction on our hunting grounds, we have no way to get food. The ogres to our south, however, have exactly what we need.  Within their grotto you should find plenty of meat and crafting supplies. They may put up a fight.  Be on your guard.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Dark that Blinds Us <|obj|> Take chalk rubbings of the northern, eastern, western, and southern Tribal Stones in the Whispering Fields.  <|text|> After years of research, there is still so much I do not understand about the Shadowmoon. To the southwest are stone monuments detailing the orcs' history. I'm not able to get close enough to examine the stones, but perhaps you can. If you could take a chalk rubbing of the words written on those stones, and I will reward you handsomely.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dance for Ruumbo!  <|obj|> Do a silly dance for Ruumbo.  <|text|> You have done well, <race>! Ruumbo is pleased by your bravery, and the delicious honey you have given Ruumbo. Now, you must. . . you must dance! Yes! Dance for Ruumbo! Dance!  <|endoftext|>

One of my best demon hunters, Zaria Shadowheart, is currently gathering intel on the demons in Felblaze Ingress. Go to her. She will teach you what she has learned from the demons invading that region.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trouble at Auchindoun <|obj|> Report to Field Commander Mahfuun at the entrance to the Shadow Labyrinth at Auchindoun in Terokkar Forest.  <|text|> I have spies within Auchindoun and they have been sending me disturbing reports.  That place has been nothing but trouble ever since it exploded a couple of years ago. Something in there has gone horribly wrong - again - and the Shadow Council is now on a war footing.  Though the reports were lacking on details, their preparations appear to be directed inward. You must make your way to the entrance of the Shadow Labyrinth.  My field commander, Mahfuun, will fill you in on what needs to be done.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Shipwrecked Captive <|obj|> Defeat Shipwrecked Captive in a pet battle.  <|text|> I spent my life playing the pet in other peoples battles. Now it's my time to be the pet tamer! Best part of being dead is I can do this forever!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Aged to Perfection <|obj|> Deliver the Hundred Year Bourbon to Carentan in Freehold.  <|text|> Greetings, young one. I am Roko. I trade in specialty goods and exotic wares.

< Roko pulls a small wooden cask from beneath his shell. >

This bourbon is one hundred years old. I know, because I bought it one hundred years ago.

A man in Freehold is prepared to trade me a rare scroll for this, but alas I am barred from entering. It seems this town is not so "free" anymore.

If you can get in, perhaps you could make the trade on my behalf? I would be in your debt.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Walking in Shadows <|obj|> Seek the aid of the Knights of the Ebon Blade in Acherus above the Broken Isles.  <|text|> If we are to infuse the shard's power into the Ashbringer we will need help. We cannot wield such dark magic; however, I know who can. . . The Knights of the Ebon Blade. I will commission a flight for you to Acherus at once and meet you there - find Aludane Whitecloud in Dalaran when you are ready.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Golden Beetle <|obj|> &lt; Krag'wa's bulbous eyes turn towards you.  <|text|> <Krag'wa's eyes widen as you pull out the beetle. Before you can react, his enormous, sticky tongue whips out and snatches it from your hand. In a moment he has gulped down the prize. ><Krag'wa settles down onto his belly, emits a satisfied belch, and closes his eyes. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sanctum of Domination - Damned If You Don't <|obj|> Collect 4 Phylactery Shards from Kel'Thuzad within the Sanctum of Domination on Normal Difficulty.  <|text|> I feel Kel'Thuzad's presence in these halls. Claim shards from his phylactery and I'll be able to open a new pathway into his chambers.

Four shards should be enough. We wouldn't want him coming back again would we?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hozen Love Their Keys <|obj|> Get the Yeti Shackle Key from Cho Cho the Wicked and release Old Poot Poot.  <|text|> The hozen have a yeti! They call it Old Poot Poot and keep it at the back of their cave. Hozen are normally scared of yeti, but now they feed it grummles. They have a Hunter Chief, Cho Cho the Wicked. Can you see if he has a key on him to the yeti shackles? Bad fortune for hozen if a yeti is loose in their fort.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> An Angler on Our Team <|obj|> Talk to Nat Pagle and ask him to join our cause.  <|text|> You truly are a master fisherman!

I would be delighted to join you here on Draenor and help you catch as many lunkers as you can. But first, let's grab a drink.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Begin the Assault <|obj|> Begin the assault on the Broken Shore.  <|text|> The battle for our world has been hard fought, but with the power of your weapon and the combined forces of Azeroth, we have driven the demon invaders back at every turn.

Now we stand once again upon the Broken Shore, poised to do that which we previously failed to accomplish. Let us not forget those who sacrificed everything to give us this chance. 

Our first objective is to take the hill before us, so that we may build a stronghold. Steel yourself, <name>. The assault on the Broken Shore begins now.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Where is Prince Renathal?  <|obj|> Speak with Stonehead, gatekeeper of the Ember Ward.  <|text|> This is not victory, $p. If Prince Renathal does not return, we've merely delayed defeat.

The Prince was last seen during an assault on the Master's keep alongside Duke Theotar.

We don't know the Prince's fate, but we've learned that Duke Theotar was banished to the Ember Ward.

The Ember Ward is a land of madness and torture. Blighted by the Light, the Master sends his most hated enemies there to suffer unending agony.

Enter the Ember Ward, find Theotar, and discover the Prince's fate.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Wilds of Feralas <|obj|> Travel to Feralas and speak with Konu Runetotem at Camp Ataya.  <|text|> You are truly brave to help us protect these lands, hero. If you wish to do more for the wilds, there are others in need of your aid. The verdant forests of Feralas lie to the south. There, in the shade of the mighty Twin Colossals, you must seek out Konu Runetotem. He has found signs of a disturbing illness. Follow the road west around the Twin Colossals to find Camp Ataya. Go in peace, <name>, and walk with the Earth Mother.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Brew For Brewfest <|obj|> You have 4 minutes to ride the ram and maintain 3 different levels of speed for 8 seconds.  <|text|> There's always a need for more kegs at Brewfest, and Kharanos has a lot of kegs they can spare! I'll lend you one of my personal rams. Every time you bring me a keg, I'll give you some tokens.  I'll even let you use the ram for a bit longer for every keg you bring me! Take heed! Once you start this, you won't be able to do it again until tomorrow. Are you sure you're ready to do this?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ancient Skinning Knife <|obj|> Return the Ancient Skinning Knife to Rana the Cutta.  <|text|> Within the scarred flesh of the beast, you find a notched golden blade embedded under its skin. Carefully extracting the blade, you can't help but feel like this is an old Zandalari skinning knife. You should show this to Rana the Cutta.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Yorla Darksnare <|obj|> Slay Yorla Darksnare.  <|text|> I've found out who's pulling the strings on this operation here. Yorla Darksnare is directing the Dark Iron dwarves from a camp to the east, and it might've been orders to have the gnolls steal Ironforge's gold in the first place. What's more, she's a wanted criminal. . . she's been inciting rebellion and attacks against Ironforge since Magni was still alive. She can't slip through our fingers this time, <name>. Go and get her!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Rattle of Bones <|obj|> Give the Rattle of Bones to the Freewind Brave at Darkcloud Pinnacle in Thousand Needles.  <|text|> A tauren rattle lays here, exuding supernatural power. Its keepers slain, the artifact is undefended. Surely the brave will have some insight into its significance?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Your Continued Support <|obj|> Anchorite Ayuri at Sun's Reach in Sunwell Isle wants you to donate 10 gold.  <|text|> We've built a memorial to honor those slain in battle.  It's but a small consolation to the families that lost their loved ones. I am taking up a collection to aid the orphans and spouses of our war heroes.  If you can spare a small donation it would go a long way.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Wisp and the Shadow <|obj|> Defeat the Shade of Xavius in Darkheart Thicket on Mythic Difficulty and dye his shroud.  <|text|> <name>, have you heard of the nightmare lord, Xavius, whose shade haunts Darkheart Thicket? I have heard that this shade is sometimes seen wearing a colorless shroud. This shroud is steeped in powerful magic and the wisp will draw it out for you. If you can fight the shade, take the shroud, and use your skills to dye it, I will show you how to work wonders!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Egg Hunt <|obj|> Disable the Shadow Cloak Generators until you unveil Aviana's Egg.  <|text|> Skylord Omnuron wants us to find Aviana's Egg, and I can almost guarantee you it's cloaked by one of Sethria's shadow devices. Search around the camp for shadow cloak generators and shut those things down until you find the egg. Once you've unveiled it, I'll call out to the other druids. Defend that egg until we can carry it off to safety. Go get that egg, <name>!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ignoring the Warnings <|obj|> Destroy 12 Warring Elementals.  <|text|> Ignore the shaman, soldier.  Certain powers-that-be within the Horde demand that I keep him with me, but I assure you, that Thrall-loving farseer truly sees no farther than the borders of this hut. Elementals war against one another to the west of here.  I normally wouldn't mind, but I need that land clear to secure a broader shipping route to and from the Barrens.  The elementals are normally quite strong, but they are weakened by their attacks against one another.  Use this knowledge to destroy them.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Deathdealer's Leggings <|obj|> Bring Ouro's Intact Hide, 2 Idols of Night, 5 Stone Scarabs and 5 Crystal Scarabs to Kandrostrasz inside Ahn'Qiraj.  <|text|> You seek to prove your worth to my kind, mortal?  Very well, perhaps we can be of mutual assistance. The ancient sandworm, Ouro, is a being of legendary power.  He is rumored to have been created by the Old God himself as a mockery of life. His skin is unnatural. . . thick, nearly impregnable, yet it's flexible and allows him to move with the speed and grace of a much smaller creature. Bring me a sample of his skin along with other minor components and I shall craft you leggings of great power.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Nowhere to Hide <|obj|> Slay 16 Sunreavers in the Sunreaver's Sanctuary.  <|text|> The Sunreaver's Sanctuary is still crawling with those Horde-loving Sunreavers. Jaina will have sent the reasonable ones to the Violet Hold. The rest refuse to leave, raising their weapons against us. Show them the cost of their defiance. They now face the judgment of the Alliance, the Silver Covenant, and the Kirin Tor!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Thek'talon's Talon <|obj|> Windrocs can be found all over Nagrand, from the highest peaks to the lowest valleys.  <|text|> What's that you got there? <Gazmolf examines the talon>Hey! That definitely looks like it belonged to Thek'talon, and even if it's not who's to say otherwise? Great work, here's your cut!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [DNT] Custom Delays <|obj|> Kill the Ridiculously Large Bakar outside the Ohn'iri Springs.  <|text|> Finally, a friend! I'm with the Dragonscale Expedition, same as you

I came to study the Ohn'iri Springs, but customs dictate I must prove myself first. You know how centaurs are.

There was a rather large bakar over yonder that should do the trick. Mind killing it for me? In the name of the expedition, of course.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Melor Sends Word <|obj|> Speak with Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.  <|text|> <name>, Melor Stonehoof has heard of your deeds, and has set a path before you. If you wish to take it, then go to Thunder Bluff and speak with Melor.  You will find him on Hunter's Rise.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Weapons of Darkness <|obj|> Capture 5 Elemental-Imbued Weapons from Anvilrage dwarves in Blackrock Depths, then break them over the Black Anvil in Shadowforge City.  <|text|> Blackrock Depths has long been home to our enemies, but now the Shattered Hand has discovered that the Dark Irons and Twilight's Hammer are increasing their collaboration. Using the cult's knowledge, the Dark Iron dwarves are imbuing their weapons with elemental powers. They've outfitted the Anvilrage legion with these fearsome new weapons. I want you to go into Blackrock Depths and gather the weapons from the Anvilrage dwarves there and break them over the Black Anvil in the heart of Shadowforge City.  <|endoftext|>

Once I have done that I will go to the bombing site and begin the process of regrowth. Perhaps one day a new grove will bloom - a grove infused with the spirit of my child and the fallen night elf youths. If you wish to travel to Desolace, I hear word of a blood elf named Furien seeking adventuring partners. Perhaps you should seek him out. Farewell, friend, I will never forget you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Piece of the Puzzle <|obj|> Kill the Horrific Aberration in the basement of the inn.  <|text|> I. . . I remember now. Watch Commander Branson told us to stay in the inn. . . he said we would be safe here. Then. . . Then that THING broke through and slaughtered everyone! The last thing I remember seeing was it descending into the larder.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Under Siege <|obj|> Sabotage 3 Iron Demolishers.  <|text|> Those Iron Horde cannons are laying waste to our troops. I'm not sure how much more of this we can handle. Our forces are already spread too thin. There has to be a way to stop those war machines.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Spell Research <|obj|> Recover research notes from the Defias bandits and use them to learn a new spell, then return to Khelden Bremen in Northshire.  <|text|> I will teach you what I can, <name>, but your own research will lead to astonishing power. Studying notes left by Azeroth's greatest archmages is an excellent place to start. The Abbey's archives used to contain a myriad of arcane research notes, but they were stolen by Defias agents.

Recover spell notes from the bandits to the east and use this primer to decipher them. Return to me once your research is successful.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> So You Think You Can Sew <|obj|> Craft a Rune-Threaded Silkweave Robe and a set of Rune-Threaded Silkweave Bracers at Lyndras' Finishing Table.  <|text|> Very good, I think we're ready to begin. < Lyndras steals a glance at your powerful weapon.

<|startoftext|> Grimrail Depot <|obj|> Defeat Skylord Tovra in Grimrail Depot.  <|text|> We must move quickly, commander. As we speak the Grimrail is preparing to depart Grimrail Depot to deliver a massive battalion of troops to Shattrath.

You must stop Tovra and the Grimrail before it reaches Shattrath!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Kasha Will Fly Again <|obj|> Gather 8 Mudsnout Blossoms.  <|text|> Kasha will fly again, <name>. She must if we are to claim vengeance! Sadly, Orkus must stay here with Kasha. You must help us. I beg of you! Listen carefully, quest giver. When I first arrived here I flew around for days to learn the lay of the land. There is a farm east of here that has long since been abandoned and is now overrun by gnolls. On this farm grows a special type of mushroom known as the mudsnout. Go to the stead and gather mudsnout for Kasha. Return here when your pack is full.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tomb of Sargeras: Aegwynn's Path <|obj|> Collect 4 Fragment of the Guardian's Seal from the Maiden of Vigilance in the Tomb of Sargeras on Heroic Difficulty.  <|text|> As we sealed the tomb, I entrusted the final piece of Sargeras' prison to the Maiden of Vigilance. If you had it you could move freely throughout the tomb, but I know not what became of the keeper and fear the worst.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Battle for Azsuna <|obj|> Defeat Fel Commander Xeritas in Azsuna.  <|text|> The vile demon commanding the assault must be stopped. I can get us close, but once we're there I'll rely on you and your allies to help bring down the demonic forces.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Frostfire Bindings <|obj|> Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make Frostfire Bindings if you bring her the following: 1 Desecrated Bindings, 6 Wartorn Cloth Scraps, 1 Arcane Crystal and 1 Nexus Crystal.  <|text|> As a Watcher, I was allowed access to many of Medivh's personal effects. Among those items, I found the tomes most enlightening. While the majority of the books were filled with - to put it bluntly - tripe, there were some gems. One of those tomes documented the creation of a set of armor fit for an archmage: Frostfire. <Angela points to her head. >It's all in here and I am willing to share the fruits of that knowledge with you as long as you are able to provide me with the necessary materials.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Take it to 'Em!  <|obj|> Mack wants you to investigate Khartut's Tomb.  <|text|> We was lucky to escape, <class>. I'm not sure I'd feel right if we didn't take care of them ambushers. Hows about you git back up to Khartut's tomb and give them little buggers what fer! It's off to the northeast, just inside the entrance to Uldum if'n I recollect correctly. What're you looking at? I sure ain't in no condition to do it!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Stolen Power <|obj|> Collect 8 Scrolls of Shirakess.  <|text|> From the void these naga pull their strength. 

Each scroll they record, shared knowledge -- that knowledge is power.

It stands to reason, if we take away their knowledge, we steal their power.

My logic may be flawed, but let's do it anyway!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Ordo Warbringer <|obj|> Kill the Ordo Warbringer.  <|text|> You've taken the shield down at Fire Camp Ordo. Go back there before the shield goes up again. Time to head into the cave and slay their chief!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Anthion's Parting Words <|obj|> Return to Mokvar in Orgimmar with a set of  Shadowcraft Boots, Shadowcraft Pants and Shadowcraft Spaulders.  <|text|> Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet.  In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us. The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the amulet back together.  Return to Mokvar and tell him that Bodley is his only hope for finding the remaining pieces.  Speak to him about any rewards you've arranged for. I, for once, shall rest in peace.  I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Leave No Weapon Behind <|obj|> Retrieve 12 Rusty Rifles from Farson Hold on the north side of Tol Barad Peninsula.  <|text|> Battle supplies are hard to come by on this rock.  Every time we hold off another Alliance attack, it feels like we are fighting with sticks and stones. Reports have come in that Keep Lord Farson on the north side of the island has a large stockpile of rifles that we could use.  Can you head down there and check it out? Be careful <name>, Farson's followers will do anything to protect him.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A True Sunwalker <|obj|> Go to Shadowfang Keep and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from Commander Springvale, 5 crates of Moonsteel Ingots, and 5 Deathless Sinew.  <|text|> I have watched your training, <name>. Yours is the path of an exemplary Sunwalker, a brave defender of the Horde and a follower of our ways. As a reward for your dedication, the warchief has commissioned his personal smith to forge a special weapon. The cursed Shadowfang Keep in Silverpine Forest is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and recover the holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moonsteel ingots, and sinew from the ghouls and geists infesting the keep.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Gilded Abacus <|obj|> Summon your steward companion via Summon Steward, then give them the Gilded Abacus.  <|text|> <A beautifully crafted abacus rests in your hands. Its frame glimmers and shines in the light, its beads smooth auric orbs.

Your steward will appreciate this as not only a useful gift, but an exquisite one. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Old Ways <|obj|> Collect an Elysian Thread, 4 Cloudstrider Pelts, and 12 Larion Plumes.  <|text|> You there! Might I ask your help?

I must confess, with the lack of new souls arriving, our supplies have dwindled. We lack the means to clothe arrivals in proper kyrian attire.

Before the forging of the centurions, aspirants trained against the native wildlife. Perhaps there is another way these beasts can prove useful.

If you collect materials from the cloudstriders and larions nearby, we can use them to ensure our new arrivals look the part.

Oh, and some thread from Mirene, if you would!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bad Feeling, Worse Result <|obj|> Defeat the Ghost of Lin Da-Gu.  <|text|> <As you open the scroll, you realize your worst fears have come true: the sha energies have corrupted the Lin recipe. ><Your only choice is to defeat the released energies in the hope that the scroll can be saved. > <|endoftext|>

Until then, I'll need you to disenchant the wards we come across.

Speak to me when you are ready, and I will lead you to my grave.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Ending the San'layn Threat <|obj|> Kill Blood Prince Dreven.  <|text|> Blood Prince Dreven has barricaded himself in the lowest deck of this ship. He's trapped down there.

<|startoftext|> Raptor Horns <|obj|> Gather 5 Intact Raptor Horns from Sunscale Scytheclaws, and bring them to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet.  <|text|> The raptors of the Barrens are smarter than raptors in other lands.

<|startoftext|> Direhorn Raiders <|obj|> Kill 12 Direhorn Grimtotems and return to Apprentice Morlann at Tabetha's Farm.  <|text|> The Grimtotems up at Direhorn Post, just to the north, are getting bolder by the day.

I guess there are a lot of constructs running around in there, yeah?  Well, take out the biggest, baddest construct in that place and grab its power source!  I am pretty sure I can fuse that source into the necklace. Without that power source, fixing the necklace will be impossible.

<|startoftext|> The Right Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet <|obj|> Use the Brazier of Beckoning to summon forth Jarien and Sothos and slay them.  <|text|> The siblings, Jarien and Sothos, decided to join the Scarlet Crusade upon the disbanding of our mercenary company. They took the Right Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet with them. Good riddance, I say, but we need that piece back. From what we could gather, they were actually slain by Grand Crusader Dathrohan himself for failing the initiation rites inside his chamber in the Scarlet Bastion. In any case, we. . . meaning you, are still going to need to retrieve that piece of the amulet.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Reconstructing "The Final Truth" <|obj|> Collect Torn Pages of "The Final Truth" from Lost Areas within Horrific Visions for Wrathion in the Chamber of Heart.  <|text|> I dare not repeat aloud the horrors that are recorded in these pages. The words themselves seem to shift and morph as I read them, as if the book itself is attempting to induce a descent into madness.

This is taxing work, but it is necessary if we are to fully prepare you for the dangers of Ny'alotha. For as disturbing as its descriptions might be, setting foot within it will prove more challenging by an order of magnitude.

Keep looking for pages from the book, <name>. But. . . leave the reading to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Maelstrom <|obj|> Go through the Portal to the Maelstrom and speak to Thrall.  <|text|> Thank the spirits you're here, <name>. We're not sure how much longer we can maintain the rift in the Maelstrom. Our most powerful members, led by Thrall, are barely preventing the tear. Last I heard, our only hope was to go through the breach and attempt to stabilize it from the other side. I will conjure a portal.  Take it and report to Thrall as soon as you can.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Since Time Forgotten. . .  <|obj|> Slay Gnosh Brognat, leader of the ogres at the Bladespire Outpost.  <|text|> Since time forgotten we have fought with the Bladespire ogres.

I could not observe them long before having to flee, but I did manage to recover a relic of my own.

<|startoftext|> Culling the Coven <|obj|> Kill 25 of Matron Levae's minions in the Elderstone Mine.  <|text|> If the mine really was their objective, I can only imagine they'd have even more forces in there.  

My men and I may be able to take care of the remnants out here, but if an even bigger force comes out of that mine, we're not going to stand a chance.

While you're hunting down the matron with this wicker contraption, do you think you could. . . you know. . . soften them up a bit?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> We Must be Prepared!  <|obj|> Talk to Lady S'theno at the Illidari Camp on the Broken Shore.  <|text|> The Legion ships are gone, for now. It's only a matter of time before they attack again, and we must be prepared.

If there's anything I know about mages, they can't resist a magical puzzle. Take the bag of water elemental bracers and see if they can shed any light on the Stone's curse.  Look for the Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver in particular.  I've dealt with him before, and his knowledge is vast.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Invasion of Space <|obj|> Defeat any $1oa commanders in Invasion Points.  <|text|> We are on the Legion home world, but we must not let ourselves get caught unawares.

Maybe you can lend us a hand?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rebellious Souls <|obj|> Meet Rathan and Emeni at Sixfold Recluse.  <|text|> Please hear us out, Maw Walker.

When Margrave Gharmal launched his attack on Bastion, there were many, such as Emeni and myself, that opposed his actions.

It's only a matter of time before the wilds creep back in and overtake the land we have kept safe for centuries. Please, re-ignite the bonfires. They are critical in keeping the province safe, and they are memorials to the founders of our way of life.  <|endoftext|>

As they rushed back to the Grim Guzzler, a portion of their transport fell off.  More importantly, you managed to keep the camp safe. . . today. Head over to Boxey and explain your heroic triumph over the Dark Iron dwarves.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To Faronaar <|obj|> Speak to Vindicator Boros along Old Coast Path.  <|text|> We are keeping a close eye on Legion movements at Faronaar in Azsuna. Our intel suggests that a high-ranking lieutenant, possibly the dreadlord Balnazzar himself, masterminds the attacks in that region. This may be our chance to strike a blow at the Legion's leadership. Vindicator Boros commands our forces at the front. He would welcome your help, Highlord.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Way of the Brew <|obj|> Bring 1 Ginseng to the Master of the Brew.  <|text|> The Pandaren Way of the Brew produces. . . Well, I'll let the Master of the Brew explain it. Bring him some ginseng and he will show you the way.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest <|obj|> Speak with the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.  <|text|> <class>, I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them, but you must get to Stars' Rest with all due haste! The upheaval in the land this morning is sure to have broader repercussions than just inconveniencing the natives. Stars' Rest is westward past the intersection of the road leading north out of the harbor. There is an archmage there named Modera. She will be expecting you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cheese for Glowergold <|obj|> Combine the empty cheese platter with Aged Dalaran Limburger from the cheese shop "One More Glass" and with 6 Half Full Dalaran Wine Glasses found on tables around Dalaran.  <|text|> Ranid Glowergold in the Leatherworkers shop in Dalaran has had a sudden craving for wine and cheese. Collect cheese which is on the shelf at "One More Glass" in central Dalaran and half full wine glasses found on tables all over the city.  Pour the wine together into a bottle and serve it with the cheese to Ranid. We don't think he will know the difference.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Briefing <|obj|> Listen to the briefing.  <|text|> We haven't much time. 

The Scourge have attacked Tranquillien, and there's nothing to hold them back.

We must take decisive action.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Advice from the Cenarion Circle <|obj|> Report to Cenarion Observer Shayana at the Surwich in the Blasted Lands.  <|text|> I believe that the taint of the Blasted Lands has finally exerted its influence over my friend Wormthorn.  His experiment has failed, and his great-tree now only serves as a focus for the demons to rally around. The tree must come down, and Wormthorn with it.  Speak with the Cenarion Observer on the other side of town; she should have some idea how to proceed. <name>: the act we are about to commit must not be made known to the townspeople of Surwich.  Morale is low enough as-is.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Nature's Remedy <|obj|> Harvest 6 Prickly Plum in Zul'Ahjin.  <|text|> Your friend doesn't have much time left. The scorpid venom is likely rotting his veins right now. 

He will certainly meet death without a cure.

I will help. 

The first ingredient I'll need is the root of the prickly plum cactus. Its natural healing properties will make a suitable base for the salve.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Skullsplitter Mojo <|obj|> Obtain 6 Skullsplitter Mojos from Skullsplitter trolls in the Ziata'jai Ruins and the Balia'mah Ruins.  <|text|> <The skull speaks again. >I have my body, thanks to you, your raptor, and Gan'zulah.  Now, if I remember correctly, you and your witch doctor friend will need some mojo to complete this ritual. The Bloodscalps keep mojo in Zul'Kunda, but it is weak.  Your Darkspears' mojo will not work either.  No. . . you want to take from the Skullsplitter trolls, across the river to the east. Hurry back, <race>.  I will be watching. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Keepers of the Hammer <|obj|> Meet Mayla Highmountain at Thunder Totem in Highmountain.  <|text|> The Highmountain Tribes had intended to pledge our allegiance to your forces. We know war has come with the Burning Legion. However, we have been betrayed from within and must now ask for your aid. A great relic, the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, was stolen from our people by the vile drogbar. We need your help in recovering it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Buried Beneath <|obj|> Look through the spyglass in Rensai's Watchpost.  <|text|> Taoshi set up a spyglass on the ridge edge to show me what her scouting uncovered. Go over and take a look.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Call of Battle <|obj|> Speak to Hymdall.  <|text|> Once, the mighty titanforged keepers of Ulduar and Odyn acted as one. Ever since Odyn broke off to create the valarjar, not even Odyn's own son Thorim is bound to follow his father's advice. There is one hope to unite the forces of Skyhold and Ulduar however. The Gjallarhorn was a gift given to Hymdall before Odyn's departure. The keepers of Ulduar are oathbound to answer the call of the Gjallarhorn were it to be sounded as it would signal that the end times are upon us!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Slumbering King <|obj|> Defeat Queen Angerboda and stop the ritual to awaken King Ymiron.  <|text|> A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the overlord. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below. However, it appears that the queen of the vrykul, Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the Winter's Terrace, on the north end of Gjalerbron. If you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dignified Disguises <|obj|> Find Belastrasza and her friends in Valdrakken.  <|text|> $p! I have crafted masterful disguises for me and my friends, but there is only one way to know if they are perfect.

Let's play hide and seek! Find us in Valdrakken and I will know my disguises need work!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Big Game, Big Bait <|obj|> Use Mylra's Knife to obtain 5 Sides of Basilisk Meat from dead Jadecrest Basilisks.  <|text|> We're only going to get one shot at capturing Abyssion, <name>.  Let's make it count. We'll test out the trap on the biggest of the stone dragons in the Alabaster Shelf. To lure the stone matriarch, we're going to need to gather sufficient bait. Take this knife and carve 5 sides of basilisk meat.  That ought to be enough even for her appetite.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Community Feast <|obj|> Community Feasts are one of the main features you unlock with the Iskaara Tuskarr Reputation.  <|text|> Our community feast is happening RIGHT NOW! This is when everyone pitches in and makes the best soup we can.

You should join us!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> None Left Behind <|obj|> Rescue 3 Injured Sailors.  <|text|> Your friend has been doing everything she can to save my crew. I'm deeply appreciative. We're still dealing with more than we can handle here: quenching the fires on the wreckage, getting my people out, fighting off these evil sea creatures, and trying to prevent the prisoners from escaping. We're simply in over our heads. I still have men on the ship that we need to get clear before the wreckage collapses on them. I know this is asking a lot, but can you help?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Nation of Kul Tiras <|obj|> Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Stormwind Harbor.  <|text|> Kul Tiras is the greatest naval power in Azeroth, and a former ally. But we've had little contact with them since Jaina's father, Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, was defeated at Theramore.

Many have criticized Jaina's decision that day, saying she believed so deeply in the promise of peace between the Alliance and Horde that she betrayed her own father.

Perhaps she feels the time has come to atone for this.

Loath as I am to put Jaina in harm's way. . . Kul Tiras must join the Alliance.

Good luck.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Radical Notion <|obj|> Exarch Larethor in the Magisters' Terrace wants you to kill Vexallus and obtain its essence.  <|text|> We cannot afford to lose this war. I'd like to empower our sentries so that brave men and women don't have to die. The Legion has gotten a hold of a powerful elemental being. Its essence could be just what we need.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Humble Task <|obj|> Chief Hawkwind wants you to search for his mother near the water well to the southeast of Camp Narache.  <|text|> All members of the tribe share in the harmony of life. We live together and work together. Our commitment to one another carries with it a high degree of responsibility. I ask of you now a humble task. My mother set out this morning to fetch water from the well to the southeast of Narache. It has been quite some time now. Perhaps you could check on her for me while I attend to tribal matters here?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Allegiance to the Horde <|obj|> Return to Silvermoon City and report back to Lor'themar Theron.  <|text|> Your people suffered a great betrayal by the Alliance.  You've succeeded in fending off Darnassian attacks as well as spies from Ironforge.  Now you've defeated a powerful Scourge leader at the footsteps of your home.  Your worthiness is no longer in question. It is now apparent that you need us and we need you.  Return to Lor'themar.  Tell him I received his message loud and clear. <The warchief crushes the letter inside his palm. >Welcome to the Horde, elf.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> All Along the Waterways <|obj|> Slay 3 Duskwatch Orbitists.  <|text|> I've noticed some wandering eyes, lately.

I am more than happy to continue delivering the goods to Vanthir, but it is getting increasingly dangerous to do so. 

The Duskwatch that walk the bazaar are by far the most observant.

Find and slay the Orbitists so that I may deliver the goods safely.

I will follow behind with the shipment.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Beldak the Elder <|obj|> It is good to know the people of this land still pay homage to the olden races.  <|text|> It is good to know the people of this land still pay homage to the olden races.  I bid you well, <name>, and offer you this token. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hazardous Materials <|obj|> Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to go to Voltarus and complete any tasks Drakuru has for you.  <|text|> Blight crystals? ! What could this scumbag Drakuru be up to? Clearly, he's working on something significant. Continue to do his bidding and perhaps once he's more familiar with you he'll reveal his plans. In the meantime, we need to have a look at these crystals. While you're in Voltarus, try to get some samples of the harvested crystals when no one's looking. Be alert! Handling those crystals can trigger your disguise to fail.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ingvar Must Die!  <|obj|> Dark Ranger Marrah has asked you to kill Ingvar the Plunderer in Utgarde Keep, then bring his head to High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing.  <|text|> Finally, someone's come. I've been here far too long and my wits are beginning to fail me. Of our entire recon party, only I remain. I shall give you my report and it will be up to you to act upon the information. Know this, <class>; it did not come cheaply. These vrykul are relentless fighters. Given their numbers and their savage tactics, our only hope is to bring down their leader and pray it brings chaos to their ranks. Ingvar is his name. Bring his head to Anselm when your duty is done.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Non-Prophet Organization <|obj|> Locate Velen.  <|text|> I have complete faith that Velen is nearby. We would know if he had been captured. All the same, we must not delay. The Legion has a vested interest in finding him after all he has done to resist them. I shudder to think what they might do, given the chance. That is why I am going with you. We will find Velen and help him track down the Crest of Knowledge. We must have faith in his mission or all will be lost.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Setting Sun <|obj|> Witness the fall of Anasterian.  <|text|> Remember the Sunwell.

We ride into battle with those words for a reason. We lost so much that day. . .

I lost so much that day.

Shine the lantern on the southern side of the island, where the Dead Scar meets the sea. There you will see how the fall of the Sunwell began. And with it, the last act of the High Elves.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Relic Renewed <|obj|> Observe Brann as he puts the Titan Disc back together.  <|text|> Very good, very good! Now that we have all the pieces, it's time to put this disc back together!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Fallen Exarch <|obj|> Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to destroy the contents of the Auchenai Coffin.  <|text|> They are feeding the souls they steal to a coffin that they have dragged out from the Auchenai Crypts. My scouts believe the contents of the coffin to contain the first exarch of the crypts. They seek to resurrect the ancient one! You must battle your way to the western side of Auchindoun and disturb the contents of that coffin before they feed it enough souls. Should you lose your way, follow the walking souls. Destroy whatever is inside that coffin!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Key Story <|obj|> Seek out Weaponsmith Koref and interview him about the key.  <|text|> Here for the latest? Well, have I got news for you.

A weaponsmith was just here visiting Tithris. Koref, I think? Couldn't help but overhear their discussion about some sort of ancient key. Might be of interest to you, what with all your artifact hunting. Weaponsmith Koref was headed back to the Obsidian Enclave. You should head there and get the scoop about this ancient key.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Razzeric's Tweaking <|obj|> Retrieve the Seaforium Booster for Razzeric in the Shimmering Flats.  <|text|> Pozzik's a great mechanic, I know that, but he's afraid to just load on the firepower and grab on for the ride. Not me, though. After Pozzik finishes with a racer, I take a little time to put my own modifications on--you know, loosening up the controls, removing parts of the frame, and adding more juice! I ordered a seaforium booster from Shreev at the Gizmorium in Gadgetzan, but apparently the zeppelin it was being sent on crashed in Dustwallow Marsh! I gotta have it, <name>!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Gildenite Grab <|obj|> Collect 3 Gildenite from rare monsters and treasure chests in Bastion.  <|text|> Our allies in Bastion are in possession of a special ore known as gildenite. A golden metal used for many things in their lands, it is also useful to us.

Once upon a time, we would have traded for it. Now, we have little to trade, and they have little to give.

Yet it is a necessary component to focus our magics, capable of harnessing magical energy and amplifying it.

Should you come across any in your travels, liberate it, and return it to me. I shall use what we need, and share the remainder.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Down the Scarlet Path <|obj|> Destroy 30 Undead Ravagers, then return to Brother Anton at Nijel's Point.  <|text|> I will be frank.  We are at war with the Scourge.  It is an evil that corrupts our people and infects our land.  It must be stopped before it overwhelms us and drags our world into shadow.  We of the Scarlet Crusade have sworn to fight the Scourge with body and soul. If you are with us, then gather your courage and prove your allegiance--destroy the undead ravagers of Desolace, in the Valley of Bones to the south. Do this, and the Crusade will embrace you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Preserve the True Future <|obj|> Stop the attacks from the Obsidian, Ruby, Azure, and Emerald Dragonshrines in one attempt of the Deaths of Chromie scenario.  <|text|> I know how this looks, <name>. I'm not asking for your help simply because I don't want to get killed.

I need your help because this isn't how I'm SUPPOSED to die. I will die - I've seen it! - but it happens much later than this. Besides, meddling with the timeways for personal reasons - well, it goes against pretty much everything my dragonflight stands for.

Let's stop all four of the dragonshrine attacks. That should do the trick.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A New Adventure Awaits <|obj|> Return to Stormwind to embark on a new adventure.  <|text|> <name>! You're needed in the present. Things have. . . well, you should just come back to see.

I would finish what you're doing then head back. I can't keep you in the past for much longer!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Warlock's Bargain <|obj|> Investigate the first expedition warlock's corpse.  <|text|> While you were mowing down hordes of undead, I was scouting more of the area with Lindie's device.

I saw what looked like a portal out near the bridge, along with the corpse of a warlock we thought was lost in the shipwreck.

Think you can go investigate the area and try to close that portal? We have enough problems on this island as it is.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Back to Boralus <|obj|> Speak with Yvera Dawnwing to return to Boralus.  <|text|> That should just about do it for now, then. We'll be in touch if the fighting heats back up again. No doubt it'll be any day now.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Alliance Relations <|obj|> Speak to Takata Steelblade in Desolace.  <|text|> As the Alliance progresses deeper and deeper into Kalimdor, incorrect conclusions may be drawn about the Horde making pacts with the Burning Legion. The Warchief cannot allow that to happen. And with his blessing, I am taking control of overseeing them removed. I have agents in the area of Desolace at the Ghost Walker Post north of the great Kodo Graveyard. Head south of the Charred Vale in the Stonetalon Mountains and you shall come across it. When you arrive, seek out Takata Steelblade.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Show Them Gnome Mercy!  <|obj|> Collect the Collection of Souls.  <|text|> <The blood drains out of Toshley 's face. >These orbs are made up of both nether energy and souls, some of them gnome souls! How dare they!  Were they the ones killing our people that traveled north? ! <name>, you must put a stop to this, and the only way to do that is to finish off their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan. You'll have to coax him out of hiding though.  I'm guessing that you can do that by killing a lot of his Razaani ethereal. Bring me the collection of souls that he no doubt has.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Missing Diplomat <|obj|> Find Private Hendel in Dustwallow Marsh.  <|text|> Private Hendel is to the west of here. He's currently on guard duty protecting some of Theramore's infiltrators while they rest. They've been keeping tabs on the Horde base, Brackenwall, and looking for anything else that might threaten our borders. You should have no problem finding him; just look for the tents along the road. I have another matter to attend to, but I shall catch up to you soon enough. You can always find me in the Lady Proudmoore's tower if you have any problems.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Beastmaster's Quarry: The Tiger <|obj|> Bring the Krasari Elder to Huntsman Blake.  <|text|> The elder cat is alive, but stunned. You should bring it back to Huntsman Blake before it wakes up.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trading Favors: De Other Side <|obj|> Obtain a Golden Death Mask from Mueh'zala in De Other Side.  <|text|> Mueh'zala is an ancient and primitive creature that commands a place known as De Other Side. Little is known about this land, as we are not permitted to visit. We have sent many offers of trade, yet there has never been a reply. 

A pity, as the few that have escaped Mueh'zala's clutches claim his domain to be a place of many oddities.

We would never ask you to venture into such danger. There is, however, a standing offer of trade for things procured from Mueh'zala's grasp.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu <|obj|> Travel to Manaforge Coruu, east of Area 52, and obtain the Coruu Access Crystal from Overseer Seylanna.  <|text|> Your success at B'naar has given us a great deal of hope, <name>. We've shared our discoveries with the Scryers and in return they've given us more information on the remaining manaforges. Three other manaforges still stand, in full control of the Sunfury army. You will find Manaforge Coruu to the east.  Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal there.  Obtain it and use it on the manaforge's control console to begin the emergency shutdown. We're all counting on you, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Claiming the Light <|obj|> Use the Shimmering Vessel on the Blood Elf Magisters to fill it and return to Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Silvermoon City.  <|text|> Take this vessel, <name>. The enchantment it bears will allow you to draw the last vestiges of the Light surrounding these magisters. They once tended the captive naaru and some of its energy yet remains within them. It will be just enough to restore your comrade to life. Do not worry about the magisters, <name>. I have seen to their care, and Lord Solanar assures me that Lady Liadrin seeks a new source of power even now.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Worgen in the Woods <|obj|> Bring Calor's note to Jonathan Carevin.  <|text|> Here you go, <name>. Bring this message to Master Carevin. <He quickly removes a piece of faded parchment and offers it to you. >A few more like you, and we will outnumber the Night Watch! Perhaps then we could complete the work that we few carry on today.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> It's Scrap Work. . .  <|obj|> Use the Coiled Current Culler on dead V-300 SENTRIES at the Abandoned Junkheap, then use it to collect the Ub3r-Spanner schematic from the Reinforced Schematic Cache.  <|text|> <name>, I'm glad you stopped by.

The Ub3r-Spanner, capable of crafting powerful constructs, and its schematic have been lost for years. Intel tells us that its schematic is located in a locked cache in The Abandoned Junkheap.

You'll need to overcharge its electric barrier to gain access. Take my Current Culler and soak up some of the latent current from the sentries there and zap that chest open!

<Shuga makes finger guns and explosion sounds>

Up for some treasure huntin'?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ritualistic Preparations <|obj|> Mine Unsanctified Storm Silver Ore, smelt it into Unsanctified Storm Silver Bars, and get them blessed by Wavesinger De'zan.  <|text|> I have received a request for a shipment of storm silver. It is a fine metal, lightweight and resistant to corrosion. We use it althroughout our ships. It is so strong even de naga use it in some of their weapons! However, any parts that go into de ship have to be blessed by a wavesinger. I can not be bothered with dat nonsense. I do not believe it needs these extra blessings, but what do I know? Harvest a bucketful of ore and get it blessed for me, and I will teach you how to mine it easier.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Good Axe <|obj|> Find a suitable weapon for Thrall amongst the Mawsworn Armaments in Detrithos.  <|text|> I was a damned fool for throwing my axe at that sea hag. We can't afford to lose focus.

The battle ahead won't be easy. I'll need another weapon to help us fight to the waystone.

Looks like these soldiers have plenty of armaments. Let's keep an eye out for one I can use.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Craftsman's Writ <|obj|> You know the drill, kid.  <|text|> You earned this, scrub. Now, don't cry about your orders. Fill 'em or destroy 'em.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sharing the Faith <|obj|> Meditate on the Light, then pray with the kneeling elf to share your meditations.  <|text|> The Light calls us to justice and protection, but also compassion. Our allies are strangers in our lands and we have a duty to teach them our ways.
This Night Elf seeks the Light, but is struggling in his meditation. Would you assist him?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Master Strategist <|obj|> Take A Treatise on Strategy to Professor Thaddeus Paleo at the Darkmoon Faire on Darkmoon Island.  <|text|> This tome of strategy is the masterwork of the famous human general, Anduin Lothar. In his own words, the commander describes the proper deployment of forces and strategies needed to win almost any battle. Professor Thaddeus Paleo of the Darkmoon Faire would probably love to have a look at such a rare book.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Zenn's Bidding <|obj|> Retrieve 2 Nightsaber Fangs, 2 Strigid Owl Feathers and 2 swatches of Webwood Spider Silk.  <|text|> Eager for work, I see.  Lucky for you a day never goes by that I don't wish I had a fledgling <class> to perform my bidding. You see, <name>, I can make you very happy and provide you with things you never dreamed of having.  But in order for that to happen you must bring me certain items. My business in the forest often requires certain. . . reagents.  Fetch for me nightsaber fangs, strigid owl feathers and swatches of webwood spider silk. Let's keep this our little secret, <race>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Guile of the Raptor <|obj|> Speak with Tor'gan at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.  <|text|> This. . . this power. . . . Is this the power of the shamans that Tor'gan tried to show me? I must say, it is interesting. Tell Tor'gan that he has convinced me. . . for the time being. I will listen to what he has to say.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Honor Above All Else <|obj|> Report to Crusade Commander Entari at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.  <|text|> Long has been the path to our salvation, young <class>. We have fought across continents, worlds even, to reach this point. Now we face our greatest challenge: the destruction of the Lich King and his Scourge. Alas, we fight this battle divided. The Horde and Alliance are in the throes of war and will lend us no support. We must remain unyielding in our cause! For what choice have we to do otherwise? Do you join the cause? Lend us your strength, <class>! My commander, Entari, awaits you at his post.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Firmament Stone <|obj|> Speak with Barm Stonebreaker in Highmountain.  <|text|> When working with felslate and demonsteel, one must use special equipment. Specifically, an anvil hard enough to withstand the energy given off when felslate is hammered. Urael and I no longer possess such an anvil. But your friends, the Highmountain tauren, do. Gain access to the Firmament Stone, their sacred anvil, and we can start working with demonsteel again.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Augustus' Receipt Book <|obj|> Bring Augustus' Receipt Book to Augustus the Touched in Terrordale.  <|text|> I'm ready for business!  What you do want? Oh wait. . . I can't open up shop without my receipt book.  How am I to keep track of things without my receipt book? I must have left it in town somewhere.  I had a room in the inn. . . the book must be there. Bring me my book.  Please, bring it to me!  Bring me my book and you'll see!  I'll set up shop and you'll see that my prices are INSANE!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Into Occupied Territory <|obj|> Steal the Night Elf Plans: An'daroth, Night Elf Plans: An'owyn and Night Elf Plans: Scrying on the Sin'dorei, and return them to Dame Auriferous at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.  <|text|> Now, the more direct course of action that we are going to take, to figure out what these night elves are really up to, is to have you go to their island and steal any information that you can come by. I want you to head west down the road out of town to Shalandis Isle, just off the coast. Go there and recover any plans they might have on the island or on their ship.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Kismetric Disc <|obj|> Deliver the item to Firim.  <|text|> < Firim could make use of this item> <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Proper Introductions <|obj|> Return to Alonsus Faol within Netherlight Temple.  <|text|> I'm glad I found you. 

I have a message from Alonsus Faol.

He says introductions are in order, and requests your presence within Netherlight Temple at your earliest convenience.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Gems of the Apexis <|obj|> Find Sun-Sage Chakkis in Tanaan Jungle.  <|text|> Listen, boss. I know you're a jewelcrafter. It's OK, I totally understand - I like money, too! I heard some of them bird fellas talking about some new gem-cuttin' device they got up in Tanaan. I'd be interested in checkin' it out myself, but I've got this whole shipyard mess to deal with right now.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Defias Brotherhood <|obj|> Escort the Defias Traitor to the secret hideout of the Defias Brotherhood.  <|text|> So Stoutmantle sends a scrawny <race> like you to protect me?  Guess you'll have to do.  Better bring some friends too. You know the deal, right?  You watch my back and I'll take you to the Defias hideout.  But you better be close by my side.  The Defias gang wants my head now.  If they see me with you, they'll try to kill me. Let me know when you and any friends you can round up are ready to go.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Heathen's Brand <|obj|> Know this, heathen: A catastrophe has brought us together.  <|text|> Know this, heathen: A catastrophe has brought us together. Your pagan ways are neither understood nor appreciated by Zandalar but we are a fair people. Wear this brand around your neck. It shall serve as both a warning to our enemies and a symbol of your friendship to Zandalar. Continue to serve our people and I will amplify the power of the brand.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Easy As Pie <|obj|> Bring 20 pieces of Pumpkin Pie to Mary Allerton at the feasting area near the gates of Darnassus.  <|text|> Isaac's been hard at work helping celebrants learn about the traditional Pilgrim's Bounty feast and how to make dishes out of all the ingredients we harvest at this time of year. I've been trying to keep the tables stocked with as many of the dishes as I can, but we're running out of one of Isaac's favorites, pumpkin pie. Would you be able to get some for us? If you want to make the pies yourself, you'll need to buy ripe Elwynn pumpkins from the Pilgrim's Bounty vendor outside Stormwind.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Someone Else's Mess <|obj|> Banish demons that have been irresponsibly summoned in Stormheim.  <|text|> A confession alone won't be enough to clear my name. As long as those demons run amuck, people will blame their presence on me. 

Someone needs to clean up the mess that warlock made. I'd do it myself, but I can't be placed at the scene of the crime.

You could banish them though. That would do the trick. Use this orb on newly summoned demons to send them right back where they came from - permanently!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sneaking into Zalamar <|obj|> Sneak into Zalamar to find Jo'chunga.  <|text|> I know you might think nothing has changed, but trust me, de voodoo worked. . . I think.

You should transform into one of de blood trolls when you are near Zalamar, one of their villages.

Jo'chunga should be dere somewhere, most likely near a large gathering of blood trolls.

Find Jo'chunga and tell him I have sent you, den see what he knows about de situation dere.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Roll the Bones <|obj|> Bring 8 Dinosaur Bones to Spark Nilminer in Un'Goro Crater.  <|text|> You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging.  There might be worse things to do in this world. . . but none really leap to mind. We were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons.  Well, there are plenty of live ones there too!  Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones.  Between you and me though, bringing some from live ones will work out just as well.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Freedom to Ruul <|obj|> Escort Ruul, then speak with Yama Snowhoof in Splintertree Post.  <|text|> Eh?  Who are you? <name>?  You're no furbolg.  They are cursed!  They thought I was a bear and captured me, and now they starve me!  My strength is failing. . . Help me escape, then speak with my sister Yama at the Splintertree Post to the east. <name>! I must escape!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Titanic Effort <|obj|> Bring 50 Wakening Essence to Arcanomancer Vridiel.  <|text|> The reaction's intensity is accelerating by the day. We may win the fight against the Legion only to lose something very dear to us.

Is this a portent of some greater upheaval to come? What fate awaits our world, <name>?

I will seek answers at my forge, as I have done all my life. Your answers, I suspect, lie elsewhere.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Champion: Duke Hydraxis <|obj|> Lord Neptulon has sent me to aid the Earthen Ring in the defense of Azeroth.  <|text|> Lord Neptulon has sent me to aid the Earthen Ring in the defense of Azeroth. I have been commanded to serve the Farseer of the Earthen Ring with the same loyalty I give to the Lord of Tides. I will fulfill this duty until the Burning Legion is driven from this world and the future of Azeroth is secured. I am yours to command, Farseer.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Andron's Payment to Jediga <|obj|> Deliver Andron's Note to Jediga in Azshara.  <|text|> Here. . . take. . . <hic> this to Jediga. Good luck to ya!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Smash the Pumpkin <|obj|> Give the Scorched Holy Symbol to the Masked Orphan Matron.  <|text|> This large jack-o'-lantern rests in the middle of the village.  It eyes those who look upon it, betraying a dark menace within. Smashing the pumpking reveals an old, scorched holy symbol.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Thunderhorn Cleansing <|obj|> Use the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem at the Thunderhorn Water Well, then return to Mull.  <|text|> The totem is ready, <name>.  And again, it is your task to perform the ritual of cleansing. Go to the Thunderhorn Water Well, north of the village, and use the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem in your ritual.  After you do this, return to me. May the spirits guide you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Saving the Best for Last <|obj|> Give Deliana your Magister's Crown and Magister's Robes.  <|text|> That's an amazing story, <name>! You have my thanks, and the heartfelt gratitude of all who were involved. Now maybe I'll be able to sleep at night with both eyes shut. As to your reward, I believe I have a few things that you'll really enjoy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Strong as a Tiger <|obj|> Train the recipe for Charbroiled Tiger Steak from the Master of the Grill, then give him 5 Charbroiled Tiger Steaks.  <|text|> With the grill, you can transform those raw tiger steaks into food that makes you stronger. Learn the recipe for charbroiled tiger steaks from me. Show me what you can do.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Ape Hunter's Slave <|obj|> Kill 8 Hardknuckle Foragers and 6 Hardknuckle Chargers for High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill.  <|text|> You think you so great hunter, eh? You no Frenzyheart, you not know of hunt. Goregek is great ape hunter. He slay so many ape you can't count on claws. You go with Goregek and hunt hardknuckles to east. You the slave, <race>. You do what Goregek tell you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Scourge on our Perimeter <|obj|> Kill 8 undead outside of Deathknell.  <|text|> If you're going to be an asset to the Forsaken, you need to learn how to fight.  And there's no better target than the Scourge minions that continue to pester us. The wretched ghouls and Rattlecage skeletons that roam the north and to the east are former troopers of the fallen Scourge.  They should prove to be an even match for a fledgling <class> like you. Do not tarry - when you are done, speak to me again.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Task Unfinished <|obj|> Bring the Bundle of Furs to Innkeeper Kauth in Bloodhoof Village.  <|text|> <name>, please, I beg of you, can you help me? I have not finished my tasks here on the Mesa--I'm in the middle of my Rite of Strength--and my father asked me to deliver these furs to the inn in Bloodhoof. I'm far from rested enough to complete both my rite and this task for my father. Would you mind going on for me? The inn is pleasant and a perfect place to rest during your long travels. I'm sure you'll agree once you see it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mura Runetotem <|obj|> Speak with Mura Runetotem in the Sepulcher.  <|text|> My clanmate, Mura Runetotem, traveled to Silverpine so that she might aid our undead allies.  Silverpine is an ailing forest, a dying forest, and it was Mura's hope to bring it new life.  Perhaps the strange life found here in the Barrens can help her work in Silverpine. Take a sample of the shells you gathered, and bring it to Mura in Silverpine.  She is staying at the Sepulcher.  With luck, studying the shell will give her the insight she needs to heal that dying place.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Belt of Faith <|obj|> Father Inigo Montoy at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make a Belt of Faith if you bring him the following: 1 Desecrated Belt, 8 Wartorn Cloth Scraps, 2 Arcane Crystals and 2 Mooncloth.  <|text|> <Father Montoy makes some strange gestures in the air in front of you. >Blessed <boy/girl>, have you found the vestments of the fallen? The poor souls whose last breaths were taken on the field of battle - stripped of everything including their dignity. Bring me the desecrated remnants of the departed along with reagents of purification and you shall know faith.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Betrayal from Within <|obj|> Bring Lok's Skull to Thork at the Crossroads in the Barrens.  <|text|> Take Lok's head to Thork in the Crossroads, <race>. <snort> He should know what has happened to my tribe without any words--ha, not that he would believe Mangletooth helped in <snort> such things. But I am sure he'll reward you for carrying out such a great deed. <snort>I will continue to bless you with Agamaggan's power for as long as I remain in this cage, <race>. Until then, farewell.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> As the Crow Flies <|obj|> Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Stormcrow Amulet to explore the major lakes in Zangarmarsh.  <|text|> We must determine how widespread the naga's activity truly is and react accordingly. Exploring each body of water in Zangarmarsh could be a lengthy undertaking.  If you allow me to, I will use my magic to mold your shape to one more suited to scouting the marsh. Hold this amulet above the balcony near me when you're ready to begin.  I will guide your way back to safety after we're done.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hellfire Fortifications <|obj|> Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Battlecryer Blackeye in Thrallmar.  <|text|> The fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel must be scoured from our birthland!  To attack them, we must first secure forward staging points near the Citadel. Our outrunners found three fortifications that will suit this purpose, but the Alliance has the same idea and even now sends forces to take them! We want you to stop the Alliance and capture these forts.  Aid in the capture of each fort and then return to me. For the Horde!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Guardian of the Smallest <|obj|> Slay Great Mua'kin and return to the Glimmerfin Oracle.  <|text|> <The oracle pats you on the shoulder, and seems quite pleased with all that you've done.

She holds up one finger, then spreads her hands wide and emits a terrible roar-like murgle.

She points outside, then at you, then your weapon, then nods seriously.

There must be one more trial to await you. It would appear to be a test of strength. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> An Abyssal Opportunity <|obj|> Acquire 15 Abyssal Shards from Finder Pruc.  <|text|> I believe, <name>, we can use this thing to make our armor stronger. By redirecting its power, we can take the strength of our crafts to a new level. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. The first thing we need to do is repair this device. It'll require some powerful materials to fix it, and those are usually carried by the stronger creatures of this region. However, Finder Pruc is great at collecting materials like the ones we need. I'd check with him to see what he's got.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Only the Best Will Do <|obj|> Get everything needed to launch the expedition for Mechagon.  <|text|> You heard Gazlowe. The boss wants this expedition to go smoothly. No cutting corners, no slush.

I know you've worked with Gallywix in the past. We don't run our operations like that.

We expect the best from our crews, so we pay 'em what they're worth and treat 'em well. In return, we got the best goblin crews on the planet, and they ain't goin' over to any competition.

Here's a list of who and what we're gonna need to pull this off. Don't worry, Gazlowe'll cover all the costs.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Nezzliok Will Know <|obj|> Obtain Nezzliok's Head from Nezzliok the Dire in Zul'Kunda.  <|text|> Yenniku was not among the heads, and I thank the Great Serpent for it.  But we are no closer to finding him. We must know the truth, and I fear that only the Bloodscalp witchdoctor will know it.  He is an enemy of the Darkspear tribe and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from his dead lips! Bring me the head of Nezzliok the Dire and place it within this cauldron. He is deep within Zul'Kunda.  Bring his head. . . we will then make it talk.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trouble at the Underlight Mines <|obj|> Slay 8 Blackpaw Gnolls, 6 Blackpaw Scavengers and 4 Blackpaw Shaman, and return to Deathstalker Maltendis at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.  <|text|> The Underlight Mines to the southwest have been overrun by a clan of gnolls calling themselves the Blackpaw. I don't need to remind you how important those mines are to us as a strategic asset in our ongoing campaign here in the Ghostlands! Take the south road out of town and follow the fork to the right. Just past the ziggurat on the right there will be a short dirt path to the west. Follow it. The ore must flow!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Instructor Razuvious Must Die!  <|obj|> Kill Instructor Razuvious.  <|text|> Instructor Razuvious smugly struts about the Military Quarter of Naxxramas. It is said that only a death knight personally trained by him could possibly even withstand the prowess of his blade. You and your group are going to prove everyone wrong. The Council of Six has decreed that Razuvious must die!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Gryphon Master Talonaxe <|obj|> Speak with Gryphon Master Talonaxe inside the Aerie Peak Aviary.  <|text|> So you're a glorified errand <boy/girl> for some old Explorers' League geezer, eh? Well you listen to me, <class>. I don't know who your old buddy was flying around with down in Azeroth. Do I look like Gryphon Master Talonaxe to you? Do I? If you're so interested in the flight assignments why don't you ask the gryphon master? If I catch you idling around here for much longer, I'm going to put you to some real work. Now get a move on.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dousing the Flames of Protection <|obj|> Using the Purified Moon Well Water, douse the flames of the four braziers of protection within Shadow Hold in Felwood, then return to Greta Mosshoof in the Emerald Sanctuary.  <|text|> Now, you must return to Jaedenar. The braziers are more than likely spread throughout Shadow Hold. Douse each of their flames and the protections the Council has set up will fall for at least a short period of time. I will be waiting for that to happen. When it does, I will look deep within the Hold and try to find out who the head of this beast is. Then, and only then, will we see about attacking them directly.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trail of Filth <|obj|> Kill Chet the Slime-Breeder.  <|text|> The trail of filth and anger leads into the ruined town hall. Surely there is a slime breeding pool inside the structure. Fight your way inside and deal with whatever angry slime-breeder that you encounter! Should you succeed Serge Hinott at the Ruins of Southshore will surely want to hear about it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Destiny Unfulfilled <|obj|> Witness True Betrayal in Shadowmoon Valley on the fringes of Outland.  <|text|> Hardly recognizable from the golden eyed child of prophecy, and living as an outcast on the fringes of a shattered world, his motivation remained unchanged. His assaults on the Legion and his attempts to end their march were his only focus. Yet, in a strange twist of fate, it was not the Burning Legion who came for him in the end. We must travel to Outland to experience Illidan's last memory.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Search Continues <|obj|> Search for the Menethil Statuette.  <|text|> You thoroughly search this cluster of murloc hovels, and find no trace of the Menethil statuette. Perhaps one of the two nearby hovels to the north and northeast will have more clues.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Thalyssra's Estate <|obj|> Meet with Lady Liadrin at the Estate of the First Arcanist in Suramar.  <|text|> Would you like to hear how the nightborne came to join the Horde?

We earned their trust when we aided them in liberating Suramar from the tyranny of Grand Magistrix Elisande and the Burning Legion.

Lor'themar Theron later asked them to join him in Quel'Thalas. Lady Liadrin made the journey to extend the invitation to First Arcanist Thalyssra. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Stromgarde Badges <|obj|> Bring Stromgarde Badges to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe.  <|text|> The Syndicate in Stromgarde do battle with our contingent of militia there. In order to urge the rabble to fight our more disciplined troops, the Syndicate leaders have placed a bounty on our soldiers, awarding gold for each Stromgarde Badge gathered off killed militiamen. We want those badges retrieved - we cannot allow the cutthroats to take trophies from our brave fallen! Enter the Syndicate-controlled area of Stromgarde and hunt them for our badges.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Call Down the Thunder <|obj|> Use Aetherion's Ritual Orb and obtain Aetherion's Essence.  <|text|> Aetherion is almost in our world, but he can still be dealt with! At the end of the dock floats a ritual orb. I want you to use it to complete the ritual, beckoning the elemental lord down from his vortex. Trust me, <name>, I and the other spirits that you have freed will greatly weaken Aetherion. However, it will be up to you to finish him off for good and save the Kaldorei people of Darkshore from utter destruction. Deliver his essence to Corvine Moonrise at the refugee camp so he will know.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Fellow Gearhead <|obj|> Find Thaelin Darkanvil in the Iron Siegeworks.  <|text|> There's no way Thaelin sold out. NO way! They gotta be holdin' him here somewhere. Come on, $p. I know he's with the Alliance, and I know they aren't your favorite people, but we do NOT want the Iron Horde having access to his work - trust me!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Those Who Hesitate <|obj|> Talk to Initiate Oman in the Darkmoon Faire.  <|text|> Hm.

There is one who has been counted amongst our number, but is not here.

The Draenei.

< Madam Shadow inhales. >

I can taste the Light about him. Go, see to it that he rejoins us.

There is much work to be done.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Brotherhood's End <|obj|> Speak with Baros Alexston in Stormwind.  <|text|> Ah, I almost forgot. Alexston came while you were away, he wished to speak with you. No doubt he wishes to report the goings-on of the Defias Brotherhood to the nobles. A bit of advice, <name>: if anyone should ask, I would provide all details but that it was your hand that slew Lescovar. Trust me. I am. . . acquainted. . . with the ways of such things. And as far as Trias goes, well, speak to no one of him. . . ever. . . if you can help it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ready to Go <|obj|> Speak to Gwen Armstead in Duskhaven.  <|text|> I suppose now is as good a time to leave as any. I have my best outfit, my favorite book and my loving cat. I hope I'm not forgetting anything. Tell that mayor of yours that I'll be on my way.  I suppose I'll see you in town with the others!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Doom and Gloom <|obj|> Recover the ingredients Ernest needs to create an Elixir of Suspension.  <|text|> Doom curses are serious business, so much so that many warlocks didn't deal in them for some time. 

The magic grows stronger as time goes on, eventually leading to death. Only the caster of the curse can remove it.

I can craft an elixir that will slow its progression, but you'll need to collect an assortment of ingredients first.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rider on the Storm <|obj|> Use the Raging Vortex Gem at Nijel's Point Ruin.  <|text|> You cannot help but to feel a twinge of pride, having unlocked this long lost secret of the ancient worshippers of Elune. You now possess the power to inflict great damage upon your enemy. As it was Furien's tireless work that made this possible, it only seems right that the weapon should be unleashed upon those who took his life. The Alliance scum at Nijel's Point shall pay for their offenses against the Horde!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Daggerfen Deviance <|obj|> Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers.  <|text|> The Kurenai and the draenei don't always see eye to eye, particularly on the issue of the Lost Ones. We are content to help the Lost Ones who seek us out, but we won't pursue them. Some draenei are intent on 'redeeming' them all. However, there are times when even the Lost Ones go too far, such as the Daggerfen. In their village to the west, they dabble in poisons and deceit, arts that come unnaturally to us. We must put an end to this before the vile Daggerfen can extend their influence.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bet On Yourself <|obj|> Defeat Ti'or in the Theater of Pain, when she appears.  <|text|> Dear Maw Walker. . . my friend. . . you're going to lose. Everyone knows you can't compete in the arena. 

The entire Challenger's Promenade knows it, the brokers in Oribos know it, even Zo'umlo knows it.

I've brought in a special challenger just to prove the point. Face Ti'or in the Theater of Pain and prove us wrong. . . or prove us right.

We will be betting, so don't disappoint.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Don't Stop Now. . . .  <|obj|> Smith Hauthaa in Sun's Reach Armory wants you to kill Darkspine Myrmidon to the east and use their keys to steal three pieces of the ore from their chests.  <|text|> Now that we have an anvil, I can really get to work. No matter how many supplies we receive, I'll always be able to put the Darkspine Iron Ore to good use. We'll need a constant supply of weapons and armor if we're to be successful here. There are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here. They're collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion. Relieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one. . . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bones That Walk <|obj|> Commander Althea Ebonlocke of Darkshire wants you to kill 5 Skeletal Warriors and 5 Skeletal Mages.  <|text|> There's even fouler undead left to deal with, <name>. Tranquil Gardens Cemetery, further south of town, is a place you don't want to be caught in at night. The bones that rise from the ground there are cunning enough to remember how to swing an axe or cast a spell. I shouldn't need to explain how dangerous that makes them. Proceed with caution, but remember the people of Darkshire that will suffer if you falter.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Path to Payback <|obj|> Guard Captain Zorek at Valgarde in Howling Fjord wants you to recover the Harpoon Operation Manual.  <|text|> Two weeks ago our chief engineer got his hands on a vrykul harpoon gun - the same type of gun that the vrykul use to take down our ships. By studying that gun he managed to put together a comprehensive operation manual. Unfortunately he was abducted and taken north of here to Wyrmskull Village. We eventually did find him, but near death and without the manual. His dying words indicated that the manual was lost in the Utgarde Catacombs, located at the northwest end of Wyrmskull. Get me that manual!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ember Court: Mushroom Surprise!  <|obj|> Collect 18 Feather Caps, 24 Lacy Bell Morels, and 4 Violet Frills.  <|text|> I had not realized the fame of my fungi had reached so far. I'd be delighted to provide a mushroom feast to the Ember Court!

Hmmm. . . I will need you to collect some rare specimens and will loan you my favorite foraging bag. It will help you find the very best fungi. It's never failed me.

Let's see, I need tiny lacy bells from Bastion and some of those Ardenweald fancy purple frills. From the very tops of our mushrooms here I will need the feather caps. You'll need to grapple your way up there.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Kobold Fury!  <|obj|> Use the Kobold War Horn near the Horde Banner at the Unearthed Grounds to unleash the Kobold Army! A level 10 Stonetalon Mountains Quest.  <|text|> We now command the kobold armies of Stonetalon! It almost sounds impressive. Almost. <Devo sighs. >The Alliance base camp north of here is tightly guarded. It is nigh impregnable, save for the entry point by the Unearthed Grounds, northeast of here. Take this kobold war horn and head towards the Unearthed Grounds. Enter from the east, <name>! Once there, head west until you arrive at the location I have marked upon your map. Use the horn there to unleash kobold fury upon the Alliance!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> I'm the Boss!  <|obj|> Assist Belastrasza.  <|text|> Never have I met such a bossy child!

She has a list. A list! Please, take Belastrasza off our claws for a bit. I just. . . I need to sit down.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Defense of Grom'gol <|obj|> Commander Aggro'gosh of the Grom'gol base camp wants you to kill 15 Lashtail Raptors.  <|text|> Throm'ka, <class>! Your arrival at Grom'gol is timely, indeed.  As commander of the Warchief's base camp here in the jungle I am bound by honor to ensure the safety of all members of the Horde.  Our mission to provide a safe chain of supply to Stonard is being hampered by some of the local inhabitants. I am putting you in charge of thinning out the raptor population outside of Grom'gol.  Once you have made significant progress, report back to me for reassignment.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Raw Clefthoof Meat <|obj|> I remember reading that the old orc clans of Draenor used to prize the clefthoof for its size - one kill could feed a village for a night.  <|text|> Look at that mountain of meat. You have done the Alliance proud, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Full of Surprises <|obj|> Locate Zovaal's Vault.  <|text|> You continue to surprise me Maw Walker, your presence here is most unexpected!

Since we are both here, I believe we should work together.

The Jailer has a vault full of valuables, somewhere in this rift.  Locate it for me, or bring it here to be opened and we'll share the wealth together!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Long Knives <|obj|> Talk to Kaltunk in the Valley of Trials.  <|text|> Is that you, <name>? Look at how much you've grown! But why are you here? They've sent you to deal with Gor'krosh? Thank the ancestors!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trolls Is Gone Crazy!  <|obj|> Chief Rageclaw at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak wants you to use the Drakuru "Lock Openers" found on various Drakuru trolls to free 8 Captured Rageclaw.  <|text|> Drakuru. . . You know who this troll is? I think bad troll are controlled by the Drakuru troll. They call themself Drakuru trolls - that how I know. Now you see why I am chief of Rageclaw. Smartest of all wolvar! But that not why I talk to you now. Bad troll come and kick Rageclaw out of den. Rageclaw that no run away held as prisoner in village. You go to Rageclaw Den, southeast, and free captured Rageclaw. Kill troll for lock opener. You maybe kill many troll for many lock opener.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Might of Kalimdor <|obj|> A thousand years has passed and just as it was fated, one stands before me.  <|text|> A thousand years has passed and just as it was fated, one stands before me. One who shall lead their people to a new age. The Old God trembles, <name>. Oh yes, it fears your faith. Shatter the prophecy of C'Thun. It knows you come, champion - and with you comes the might of Kalimdor. You have only to let me know when you are prepared and I shall grant you the Scepter of the Shifting Sands.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Balance of Power <|obj|> Absorb the combined power of the Nightshards and the Eye of Gul'dan using the Heart of Zin-Azshari at the Lunar Crucible.  <|text|> At long last, it is time to reap the fruits of your labors. Lothrius tells of a place deep in the former Moonguard Stronghold used to infuse new Guards with immense power. It will be the perfect place to tap into and augment the power of the Nightshards you gathered. Gather your effects and meet me there when you are ready, and we will use the Heart to finally reveal the great power within your artifact.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?  <|obj|> Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.  <|text|> We haven't heard from the druids at the Cenarion Thicket of Terokkar Forest in quite some time. <name>, I'd like for you to go down there and check in with them to see what's happening.  There are several ways to get there, but the fastest is to head south along the path, and then take the road that branches east from Shattrath City once you're in the forest.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Final Exit <|obj|> Use the Rune of Opening to unlock the Empyrean Society building door.  <|text|> We've certainly reduced the Empyrean Society's numbers. I don't think they'll be luring any more members to their cause for a while. 

There's only one place we haven't investigated, and I suspect that rune we found is attuned to the door. Let's see what's inside the building.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> An Embarrassing Incident <|obj|> Look for Vic's Keys inside the lake at River's Heart.  <|text|> There's one little problem we have to solve before we head out.  You see, I can't seem to find the keys to my flying machine. I've looked pretty much everywhere for them. . . maybe you can give me a hand.  Only place I haven't looked yet is inside the lake. I'll even give you my very own air tank.  It's almost empty, but it's got a couple of hits left.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Undersea Inflation <|obj|> Fill one of Sambino's Air Balloons and find his Lost Air Valve.  <|text|> Fine! Fine. You argued me into it. You can help. I'm leaking air worse than a zeppelin stuffed with quilboar! My air valve must have come loose somewhere in the trench. I brought spare air balloons - make yourself useful and go fill one up, will ya? And find my valve! I'll need that too. I bet the crabs snatched it up. . . pinchy, greedy little things.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Demon Souls <|obj|> Trap 8 demon souls on the Faronaar Front.  <|text|> I need to extract information about the Burning Legion from these foul creatures. But living, the demons are almost impossible to break.

However, like you, I wield a powerful artifact -- the Scythe of Souls.

Take one of my soul gems. If you place it next to a demon's corpse, it will rip the 'soul' out. Then, we will see if the scythe can get them to talk.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Meet the High Tinker <|obj|> Introduce yourself to High Tinker Mekkatorque in New Tinkertown.  <|text|> I don't know if you'll remember Mekkatorque or not. Nevin tells me that memory loss is pretty common for a Gnomeregan survivor. Mekkatorque, or more properly, the High Tinker Mekkatorque is the leader of all the gnomes. He has made a habit of meeting with every rescued survivor personally. You should introduce yourself to him. He'll be with his war council beneath the tent in the center of town.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Continued Incubation <|obj|> Collect 10 Crystallized Void in areas under assault by N'Zoth's forces.  <|text|> The egg is doing well, but we're going to need more of those void crystals to keep it healthy.

Could you go out and gather some?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> First Contact <|obj|> Speak with Vanthir in The Grand Promenade.  <|text|> Time to put your new disguise to the test. Your first contact is Vanthir, a merchant from the common district. He is in the Grand Promenade today visiting one of his suppliers. Tell Vanthir to pay me a visit regarding a shipment of dusk lily bulbs. He will understand. Beyond that, we will need time to prepare. You should return to Thalyssra. <Ly'leth hands you a corked bottle of faintly glowing fluid. >Give her this, with my regards. We will call upon you soon.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Needs of the Hunters <|obj|> Speak with Emmarel Shadewarden in Dalaran.  <|text|> The eagle appears to have a message for you: To: <name>The time has come to strike back at the Legion. Meet me at Hunter's Reach in Dalaran as soon as you can. - Emmarel Shadewarden <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> No Mere Dream <|obj|> Protect Clintar Dreamwalker's Spirit while it gathers the relics of Aviana, then speak to Dreamwarden Lurosa.  <|text|> <Clintar listens as you relay Morthis' instructions, nodding, but clearly fearful. >I cannot extricate myself fully from the Emerald Dream to help you, but a fragment of my spirit will guide you in your search for the relics. Guard it well, <race>, for it is a fragile thing. The Emerald Dream itself has become an alien, dangerous place. Its grasp on me is strong, and I will not be whole until the Emerald Dream returns to normalcy. What you see around you is but an echo of the reality inside the dream!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Gallon of Blood <|obj|> You have the option of offering larger quantities of the blood taken from our enemies.  <|text|> The blood of our enemies has been shed. I shall mix this blood with the rest that has been gathered. Once the offering is complete, the Ice Lord shall show these Stormpike dogs the full wrath of the Frostwolf Clan!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> In the Hall of the Mountain-Lord <|obj|> Speak with Mountain-Lord Rendan at Iron Summit in Searing Gorge.  <|text|> The Thorium Brotherhood doesn't maintain a militia - just a few guards, and me, and that's it.  If we're to successfully strike against the Dark Irons of the gorge, we're gonna need help. Mountain-Lord Rendan sits atop that tower across the gorge, to our south.  He doesn't consort with Twilight folks or fire elementals, but he hasn't joined the brotherhood either.  Maybe it's time we paid him a visit.  With his help, we might just stand a chance.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> An Earnest Proposition <|obj|> Acquire 15 Silithus Venom Samples and 20 gold and bring them along with a set of Magister's Bindings to Mokvar in Orgrimmar.  <|text|> Hail, <class>!  I can tell by your demeanor that you've seen and done much in this world.  Yet I'm willing to wager you haven't seen a piece of armor like this. Perform a small favor for me and I'll be willing to trade it to you for an ordinary set of bracers. I'm in need of a sizeable sample of venom drawn from the spiders and scorpions that inhabit Silithus.  Bring this to me along with a few gold coins and I'll perform the exchange.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Yowler Must Die!  <|obj|> Kill Yowler and recover the Blackrock Invasion Plans.  <|text|> <The gnomecorder hums. >You need to find Yowler, <name>.

Should you succeed, bring the plans to me over at the town hall in Lakeshire. Solomon, out.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Taking Back Taurajo <|obj|> Kill 8 Taurajo Looters in the ruins of Taurajo.  <|text|> Outstanding work at the gates, <name>! The main body of the Alliance force is in general retreat. But I'm not satisfied. They sacked Taurajo, which was little more than a hunters' camp. This 'Alliance' is unmasked at last for what it really is: A renegade band of butchers. Even now a group of humans linger behind to pick at the bones of smouldering Taurajo. <Bloodhilt hurls an axe into the dirt. >Make them suffer.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dadanga is Hungry!  <|obj|> Dadanga looks up at you as you approach her.  <|text|> Placing the sprouts in front of her, Dadanga seems pleased. She nudges a small brown-wrapped package towards you, in exchange for the treat!  <|endoftext|>

Can you accompany me to make sure things stay on the level?

<|startoftext|> Assault on Shattrath Harbor <|obj|> Assault the Sargerei forces at Shattrath City in Talador.  <|text|> Shattrath City is in the hands of Sargerei forces under the leadership of the once Exarch, Socrethar.

<|startoftext|> Return to Karazhan: Book Wyrms <|obj|> Clean up the Karazhan Library.  <|text|> My incorporeal condition has allowed me to enter the tower safely for the first time. I must say, it's a bit of a shambles in there! I could use some help tackling my cleaning checklist. We should start with the library. All those musty tomes are bound to attract mana wyrms! Please shelve any books that have fallen to the floor, or worse, taken flight. And if you find mana wyrms nibbling at the pages. . . step on them!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Aberrations of Bone <|obj|> Kill Rattlegore in the Ossuary of Scholomance.  <|text|> In life, my brothers and I fought against all the forces of the Scourge, but none were so reviled as the necromancers. It was not enough for them raise our dead comrades and send them against us; no, they created twisted golems of bone with scythes for hands. These aberrations slew many of my brothers, and yet we could not destroy them all. I ask you, <name>, to carry on the task of the fallen. Venture into the Ossuary of Scholomance and slay the largest and most dangerous of these abominable creatures.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mazen's Behest <|obj|> Speak with Acolyte Dellis in Stormwind.  <|text|> As caretaker of the works here in the library of the Academy of Arcane Arts and Sciences, it is my responsibility to ensure all the magical tomes and scrolls are accounted for at all times. Who knows what folly would unfold if some of these enchanted texts were to fall into the wrong hands? Which reminds me. . . my assistant, Dellis, made a horrible mistake last week. He's quite able in the library but incompetent when he leaves the gates of Stormwind. Be a hero, and help old Dellis out, would you?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Neltharion's Legacy <|obj|> Meet Nozdormu in Valdrakken.  <|text|> <As you stare into the cracked titan gem, a voice echoes through your mind. >

The time to redeem the legacy of your creator, Neltharion, is at hand. 

You hold a vital piece to the artifact Neltharion once used to control you and all of the dracthyr.

Meet me in Valdrakken. There is much to discuss.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Back to the Elementium Depths <|obj|> Speak with Initiate Goldmine at the Elementium Depths in the Twilight Highlands.  <|text|> The Earthcaller has a goblin initiate?

<|startoftext|> Punting Season <|obj|> Punt 5 Children of Tortolla into water.  <|text|> Baby turtles are sweet, even if they can be somewhat bitey. < Mylune holds up a bandaged finger. >But they're so slow with their tiny little legs, they can't escape the fire creatures who are attacking Hyjal! < Mylune claps her hands together. >PLEASE save them, <name>! Pick up the wee turtles and punt them into the water of the Ashen Lake. Don't worry about the kicking, they have hard shells. They also have hard teeth, so don't pick them up by the mouth.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Simple Plan <|obj|> Hear Mathias Shaw's plan and then cast your vote.  <|text|> Like many dreadlords, Detheroc cannot help but gloat. He was careless and I overheard many of his plans while I was held captive.

With your leave, I would like to underscore the gravity of the situation in Stormwind. The fate of Azeroth hangs in the balance.

But for all of that, I have a simple plan: get 'em.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Core Access Codes <|obj|> Obtain the Core Access Codes from Twizzleflux the Insane.  <|text|> The expedition's numbers are extremely large, user <name>. Dealing with them by conventional means would take you an estimated 2, 700, 136. 5 hours. We can make use of a powerful source of energy held within expedition's crawler vehicle. We will need the fusion core's access codes to accomplish this. Mekgineer Twizzleflux has these codes and can be found at the Starwatch Tower to the southeast. I've uploaded jamming frequencies to a scrambler.  Use it to temporarily disable Twizzleflux's defenses.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Nar'thalas Almanac <|obj|> Have you brought something to add to our collection? A level 20 Quest.  <|text|> Thank you, <name>. Our knowledge expands through your efforts. If you discover more magical works that might benefit the library, please bring them to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Power over Poison <|obj|> Return to Mathrengyl Bearwalker in the Cenarion Enclave, Darnassus.  <|text|> You've learned what it means to cure poison without the benefit of spiritual aid.  Remember what others must endure in fighting poisonous afflictions as you soon embrace your newfound power over poison. You should now return to Mathrengyl Bearwalker in Darnassus, <name>.  He, no doubt, has a very important spell to teach you now that the student understands the lesson given unto <him/her>. Farewell, young druid.  We shall speak again.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Last Conflict <|obj|> Subdue the restless spirits of Malygos and Sindragosa within the Azure Vault.  <|text|> Malygos and myself both suffered horribly violent ends. The remains of our essences have been trapped in an endless loop.

They must be reformed, and broken out of that loop. To do so will require a tremendous amount of concentrated power.

We will have to utilize every amount of arcane energy within the Azure Archives. . . along with all of the assembled blue dragons.

It is the only chance we have to reform these spirits. . . and to put an end to their suffering.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Solving the Mystery <|obj|> Bring the Mysterious Challenge Card to Bizmo's Brawlpub to confront Bizmo's captor.  <|text|> < Bizmo produces a challenge card from his pocket. >

<|startoftext|> Redeeming the Dead <|obj|> Take the Filled Shimmering Vessel to Silvermoon City's inn and use its magic to resurrect Sangrias Stillblade.  <|text|> While you were preparing the vessel, I sent a group of initiates to retrieve Sangrias Stillblade. You will find him on the top level of Silvermoon's inn with an attendant. Make your way there with all haste and unleash the vessel's magic to restore him to life. Time is of the essence, <name>.

<|startoftext|> Playing to Their Strengths <|obj|> Assign new roles to Micah Broadhoof, Boss Mida, and Nomi.  <|text|> Iltheux isn't properly utilizing the help he's been given.

Let's fix that.

Assign new roles to the workers, ones more suited to their strengths.

If you need suggestions, I'm happy to help.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Life's Finer Pleasures <|obj|> Just because we're on this pilgrimage doesn't mean we have to give up all of life's pleasures.  <|text|> You know, maybe we can become friends after all.  Follow me; we don't want to have to share this with the others now, do we? See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(9483)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Judgment at the Eye of Eternity <|obj|> Krasus atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight wants you to return with the Heart of Magic.  <|text|> Now that you have access to the focusing iris it's time to put that key to use. As much as I would like to see Malygos brought back into the fold, that's just not going to happen at this point. With everything that's at stake, it is the judgment of the other Dragon Aspects that the Spell-Weaver needs to be put down. < Krasus says this last with a great deal of trepidation. ><name>, travel to the Eye of Eternity, confront Malygos and return with the Heart of Magic.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Undercover Security <|obj|> Collect The Everyday Assassin training guide from Maldraxxus and 20 Enchanted Trickster Dust from Ardenweald.  <|text|> Do you know why the venthyr carve stoneborn into different shapes?

Because diversity in form allows for diversity in strategy. Our different shapes give us different purpose.

We need a new shape to solidify our court defenses.

With the right training and tools, venthyr guards could be hidden in plain sight--posed as greeters.

Able to be among the guests without raising concerns, they'd be the first to respond to active threats.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Singing Crystals <|obj|> Bring 3 Pulsing Blue Shards to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp.  <|text|> Legends tell of a jewel, hidden deep in the heart of Stranglethorn.  We call it the Mind's Eye, and it has great powers.  If you gain this Eye then, perhaps, we can use it to bring lost Yenniku back from the darkness. I will consult with the spirits of the jungle to find the Mind's Eye.  While I do this, you enter the Crystalvein Mine, southeast of here, and gather Pulsing Blue Shards from Ironjaw Basilisks.  The shards are rare, but we will need their magic to bend the Mind's Eye to our will.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Inspiring Ashran <|obj|> Speak with Narnin Dawnglow, Beska Redtusk, and Zarjhin.  <|text|> I hope you will find our facilities to be up to your high standards. This inn is run by Narnin Dawnglow, in my opinion this is the best place to hearth in Draenor. We have new recruits coming through the portal daily. In fact one of out latest recruits, Zarjhin, just came through the portal today. If you are looking for weapons or armor Beska Redtusk will be happy to help.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fel Tanning <|obj|> Craft a pair of bracers for Stalriss using the tanning rack.  <|text|> Listen, you.

Follow my instructions and you'll have an excellent grasp on the procedures.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bloodfury Bloodline <|obj|> Maggran at Sun Rock Retreat wishes you to slay Bloodfury Ripper and bring her remains as proof of your deed.  <|text|> Limiting the number of Bloodfury Harpies will not be enough. The only true cure for their disease would be to slay their leader, Bloodfury Ripper! She is all but a queen to those filthy creatures. Slay her and their numbers will surely diminish. Go back into the Charred Vale and you will find her along the western hills. She will not be easy to vanquish, but the reward will be great.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Mourneblade Born <|obj|> Discuss the vision with Bolvar and the others.  <|text|> While his father was missing, I cared for Anduin like a son. To see him like that, at the mercy of Sylvanas. . .

<Bolvar's eyes flare with fire. >

Something must be done.

Take a moment. Let me know when you are ready to discuss what comes next.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Competition Schmompetition <|obj|> Recover 6 of Sputtervalve's Blueprints from Venture Co.  <|text|> I'm just a little guy, trying to set up my own independent business. Working hard toward the Azerothian dream, ya know? Well soon as I set up shop, the Venture Co. next door decided they wanted me out. They've been harrassing me with threatening letters, using words like 'cease' and 'desist. 'Worst of all, the schematics for my newest machine are missing, and I know those corporate pilferers stole them! Go to the Sludge Fen and knock out some of their employees. I know they're hiding my blueprints!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Master of Silkweave <|obj|> Purchase a Shal'dorei Mannequin from Leyweaver Mithrogane, then craft an entire set of silkweave armor and place them on the mannequin.  <|text|> While Tytallo is busy exacting withered genocide, it falls on me to take care of the more mundane aspects of training. We're going to need to see how talented you are. Craft an entire set of silkweave armor for me. Leyweaver Mithrogane can provide you with a proper mannequin for displaying it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Make the Bad Snake Go Away <|obj|> High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to kill Venomtip and 10 Emperor Cobras.  <|text|> We were here long before the puppy-men came.

There snakes thing that keeps trying to eat our hatchlings. Go with Lafoo and make them stop, okay? Especially big one near waterfall to northeast.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> We Are Coming <|obj|> Inform Ralston Karn to prepare for the assault on Darkshore.  <|text|> We must press our advantage before the Horde can further its hold on Darkshore.

The kaldorei stand ready to fight for our home, and the Gilneans stand alongside us.

We will show our enemies our fury. They will learn to fear us.

Rally any you can. We march at once.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Focusing Our Efforts <|obj|> Complete the "Nightfall" and "Moon Guard Stronghold" storylines in Suramar, then meet Archmage Kalec in Shal'Aran.  <|text|> The Nightfallen in Suramar were once a part of the Nightborne, but have been exiled by their former brethren and cut off from the Nightwell. I believe they could be valuable allies in our quest if you can turn them to our side. I know only that they have gone into hiding somewhere in Suramar. Afterward, seek out the Moon Guard in the northern reaches of Suramar. They, too, could be valuable allies in our cause. . . if they still oppose the Legion as they once did many years ago.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Heritage of Highmountain <|obj|> Meet Mayla Highmountain in Thunder Totem.  <|text|> Your sojourn through Azeroth has been long, $p. And through it all, you have brought honor to Highmountain.

Now Thunder Totem calls you home. It is time we thank you for all that you have done for us.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Team Carry <|obj|> Collect 4 heavy lumber and take it to the drop-off point.  <|text|> Algerson is about as useful as a legless horse. We're going to do this ourselves.

The mill is overrun with bizarre creatures. I'll handle those. You and these hearty volunteers will need to be the muscle of this operation.

Don't look at me like that, <class>. It's just a little lifting.

Once we have enough lumber, Sal will meet us for a pick up. Just stay close to me and focus on not dropping my wood, yes?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Talk to Swar'jan <|obj|> Deliver the Gordunni Orb to Swar'jan in Stonemaul Hold.  <|text|> We're lucky and unlucky here, grunt. Lucky that I had you bother to bring this back, and unlucky that my suspicions turned out to hold water. This thing's full of corrupted stench. It's far too new to be something fished out of the ruins, either. Someone is supplying these ogres, and we need to know who before this becomes a situation. Get that filthy thing upstairs to Swar'jan, the warlock on top of the guard tower. He's good for a few ideas; I'd listen to his suggestions, if I were you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cutting Teeth <|obj|> Kill 8 Mottled Boars then return to Gornek at the Den.  <|text|> The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead. I believe you would find a good match with the mottled boars you'll find to the north of here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To the Broken Shore <|obj|> Head to the Broken Shore.  <|text|> It would seem that Kanrethad's twisted followers have begun their ritual on the Broken Shore. We must act quickly.

<|startoftext|> The Eve of Battle <|obj|> Speak with Mathias Shaw.  <|text|> <name>. The time has come.

We may have defeated Azshara, but we still have to deal with Sylvanas. Though our position is not ideal, we have mobilized our available forces and stand ready to finish this war.

<|startoftext|> Assault: The Black Empire <|obj|> Drive back the N'Zoth Assault in Uldum.  <|text|> It is just as the visions fortold. Dark forces have come to claim the Forge of Origination.

They must be stopped, or all of Azeroth will meet its end!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Through the Fire and Flames <|obj|> Reach the Standing Stone.  <|text|> Margrave Krexus was pleased to hear of your service to our house. He senses great potential within you.

Potential that must be tested.

A stone stands at the center of our citadel, surrounded by magma. Reaching the stone is a challenge of endurance and fortitude.

This trial is usually attempted only by our most renowned soldiers, but Margrave Krexus commands you to attempt the rite at once.

Go on, then. Prove your worth.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Soothing Turtle Bisque <|obj|> Bring 10 pieces of Turtle Meat to Christoph Jeffcoat in Tarren Mill.  <|text|> Who says that the undead don't know anything about cooking? Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks that would come back from the dead just to enjoy a bowl! Heh, heh. . . Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately.  I used to head over to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt snapjaws, the nasty things, but I can't pull myself away from my work here. If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the snapjaws, I'll show you how it's done!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Making Contact <|obj|> Observe as Earthmender Duarn attempts to communicate with Nespirah.  <|text|> I can't believe that Nespirah would willingly allow these naga to take residence inside her shell.  As I see it, one of two things has happened: they have convinced her to willingly join their cause, or they have weakened her to a point where she cannot fight back.  Either one is bad. Here in this chamber, I should be able to communicate directly with Nespirah.  Let us find out for ourselves.  Speak to me when you are prepared, <class>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Lieutenant Paval Reethe <|obj|> Bring Reethe's Badge to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore.  <|text|> A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble.

Underneath the anchor is embossed the name "Lieutenant Paval Reethe".  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Monster Hunting <|obj|> Search for clues and tracks to learn more about the worldeater.  <|text|> Make ready, <class>. We hunt a worldeater.

They are the largest of devourers, massive beings who can drain anima from an entire region within a matter of moments. 

With Ardenweald suffering from the drought, a worldeater's presence could prove disastrous.

Still, we must not rush into battle without first understanding our prey. Tread the Elder Stand with me. Even creatures such as these leave spoor.

Knowing our quarry will be what allows us to slay it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> For Posterity <|obj|> Chronicler Bah'Kini at Dubra'Jin wants you to enter Gundrak and collect 6 Drakkari History Tablets.  <|text|> Gundrak be doomed, mon. History be repeatin' itself before our eyes. When trolls be turnin' on their own gods, the end be certain. It just be a matter of time. Perhaps if we can record the events clearly, we might prevent future generations from traveling down da same path. If you be havin' the courage, enter Gundrak and search for clues to what brought the Drakkari Empire to such an end as dis.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Corastrasza <|obj|> Librarian Serrah wants you to speak to Corastrasza in Coldarra.  <|text|> Greetings, <class>. Might I impose on you for a favor?

<|startoftext|> In Skilled Hands <|obj|> Bring the Shado-Pan Crossbow Bolt Bundle to Hawkmaster Nurong.  <|text|> <name>, take these crossbow bolts and then bring them to Hawkmaster Nurong at Farwatch Overlook to the southwest. Nurong is praised among all the Wukao for being a flawless shot. His efforts are credited with holding the line here for these many months. I'm hoping you can work with him and judge for yourself. He may be the final Shado-Pan we need for the hunt.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Freehold <|obj|> Use Flynn's Spyglass.  <|text|> Well, there she is: Freehold.

You can get anything you want there, provided you can pay for it.

<|startoftext|> In the Land of Magic <|obj|> Speak to Al'Abas.  <|text|> I think I see the problem. Your puny eyes are too weak to detect the mana-infused finery that these elves have spread throughout the land. They've been wearing jewelry the entire time, and you simply couldn't see it.

I propose a partnership, my newly minted associate. My lamp currently suffers from an embarrassing lack of magic and could always use more beautiful decorations. I propose a trade. I shall pierce this sinister veil, and you shall give me the spoils of your theft.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> The Power of Worship <|obj|> Destroy 3 Arcane Energy Transmuters.  <|text|> I was once like them, stuck in a loop and waiting for Azshara to come and save me. Our spirits are locked to this place.

There are naga in the other parts of these ruins. They have these magical orbs. . . I think they are using us to fuel their arcane experiments. They draw power from our spirits and our worship of Azshara. This keeps us weakened and unable to break free.

Destroy the orbs. Breaking the connection will allow us to gain strength and move on.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> In Search of Knowledge <|obj|> Talk to Daryn Lightwind in Rut'theran Village.  <|text|> While the ruins of Feralas can be quite dangerous, they have much to tell of what has happened here. Searching through the rubble to the south a few days ago, I discovered what appears to be a normal stave. However, I just can't shake the feeling that there is something more to it. Angelas and I have been poring over our books here, but we can't find a thing about it. I have a colleague in Darnassus that may be able to tell us what this is, <name>. Why don't you go talk to her and see if she can help us?  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Vault of the Wardens: Bendy Glass Tubes <|obj|> Bring the Bendy Glass Tubes to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran.  <|text|> You find tubing formed from a bendable sort of glass. It appears as though Grimoira was using it to suck out the insides of her victims. Its magical properties, however, would seem ideal for use on an advanced alchemy table.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Free Knot!  <|obj|> It's called the Gordok Shackle Key - well, that's what these "tons o' fun" keep calling it.  <|text|> You - ranked number one.  Everyone else - ranked number two or lower.  Oh, thank you for freeing me! I knew my life was destined for more than just being an appetizer to some ogre!  <|endoftext|>

There is much to discuss. Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron awaits your arrival in Orgrimmar.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Trouble From the Ground Up <|obj|> Gather 10 Unusual Flower Buds from Budding Flowers in the overgrowth.  <|text|> Teegan's a fool to think the quilboar caused this sudden overgrowth. Look around you. I've been watching these plants bloom and sprout daily - each generation is more mutated than the last. This isn't tribal magic - it's something primal. And dangerous. The day before last a great druid passed through our camp. Seek out Naralex, somewhere in the midst of this jungle. He'll know what to do. And bring him some plant samples from around the overgrowth to help his studies.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Attack on Firewing Point <|obj|> Kill 10 Firewing Defenders, 10 Firewing Bloodwarders, and 10 Firewing Warlocks.  <|text|> We know that the blood elves of Firewing Point are working for Kael'thas and Illidan.  And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the Broken of Tuurem as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon. Whatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers. The Firewing blood elves need to be taken out!  Head up to Firewing Point to the north and see to it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Don't Pick a Fight <|obj|> Retrieve Myra's Favorite Mining Pick.  <|text|> Hey, you're not busy, right? I could use your help. Ya see, I was out mining in Stormsong Valley, when this huge, two-headed monstrosity started chasing after me! I ran away, but I was back in Boralus when I realized I dropped my favorite mining pick! I know this may sound stupid, but if you could get it back for me I'd be grateful. You don't need to do something crazy, like fight them. Instead, sneak by them and grab it. I'll show you a trick to mining monelite seams for your troubles.  <|endoftext|>

You attack the spiritual leaders of the Bristlebacks to the north; weaken them so the Razormanes can defeat them and rule the Barrens.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Lightforge Iron <|obj|> Search the wreckage of The Flying Osprey in the Wetlands.  <|text|> The shipwrecks off the shore here are the doomed Third Fleet of Kul'Tiras, burned and sunk by Red Dragons during the last Great War. The Fleet hailed from Lordaeron, but one ship, an Elvish Destroyer: Flying Osprey, was with it.  It was shipping a load of Lightforge Iron and joined the Third Fleet for protection.  Ironic that it sunk to the same dragons. . . Enough history.  The Flying Osprey is wrecked to the south of Menethil Harbor.  If you find the Lightforge Iron there, bring it to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Journey to Tarren Mill <|obj|> Bring Zamah's Note to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.  <|text|> To rid Stonetalon of the Venture Company, we must take extreme measures.

Where once there was a diversity of life in there, now only the teromoths remain.  And while before they were at peace, now they are agitated and will not hesitate to attack you should you get close. I need to compare the vicious ones to the normal.  Collect for me a number of samples from both.  You'll find the unaffected teromoths both to the south and the north. I'm certain this is related to whatever killed all of the druids.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Necessary Supplies <|obj|> Speak with Buzz Crankchug.  <|text|> The mission to recover the supplies was a success. Well done, <name>.

Make your way to Vulture's Nest in Vol'dun and speak with Buzz Crankchug.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Cyclonian <|obj|> Bring the items on Bath'rah's Parchment to Bath'rah the Windwatcher in Alterac.  <|text|> I have spent ages watching this site.  I watch, so that one day I might see the great Cyclonian fall.  But I have not yet found a champion to defeat the wind lord. Perhaps you are that champion. Prove it to me.  Gather the items I need to summon Cyclonian, and I will know you are a great warrior.  Perhaps then you can defeat him and gain his whirlwind heart. If so, then I will infuse the heart's power in a weapon, and I will give that weapon to you. Here is a parchment with the items I need.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Exhumed <|obj|> Cleanse Sef Iwen's remains.  <|text|> As I've said, I'm unable to interact with the material world.

I am able to dominate a creature to control its body, but I find it deplorable. In essence, it is enslaving the poor creature.

What I want is a body of my own. If you build and animate a golem, it would be devoid of intelligence. A shell. One that I could inhabit without issue.

Doing so will require that my soul is not anchored to anything else in this world, so I need you to remove the spell binding my spirit to my physical remains.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Enough Is Enough <|obj|> Bring the evidence of Lilac Ramble's damage to Theramus.  <|text|> Grumpy or not, Theramus has a job to do. While he hides inside, he can't see the consequences of his absence.

You and your forces have proven valuable allies of the Frostwolves. We'd welcome your aid in securing our Wor'gol.

I'll see you on the battlefield if you choose to come.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Champion: Kor'vas Bloodthorn <|obj|> It's about time, you big lummox.  <|text|> It's about time, you big lummox. For a while there, when you chose Asha Ravensong first, I started to doubt your sanity. Not that there's anything wrong with Asha. But, we both know who the better fighter is. Right? Anyway, of course, I'd be honored to be your champion. I accept!  <|endoftext|>

You must redeem yourself in the eyes of the Council if you wish to remain a friend of Teldrassil. Teach Foulhoof a lesson and you shall be redeemed. Fel Cones are corrupted seeds that fall from the trees. They billow with green smoke. Give some to Foulhoof. He'll think you have brought him a harmless snack.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Blessed Arm <|obj|> Take the Crate of Lightforge Ingots to Grimand Elmore in Stormwind.  <|text|> There is a dwarven weaponsmith in the Dwarven District of Stormwind who can craft with lightforge iron.  His name is Grimand Elmore. I've packed the iron you found into a crate.  Take it to Grimand and tell him your tale.  I'm sure he'll oblige someone on a quest such as yours, and craft for you a weapon - a weapon to give even Morbent Fel worry!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Kodo Roundup <|obj|> Bring five Tamed Kodos and the Kodo Kombobulator back to Smeed Scrabblescrew at Scrabblescrew's Camp.  <|text|> Bibbly thinks he is the only goblin in Desolace who knows how to make money.  Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me.  Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged and dying kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership. Take the kombobulator and use it on any ancient, aged, or dying kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Umber, Archivist <|obj|> Take the Encrusted Silithid Object to Umber - the Cenarion Circle's archivist - in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade.  <|text|> There's plenty to do here still, but I think taking this back to the Circle for analysis is key.  Trust me - the work will still be here once this is all said and done.  If it's a journal inside this sticky chitin, then the Circle would finally have a window into the past! Take this to the Circle's archivist in Nighthaven.  His name is Umber, and the man's brilliant.  Touched, sure, but brilliant nonetheless! Umber 's salvaged tomes in far worse shape than this.  If it can be saved, he can do it.  <|endoftext|>

Deal with him and bring back proof. Then we'll talk.  <|endoftext|>

Even after the horrors of Teldrassil, my brother still tries to do everything he can to help others. Much like you, <name>.

Eventually, I was able to discreetly make my way to where the wagons would be unloaded. The rebels are stockpiling bombs, but it's even worse!

They're piling the bombs against a pillar directly underneath the aqueduct from Tyrhold.

Meet me down there, and we'll find a way to stop this!  <|endoftext|>

No matter what you might have heard about the battle raging in Alterac Valley, one thing remains true: the Stormpike Expedition invaded Frostwolf Territory.

<|startoftext|> Not Fireflies, Flameflies <|obj|> Gather 7 Flameflies.  <|text|> Most of my fellow residents here at Flame Crest seem to have left at some point.

That means it's time for fun! There's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on Garm! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind him--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet. . . which means the power cell didn't get there. I need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Deep Within <|obj|> Speak with the prisoner and learn of his situation.  <|text|> Who. . . who are you? Have you come to extract more of my memories? I'm afraid there aren't any useful ones left, save for the memories of my imprisonment. Or perhaps you're here for something else?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Pristine Moosebone Fish-Hook <|obj|> Put the artifact on display.  <|text|> This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition, suitable for display in Dalaran's archaeology shop.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sealing Fate: Gold <|obj|> These seals provide an additional chance at treasure in dungeons and raids, but at what cost? Gold is indeed treasure, but additional treasure for gold? &nbsp; That is the offer I present.  <|text|> A simple exchange with complex results.  That's the art of doing business.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Redemption for the Redeemer <|obj|> Deliver Remornia to General Draven on the edge of Sinfall.  <|text|> <Energies of death and innervation struggle to free themselves from the blade and consume you to your very core. >

<The bonds of warding placed on this blade by Prince Renathal will not hold for long. It should be taken to Sinfall where more permanent arrangements have been made for this prisoner. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cardinal Ruby <|obj|> Linzy Blackbolt in Dalaran wants you to successfully transmute 5 epic gems with your alchemy skill.  <|text|> The Cardinal Ruby is said to be the finest gem in all of Northrend.  It sparkles like a crystal rose under the sun. Before I teach you this recipe, I ask that you perform five epic gem transmutes to prepare your mind.  You can do any you like, and even do the same transmute many times. Return to me when you are truly ready.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Swimming Lessons <|obj|> Collect the three scrolls.  <|text|> For millennia we have roamed Azeroth's depths, yet never has a land walker journeyed with us. In order to help us, you must learn to travel the waters as we do.

The three scrolls of the sea shall grant you the energies to travel and survive underwater as we do.

Bring me the Scrolls of Harmonious Fins, Endless Tides and Graceful Breaths.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Report to Zurai <|obj|> Report to Zurai at Swamprat Post in Zangarmarsh.  <|text|> With the arrival of Field Commander Romus and his forces, the Alliance and their draenei friends have grown bold. They're militarizing every old draenei ruin from here to Shattrath. In response, the trolls have established a new outpost in the eastern part of Zangarmarsh, just south of the Dead Mire. Swamprat Post, they're calling it. I'm glad they have a sense of humor about living in a place like that, because I wouldn't relish it. The post's commander has asked me to send anyone I can spare.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sent for Help <|obj|> Report to Spiketooth at Deadeye Shore in Durotar.  <|text|> You, <race>, stop a minute. My boss Spiketooth sent me to look for help and supplies.  You don't appear to be a merchant, but you can probably still help him out.  He's just to the southeast of here, next to the crashed cart.  Oh, and tell him I sent you. . . I want to make sure that he knows I'm not just slacking off over here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Re-Reclaim <|obj|> Recover 10 Mogu Artifacts.  <|text|> Mogu do NOT use arcane magics. They are thugs. They have always been thugs. Only when they ruled their empires in the old stories did they ever know any kind of magic. But these mogu are using arcane portals and old artifacts. We need to stop them! $p, look for any artifacts the mogu are using to cast their magics with. I saw piles of these items being collected near the Ruins of Korja south of here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Not Entirely Unprepared <|obj|> Deliver 8 Bundles of Crossbow Bolts to Alliance Lookouts positioned on ledges under the southern terrace.  <|text|> I overheard your conversation with the Admiral. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us. I've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Can you bring them more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Putting the Pieces Together <|obj|> Aid 6 Dormant Stonebound Elementals in reforming.  <|text|> <race>. If you act in the service of the Stone Lords, there are those that might aid you. Watch for the Stonebound. They lie dormant all around the Shuddering Spires. It should not take much prompting to rebind them to service against the flayers.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> And Then There Were Two. . .  <|obj|> Search the Utgarde Catacombs for Glorenfeld.  <|text|> There's no sign of the cipher on Zedd. After carefully searching the area you discover some writing in the dirt: "Glor and Dae inside catacombs. Have cipher and tablets. "Perhaps you should head into the catacombs located just north of here and search for Glorenfeld and Daegarn. The bridge crossing the worg pit will lead you right to the tunnel leading down into the catacombs.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dancing for Marzipan <|obj|> Do a dance emote at Innkeeper Pala, and in exchange you'll receive Thunder Bluff Marzipan! A Hallow's End quest.  <|text|> Even though you're trick-or-treating on behalf of a child, you still need to perform a trick for the treat!  We can't very well change the tradition, now can we. . . I believe the cost of a piece of marzipan nowadays is to bust out and DANCE!  That's right, let me see your moves!  Dance for me, and I'll give you some tasty marzipan!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> We Have the Power <|obj|> Bring Durar's Power Cell and Kathorn's Power Cell to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah.  <|text|> Well, we've got the shell of a golem, but that's not good enough for Tormak. He doesn't realize that these things don't just come together and miraculously start working! We're going to need power cells to animate it. When I was in Dun Argol, I noticed that Rune-Smith Durar and Rune-Smith Kathorn were the ones who manufactured the cells. We'll need one from each to power our golem. You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Secrets in Shadows <|obj|> Use the Collaborator's Robes in Mord'rethar to discover what secrets lie within.  <|text|> Though we have been monitoring the cultist presence at Mord'rethar, we have not yet discovered what mysteries lie within its chambers.

Take these robes. Make your way into the inner sanctum and see what you can discover.

This may be our only chance to learn their intentions, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Making Stumps <|obj|> Krokk wants you to use the Splintertree Axe to cut down the Ashenvale Oaks in Warsong Lumber Camp.  <|text|> As you've been told by now, we are to escort a diplomat from within the besieged lumber camp to safety. As it stands, that's simply impossible. The elves have a thousand arrows trained on the camp's exits. First we must create a diversion - something that will take their eyes off of the camp for a time. My idea is simple. Take this axe and cut down the trees they've been nurturing in the region. When you're through, light the brazier here to speak with me again.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Join the Battle!  <|obj|> Report to Sergeant Willem behind Northshire Abbey in Elwynn Forest.  <|text|> I received an urgent message from Sergeant Willem. Turns out that the Blackrock orcs have hired goblin assassins. They ambushed our battalion behind the abbey. Willem has asked me to send him a hero. You have to go help them, <name>! Find Sergeant Willem north of the abbey at the command tent. Go!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Deliver the Goods <|obj|> Deliver the Barrel of Oil to Pozzik on Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge in Thousand Needles.  <|text|> Alright, <name>, I need you to get this oil back to Pozzik on the Speedbarge, and let him know the good news!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Farmers' Militia <|obj|> Use the Ebon Gargoyle Collar on 6 Provincial Militiamen within Andorhal.  <|text|> The battle started when they attacked us from the rear.  I let my guard down, and a group of poorly-armed farmers and militiamen swung into our flank from the Writhing Haunt. They may be weak, but unchecked, they threaten to overwhelm us with their numbers. Lindsay's pet abominations can handle the melee combat.  You take this collar, stay in the rear, and use it to release my ebon gargoyle upon these farmers.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> What Is Love?  <|obj|> Retrieve the Wooden Figurine and bring it to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.  <|text|> You will need a powerful reagent to tempt an incubus -- an object that represents great devotion and love.

With my scrying, I have located a small figurine that should be suitable for your ritual.

Thousands of years ago, the figurine belonged to a young couple. The original owners are no more, but their keepsake has survived to the present day.

Follow the road north into Ashenvale, then west and past Maestra's Post. You will see a house nestled amongst the trees. There you will find what you seek.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Laying to Rest <|obj|> Find 600 Bone Fragments of Eche'ro and return them to Lessah in Highmountain.  <|text|> If I was able to find a bone fragment in what appeared to be a random location, then that means Eche'ro's bones must be scattered around Highmountain. We must find his remains and give him the proper burial he deserved. Oh, I'm sorry, in case you weren't aware, Eche'ro was Huln Highmountain's mount and companion. He deserves to be honored as Huln once was.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rethu's Pick <|obj|> Bring the Battered Mining Pick to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain.  <|text|> This seam has been mined before - it bears the telltale diagonal ruts of a miner's pick. Looking down, that pick now lays on the ground - handle broken, pick-point dulled with use and years. Carved into the haft is a familiar name: "Rethu" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Eye of Azshara: Put a Cork in It <|obj|> Go to the Eye of Azshara and retrieve the Advanced Corks for Deucus Valdera in Dalaran.  <|text|> A thought occurred to me recently, <name>. The naga have been known to hoard all manner of potions, so they might have the sort of corks we need. In my educated opinion, I believe the best place to start searching is around the Eye of Azshara! Try not to waste your time in there dealing with the naga's goings on, just look for some replacement corks.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cleaning House <|obj|> Kill any combination of 8 Hovel Brutes or Hovel Shadowcasters within Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal.  <|text|> We are well on our way to returning the shrine to its former glory, <name>. But there is some housecleaning to take care of. On the other side of this meadow, some ogre squatters are setting up camp, led by a thick-headed chunk of ugly by the name of Gar'gol. Kill Gar'gol's minions and see if we can't send him packing.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> An End to the Killing <|obj|> Meet Shandris Feathermoon on the deck of Gral's Call.  <|text|> Let's return to the upper decks and see what our current status is. Shandris should be there by now.

I know Shandris and Falstad well enough that they will be there with the captain of this ship, dead or alive.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Master of Elixirs <|obj|> Go to the Black Morass in the Caverns of Time and obtain 10 Essences of Infinity from Rift Lords and Rift Keepers.  <|text|> I've devoted my life to perfecting my elixirs.  Despite my success, I haven't been able to create an elixir of eternal life. I think I know the reagent I'm missing.  I've heard of a place called the Caverns of Time in Azeroth where intruders known as rift lords and rift keepers phase in and out of the timeline. This intrusive time-shifting creates tears in time itself, twisting it infinitely into crystallized essences.  Bring these to me along with samples of your work and I'll teach you all I know.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Blood of My Blood <|obj|> Defeat Anarys Lunastre and deliver &lt; him/her&gt; to Ly'leth Lunastre.  <|text|> As my darling <brother/sister> has demonstrated, Elisande's decision to bring down the shield has sown unrest among the nightborne. Loyalists and demons march together in the streets. Fear and distrust grip our hearts. Family turns against family. I will help Thalyssra stir a new rebellion, but first we must deal with Anarys. I do not wish to spill the blood of my blood - only to help <him/her> see reason. Anarys is likely brooding over our father's memorial. Bring <him/her> to me alive.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Howling Mad <|obj|> Acquire 6 Polluted Incense.  <|text|> The shrine has been taken, <name>. We need the tenacity of Lo'Gosh now more than ever. These defilers - the lice-ridden wolf-men running rampant over the shrine - dishonor the memory of the wolf god. They arrived with the Twilight's Hammer, howling with their own twisted religion. They seek to corrupt noble Lo'Gosh to fit their own warped pantheon. Kill them! Kill them and bring me the tools of their worship, a kind of polluted incense. I must understand what they want with the shrine. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Stroll Through a Cemetery <|obj|> Meet Nathanos Blightcaller outside Barrowknoll Cemetery.  <|text|> Our next stop is in Drustvar.

There, along with some help, we shall identify and extract the body of a Kul Tiran war hero.

With his aid, we will learn much of the Kul Tiran fleet. Enough to break it with ease.

We shall meet you outside Barrowknoll Cemetery.

Do try not to waste time, would you?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Spring Drifter <|obj|> Survive a trip on the Spring Drifter.  <|text|> Nobody really travels up the Ancient Passage on foot. That is just asking for a faceful of saurok if you are not careful. Tell you what, Egg Shell and I were just about to set off upriver to Binan Village. Want a lift?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Badlands Reagent Run <|obj|> Bring 5 Buzzard Gizzards, 10 Crag Coyote Fangs, and  5 Rock Elemental Shards to Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath, Badlands.  <|text|> <name>, I could use your aid if you're up for it.  I am an alchemist of some note, and I seek your aid in acquiring some reagents found out in the Badlands. I need the following items to replenish my stocks: five buzzard gizzards, ten crag coyote fangs, and five rock elemental shards.  Obviously, you can get them off of the beasties themselves; if you're not the fighting type, then find friends who are. Acquire these items for me, you'll get some coin out of the deal.  Watcha wanna do?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Extended Shore Leave <|obj|> Steal the Workshop Orders and slay the new captain of the Zandalari warship.  <|text|> The Zandalari have already begun repairing that warship, but we can keep it crippled with minimal effort. Simply relieve the new captain of his post, and steal the ship's damage report from that workshop just outside the vault. No captain. No repairs. No warship.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Into the Azure <|obj|> Meet Masud the Wise in the Forkriver Crossing.  <|text|> We have done our part. Though I must remain here to watch over the Oathstone and guide the green dragonflight, know that you leave here with our gratitude and faith.

I have received word the Kirin Tor are seeking help in claiming the Azure Oathstone. Helping them with their Oathstone will bring us one step closer to healing Azeroth.

Find Pakina and Masud the Wise of the Kirin Tor. They will instruct you further. Safe journey and pleasant dreams, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> To Dalaran, With Love <|obj|> Crate up Jabrul and mail him to the Cartier & Co Fine Jewelry shop.  <|text|> Jabrul was thinking that he'd like to come up to Dalaran and discuss jewel designs with the masters. But Jabrul doesn't know how to get up to it. Jabrul did have an interesting idea that might work. If you mailed Jabrul to Dalaran, then surely he'd arrive safe and sound.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Kalec's Plan <|obj|> Meet Kalecgos on the ridge near the Arcway Vaults.  <|text|> Your champion was unable to penetrate very far inside the Arcway Vaults due to the heavy legion presence around it.  Hopefully you will have better luck following Archmage Vargoth inside. Kalecgos will be waiting for you on the ridge overlooking Felsoul Hold.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tales of the Broken Isles <|obj|> Eyy buddy, what's that? A book? A level 1 Quest.  <|text|> Hey, wow! It IS a book! I'm always looking for my next good light novel. What's this one about? A <class> who fights some stuff? Neat! Here, have some coins.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Do Your Worst <|obj|> Use the Refurbished Demolisher to destroy 150 Decomposed Ghouls, 20 Frostskull Mages and 2 Bone Giants in the Valley of Lost Hope.  <|text|> You're going to use this machine against the Scourge?  You're not going to win against them like that. You can destroy hundreds. . . even thousands of them.  But you won't win.  Not out here. When you're done playing with your machine, meet me to the north.  There is an old army encampment.  What I will show you will teach you a little bit about who you're up against.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> WANTED: Dark Chronicler <|obj|> Slay Dark Chronicler.  <|text|> Champion wanted for an expedition into the depths of Xibala. Strange noises and wails come from the bones at night and our workers are terrified. Seek out the source of the strange noises and destroy it, and a reward will be yours.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Gnarlpine Corruption <|obj|> Return to Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar.  <|text|> The Gnarlpine tribe's corruption has returned! They ambushed me as I left for the Ban'ethil Barrow Den and proceeded to pillage Starbreeze Village. Something in the forest has corrupted Ursal the Mauler, their chieftain, and he is using the evil powers of the fel moss to drive them mad. I am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news.  The task is left to you, young <class>.  We can only hope that the deranged Gnarlpines have not made it to Ban'ethil yet!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> WANTED: The Demon Hunter <|obj|> Slay Feronas Sindweller.  <|text|> Since reclaiming Jadefire Run from the satyr, the Emerald Circle has sent many druids to begin the long task of cleansing the ruins. Last night, several of them were murdered. . . by a night elf. The witnesses say it was a demon hunter, a crazed disciple of Illidan. A rare sight. No doubt he's gone mad with power just like his master. I'll pay top bounty for proof of this murderer's death. He's been spotted just off the road to the north, in a valley beneath Jadefire Run.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Honor the Flame <|obj|> Honor the Crystalsong Forest flame.  <|text|> Honor the Crystalsong Forest flame.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> How to Glide with Your Dragon <|obj|> Glide through the rings and land in the target area.  <|text|> Let us start with the basics.

If you fly straight you will wear yourself out right now. Use gravity as an aid and aim slightly down to fly a long distance. The rings will give you the general angle that you should use for basic gliding.

First, call upon your drake.

Then, fly through the rings and land at the target location.

If you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and Celormu will reset you.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Sentinel's Game <|obj|> Complete the Sentinel's Game by connecting the two red statues.  <|text|> As you place the statue in its place, several other stone statues appear in the room.  One more ruby-colored statue also appears, in a small enclosure on the far end of the room.  You hear a voice: "The Sentinel watches. The Sentinel protects. The Sentinel's vision never falters. "That red statue on the other side of the room looks important.  Perhaps you should try to connect the two red statues?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fire At Will <|obj|> Enter a Lightforged Battery and slay 30 Frenzied Plaguewings.  <|text|> Look out there, the wings of the bats fill the sky. We must offer what ranged support we can, but our hands are full here. It looks like the Legion has not yet destroyed all of the artillery batteries. If you can get to one, you should be able to show those flying fiends the Light.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The People's Militia <|obj|> Gryan Stoutmantle wants you to kill 15 Defias Pillagers and 15 Defias Looters and return to him on Sentinel Hill.  <|text|> A band of vicious Defias Pillagers has been seen plundering the Gold Coast Quarry, Moonbrook and the Alexston Farmstead.  The People's Militia will not stand for such behavior.  Dispatch immediately, <name>, and make the Light's presence known in Westfall. The Gold Coast Quarry is near the shore, to the West of the tower.  As the next step of your training, I want you to kill 15 of those foul Defias Pillagers and 15 Defias Looters.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Call to Arms <|obj|> Kill 15 Boulderfist Shaman and 10 Boulderfist Lords and return to Drum Fel in the Hammerfall outpost.  <|text|> The head of the beast is ready to be taken off. . . with great force, <name>. You have shown every sign that you are able to help us with this final mighty blow. The leaders of these attacks have made their lair within the ruins of Stromgarde, a glaring symbol of human frailty. Find and slay those Boulderfist lords and their lackey shaman who would try and drive us from these lands.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> At The Enemy's Gates <|obj|> Ranii at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to kill 15 Boneguard Footmen, 10 Boneguard Scouts, and 3 Boneguard Lieutenants.  <|text|> Even as we ready for the tournament, Argent Crusade forces prepare the way for an assault on the enemy's stronghold of Icecrown Citadel. In the Court of Bones in southwestern Icecrown, a few brave crusaders have set up a forward camp on the southern side of Corp'rethar. Equip your lance and mount the stabled campaign charger at the camp, then destroy the Lich King's minions. Do not fear the masses of boneguard footmen, <name>, for they can easily be trampled under your horse's hooves.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Missive: Assault on the Gorian Proving Grounds <|obj|> Assault the ogre forces at the Gorian Proving Grounds in Nagrand.  <|text|> The ogres at the Gorian Proving Grounds be rousin' champions to turn against our forces in Nagrand.

A decisive assault on their training grounds should prevent dem from musterin' the forces dey be needin' to stand against us, and will help remind them that we are not an enemy they want to be makin'.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Black Rook Hold: An Unclaimed Soul <|obj|> Collect an Unclaimed Soul from The Amalgam of Souls in the Black Rook Hold dungeon.  <|text|> In order to create the anchor, we'll need to link something of Shinfel's to an unclaimed soul.

The soul will act like a beacon, guiding Shinfel through the Twisting Nether, and back to Dreadscar Rift.

Shinfel's staff should provide us with the link we need, but the soul will be a bit harder to find. 

Dwelling within Black Rook hold is an amalgam of souls, some lost and forgotten. Killing this monstrosity should provide us with the soul we need.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Burden of Proof <|obj|> Administer the tests to prove Lucy Waycrest's innocence in Hangman's Point.  <|text|> I think we have everything we need to conduct three of the villagers' tests. Let us hope this is enough to convince them.

I'm sure Constable Framer is champing at the bit to proceed with his trial, and I would prefer it if you were the one to administer the tests. I may not know you well, but I trust you farther than the constable.

Speak with him when you're ready to begin. . . . and do me a favor. Make this quick.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Breaching the Barrier <|obj|> Collect the Black Candle, the Tome of Protection, and the Shadowblade at the Fel Forge and bring them to Oronok.  <|text|> The ritual site is already prepared, and it is protected by a barrier. . . one that I created. I can destroy the barrier, but I will need three items currently in use at Forge Camp Vengeance.

If you can get those ritual items, I will meet you at the Corrupted Refuge and remove the barrier. Even if it kills me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Empyrium Deposit Chunk <|obj|> Find someone on the Vindicaar who might be able to train you on how to mine an empyrium deposit.  <|text|> <As you swing your pickaxe into the ore, it hits with a resounding thud, sending a small chunk of it to the ground. At this rate, it would take you all day to get a sufficient amount of ore from this deposit. ><Perhaps someone can give you some insight into how to mine this deposit properly. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Taste of Flame <|obj|> A Taste of Flame is the final quest of a long chain that is begun by picking up Divine Retribution from Velarok Windblade in Searing Gorge.  <|text|> I wish to taste the searing flames of the mountain of fire. To let the molten fires of Blackrock cascade across my being. That essence, that searing heat, it is what I crave. Bael'Gar resides in the Depths of Blackrock: A being of pure flame, born of the fires of Ragnaros. Slay Bael'Gar and from his smoldering remains bring for me a piece of his inner fire. Use the molt on his remains to safely extract the inner flame. Succeed and be rewarded.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Heart of Azeroth <|obj|> Travel to the Chamber of Heart and commune with Azeroth.  <|text|> Our world's dyin', <name>. Sargeras's sword has cut deep. Her pain is drivin' the elements into a frenzy!

I can hear Azeroth's voice, but she needs more than her speaker.

She needs her champion.

Far below us lies an ancient titan vault called the Chamber of Heart. I sense she wishes tae speak tae ye there.

Come with me into the chamber. It may be our only chance tae save her!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jumping <|obj|> Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Rocket Jump ability at Walt's Iron Rune Carving.  <|text|> Alright, <name>; the time has come for you to climb inside this thing and learn how to use its basic abilities. When you're ready, get on the work bench and I'll get you situated inside the construct. Your first lesson is going to be using the construct's transportation system. You'll notice that the iron dwarves have set up special rune carvings around the dig site. Their constructs use those rune carvings to power up and fly from point to point. Try it with the rune carving I built here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ram Hide Harnesses <|obj|> While some of our soldiers are busy capturing wolves for the stable master, others must provide for the simple necessities that riding requires.  <|text|> Well done, soldier. I will notify you when I have stockpiled enough of the hides. Carry on!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Spirit of Rhunok <|obj|> Speak with the Spirit of Rhunok at the Altar of Rhunok.  <|text|> My feelings tell me that Rhunok doesn't have much time. I can tell that the arctic bear god's spirit has already separated from his weakened body. It is his spirit with which you must commune. His altar lies to the northwest beyond Drak'Mabwa.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bookie Herod <|obj|> Find Bookie Herod's Records.  <|text|> If Kurzen knows Thorsen's secret, then we have a spy in our midst.  We must determine how the secret was leaked! Thorsen's contact within Kurzen's camp was Bookie Herod.  Herod is Kurzen's logistics officer and knows everything about the running of Kurzen's Compound.  If you can get Herod's notes or records, maybe we can find out how Thorsen was discovered. When we were still with Kurzen, Bookie's office was on the top floor of the camp's only two-story house.  His records are probably still there.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Last Living Lorekeeper <|obj|> Seek out Nordu, an Ancient of Lore, at the Flamewake in Mount Hyjal.  <|text|> You have awakened the ancients, <name>, but the wilderness spirit Aessina remains silent. With her help, we can turn the tide of this attack and undo the damage Twilight's Hammer has done. There may be one who can help us. The oldest of the trees, Nordu, stood in the center of what is now the Flamewake for thousands of years. His wisdom is as old as this mountain. If that old tree still lives, perhaps he can awaken Aessina. . . seek him out.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Worthy Ally: Dream Wardens <|obj|> Aid the Dream Wardens and their allies throughout the Emerald Dream.  <|text|> So much change to that which should be unchanging. . . 

Rarely has the Dream seen such turmoil. It is meant to be a place of peace. Of life.

<|startoftext|> The Grimtotem are Coming <|obj|> Slay 7 Grimtotem Marauders.  <|text|> This is going to take a while, but I'm sure we'll beat them back.

She'll get you a boat to go there. Mind helping us out a little on your way to her?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Saving the Guard <|obj|> Complete the "Moon Guard Stronghold" storyline in Suramar, then meet Archmage Kalec in Shal'Aran.  <|text|> The Moon Guard were once among the most powerful sorcerers on Azeroth. Most assumed their ranks demolished after the War of the Ancients, but it seems they have managed to survive in their ancient stronghold in Suramar!

<|startoftext|> Creatures of the Eco-Domes <|obj|> Tag 12 Talbuks for Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire.  <|text|> Your work with the lashers turned up some astounding information, but I wonder if it holds true for animals as well. Gathering information on the talbuks that live underneath this dome is going to be trickier than studying the lashers, I'm afraid. Using this tagging device, you can put a weakened talbuk to sleep and apply a tag that I'll use to track the animal as it matures. The tagging mechanism won't work unless the talbuk has expended most of its energy.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hall of Samples <|obj|> Explore the Hall of Samples.  <|text|> Did you hear what that console said?

There's a hall full of samples. Ancient titan machinery? Specimens from other worlds? Only Tyr knows what's in there!

Slay them all, and may this unholy union cease.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> WANTED: Orcs!  <|obj|> You have been tasked with slaying opposing Orc players in Alterac Valley.  <|text|> By order of Corporal Noreg Stormpike, all able bodied soldiers of Stormpike are required to slay any opposing orcs that they meet upon the field of battle.

Take this with you, it may give him enough protection should you run into any trouble. And be careful not to get captured by the giants yourself.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Enter the Illidari: Coilskar <|obj|> Feed a soul into the Legion Gateway Activator and then use it to summon in your Coilskar forces.  <|text|> The next gateway's down on the Molten Shore. Our Coilskar forces are waiting at the Black Temple on the other side.

Personally, I wouldn't have chosen to bring our naga allies. But, their leader did swear fealty to Lord Illidan. I suppose we'll see.

We'll have to find a way to power the gateway's activator. Like this last gateway, it runs on souls.

<Allari the Souleater grins as Sevis says this. > <|endoftext|>

Little is known of it, for only the titan's most devoted acolytes are given sigils that permit entrance.

If we lay claim to these sigils, they could be infused into the Vindicaar. This would allow our forces to stage a direct assault upon the fetid heart of Argus.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Pay It Forward <|obj|> Use the Enchanted Conch Shell to rescue 6 Drowning Soldiers.  <|text|> You are now able to move about this realm more freely and without fear of drowning.

<|startoftext|> Symbols of Power <|obj|> Collect 8 Legion Emblems.  <|text|> This demon has information that could lead us to those in charge. Unfortunately, he is more fearful of his master than he is of us. We need to change his mind about that.

<|startoftext|> The Mark of Quality <|obj|> Bring 10 Thick Yeti Hides to Pratt McGrubben in Feathermoon Stronghold.  <|text|> My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises.

The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Feral Scar Vale.  I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.

But while demonic power fills the halls, my magic cannot penetrate to such heights. If only I had powerful Fel Essences to work with, I could attune my magic to their defenses and bypass them.

Tiny wails have been heard in the caverns for some time since Naralex was awakened. At first, we suspected that some deviate critters had survived. Upon further investigation, we found them to be growing and multiplying beyond our wildest expectations. The corpse of Verdan the Everliving may have something to do with it, we're not sure. That's why we're sending you in. I've also seen suspicious footprints leading into the caverns recently. We may not be alone, be careful.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Seeking Father <|obj|> Search for Sentinel Ku-Yao.  <|text|> I've searched everywhere. . . but I haven't found my father. I KNOW he's alive still.

If you ever go over there, can you look for my dad?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Proof of Loyalty <|obj|> Slay 25 withered within Suramar.  <|text|> <Tytallo listens as you recount what happened with Lyndras. >I see. You sound almost. . . sympathetic to the wretch. The nightfallen are liars and thieves. ALL of them. Lyndras included.

<|startoftext|> Rin'thissa <|obj|> Summon and defeat Rin'thissa.  <|text|> My sister Nal'ryssa has her claws in you, doesn't she? That weakling doesn't know the first thing about mining.

<|startoftext|> Fight for Warsong Gulch <|obj|> Bring 3 Warsong Gulch Marks of Honor to an Alliance Brigadier General outside the battlegrounds.  <|text|> The Silverwing Sentinels are at war with the Warsong Outriders due to the destruction the Orcs are causing to the forest.  There are, however, more reasons to defend this particular forest than plain love for nature. The forest forms a strategic barrier that makes Ashenvale defendable against a large-scale attack.  Without it, Astranaar would last a day or two before being annexed to the Barrens. Do your part in fighting the Warsong Outriders, <name>!  For the Alliance!  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> A "Noble" Event <|obj|> Send champions on missions to investigate the hunt.  <|text|> The invitation appears to be for an exclusive fox hunt. They plan to hunt Volpin, a rare, elusive fox somewhere in the Broken Isles.  Perhaps we can take advantage of this?

I managed to clear them off of my property, but they got away with some of my crops. They took them down to the river, to the south. I have no idea what they're doing with them, but it's probably not eating them. If my father wants his delivery now, I'm going to need some help getting those crops back. Could you help me out?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Checking In <|obj|> Check on Sage Liao at the Zaochin Strand in Kun-Lai Summit.  <|text|> When the trolls came, they brought their mercenary. . . friends with them.

It is signed by a Theodore Furlbrow and cosigned by his wife, Verna.  And on the back of the deed are hastily scrawled words: "We leaned on Furlbrow and got his deed.  Thought it might be handy if you wanted to forge one of these for your own place. The Furlbrows won't give us trouble.

<|startoftext|> A Home-Cooked Meal <|obj|> Gather Roast Duck Delight for the Obsidian Whelp.  <|text|> Black dragon whelps need to grow up to be big and strong. Our hatchling here seems quite small, so I believe she will require something hearty and nutritious to help her along her way.

You're the best I can do; I may as well help you. Omarion left me with one recipe. It's the only song I know. . . I can make a few variations of these pants; you just gotta supply the materials.  <|endoftext|>

Unfortunately, many were captured, and we've found that some are being tortured in the mines. You have to go rescue them - nobody deserves what they are going through. . .

And, when you finish, kill whoever captured them. No mercy, $p!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Opening Wounds <|obj|> Speak to Arzal'kal and listen to what he has to say.  <|text|> My hunters were the ones who found Arzal'kal. They said he helped them fight off several Legion ambushes.

During our endless vigil on Argus, we had seen nothing like it. He was not as powerful as some demons, but he was persistent.

He said he wished to speak with Velen and knew that we had been in contact with him. So, I have fulfilled his request.

If Velen is all he claims to be, then he would not turn away even the least worthy of his people.

We will see. I expect little.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tooth and Claw <|obj|> Collect 100 Tanaan Jungle Teeth from the various wildlife within Tanaan Jungle.  <|text|> These wimps lugging wood around the jungle keep talking about how dangerous it is.

He spends a lot of time out there, even for a squire with responsibilities to his knight. Find a way to distract or incapacitate him and search him. If he's up to something, we'll know it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Round 4: The P. U. G.  <|obj|> Defeat Hackiss, Healiss and Tankiss.  <|text|> And now the final round. I have selected three challengers for you to face.

He usually holds himself up in the Undercity. . . right near the Apothecarium. He was a little more loose-lipped when it came to speaking about what he wanted the Tablet for. Apparently some of the mages of Undercity are looking to study some of the arcane spells the highborne used. They think this tablet will help them. Markri was adept at summoning creatures; especially elementals. Take the Tablet of Markri and return to me for your part of the reward.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.  <|obj|> Bring Leftwitch's Package back to Roetten Stonehammer in Ironforge.  <|text|> To get paid, you're gonna have to get back to Ironforge and speak to Roetten himself. He'll love getting Leftwitch's package out of the way anyway. Just give him this and it should be enough to get your booty. And don't worry, I'm still going to put in a good word for you when I get back. I shouldn't be in Desolace much longer.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Fate of Dalaran <|obj|> Speak with Jaina Proudmoore and hear her story.  <|text|> Jaina is refusing to hear me out. Father was hoping I would have some pull with her, but I think she still sees me as a child. You, on the other hand, are a hero of the Alliance and I know she respects your deeds. Is there something you can say to her to convince her we need her help?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fungal Spores <|obj|> Bring 4 Fungal Spores to Apothecary Helbrim at the Crossroads.  <|text|> The oases of the Barrens hide a mystery.

Defeat the creature and retrieve its essence immediately!  You will need to take it to Alturus. Should you fail, the stars predict you will have let a great terror loose upon the skies. A terror known as Nightbane!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cluster Clutch <|obj|> Collect 333 Shadowy Gems by looting Elementium Gem Clusters from creatures in the Dragon Soul Raid encounter.  <|text|> The daggers I have given you are lifeless shells. They can do great things, once they are given a means to contain the power I have in mind. I need for you to acquire Shadowy Gems for me. The facets of these unusual stones are like windows into the infinite. They are often used by minions of the Twilight's Hammer to control the most powerful of elementals.

<|startoftext|> Old Stomping Grounds <|obj|> Collect 15 Lost Animacones.  <|text|> Once, long ago, I journeyed to Ardenweald to assist in putting down a threat now long forgotten.

I remember that while there, I saw small creatures taking tiny clusters of anima--animacones, the fae called them--and buried them under the soil.

If those clusters are still there, we must gather them for ourselves!

I should be able to unearth any of the animacones we encounter. Let's go hunt for them!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Supplies to Private Thorsen <|obj|> Deliver the Miscellaneous Goblin Supplies to Private Thorsen.  <|text|> Hmm. Yes, I do have something you could do, actually. Lieutenant Doren and his followers up in the north need their regular supplies from us. They haven't been delivered, and with the trolls attacking, I'll need someone to do it. Doren's camp lies northwest of the road at the entrance to Stranglethorn from Duskwood. Give the supplies to Private Thorsen, if he's not in the camp, then he'll be patrolling south of it.

<|startoftext|> Power Over the Tides <|obj|> Use the Orb of Elune on the remains of 6 Enraged Tidal Spirits.  <|text|> Do not worry about me.  My wounds are deep and death will soon come to me.

Then I found a device which supposedly is used to summon 'im! Only, it's missin' some pieces from what I can make out.

It howls for hours about being without its favorite snobold. If the Argent Crusade didn't wish to use this monster in the coliseum, I'd slay it myself. Perhaps it's time to bring the beast its playthings. Take this net and travel to Garm's Bane in southeast Storm Peaks. It's just northeast of K3. Capture some of those snobolds and pray to the Light you've found the right one.  <|endoftext|>

The true power in these lands continues to grow in strength and number while we squabble over scorched earth with orcs.

Unfortunately, instead of returning it, the idiot decided to try it on. . . I suppose ogres can't resist anything bright and shiny. His bumbling actions have become something of a problem, however. The Crown of Will enabled him to resist the possession placed upon him to serve Lady Sylvanas. The Dark Lady wants an example made, travel to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad and report to Melisara, my lieutenant.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Seal of Ascension <|obj|> Find the three gemstones of command: The Gemstone of Smolderthorn, Gemstone of Spirestone, and Gemstone of Bloodaxe.  <|text|> As you can see, the unadorned seal has three empty sockets. Each of those sockets must be filled with a gemstone representing the leadership's command. Finally, Overlord Wyrmthalak, master of the lower citadel, must forge the seal in the flames of the Black Dragonflight. Understand this, mortal: the chance that one of the three generals of the lower citadel would carry a gemstone at any given time is rare. You must be vigilant in your quest. Remain determined!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tear Down This Wall!  <|obj|> Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore, then break into the lower city and secure it for the Alliance.  <|text|> The time has come.

I'd swear that those proto-dragons edge closer to camp every time I turn my back. . .

If you can, recover those tools from them, so that we may continue our efforts to arm our allies.  <|endoftext|>

Your spirit will be connected to the element the sapta was created for, and only a select few shaman know the recipe. The sapta is always drunk in a holy place, and never anywhere else--remember that. Seek out Spirit Rock southwest of here--it is found at the end of the Hidden Path.

<|startoftext|> The Thandol Span <|obj|> Destroy the cache of explosives.  <|text|> Heavens no!  Poor Rustlocke.  'Tis quite a tragedy indeed. We must not let his death pass in vain.  This parchment you discovered indicates that Kam Deepfury, the mastermind behind the original attack, arranged for a cache of explosives to be stashed just across the Thandol Span, in Arathi Highlands.

<|startoftext|> The Pulsing Madness <|obj|> Dispel 5 Void Manifestations.  <|text|> This broken still retains some of his sanity, though not all of it. I can sense some Void influence nearby, but it is isolated to small pockets. Dispelling these manifestations should help our friend here clear his mind. Perhaps we can use the prayer fragments you found, as they still contain some Light energy. I will try and make sense of his chattering in the meantime. Maybe we can learn something about what is happening here.  <|endoftext|>

I need an invisibility potion and a healing potion; both might come in handy real soon if he pulls this off. In return, I'll give you this recipe for a potion I've been developing while learning from Lotwil. It's based on some of the research he's been doing here in the Badlands.  <|endoftext|>

They took the left piece of Lord Valthalak's amulet with them. Good riddance, I say, but we need that piece back. From what we could gather, they were actually slain by Grand Crusader Dathrohan himself for failing the initiation rites inside his chamber in the Scarlet Bastion. In any case, we. . . meaning you, are still going to need to retrieve that piece of the amulet.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Puddle Stomping <|obj|> Kill 8 Tidal Striders.  <|text|> Here's the situation. If we want to establish the Bilgewater Cartel's market presence in Gadgetzan, we'll need to start providing services to the community. The new coast has been great for business here, but the sea also brought sea giants with it. They're large, foul, and drive real estate values down.

<|startoftext|> Supply Recovery <|obj|> Recover 6 Iron Horde Shipments.  <|text|> We seem to have arrived at just the right time!

Ashvane's onto somethin' big.

They got guys workin' round the clock in there. Even brought in some muscle to keep everyone uh. . . "motivated. "

I don't know anything about what they're makin', but I know it ain't passin' through here to Boralus.

If I were dumb enough to go snooping around in there, I'd look at the goods themselves. See if they got shipping labels.

But I ain't that dumb, so you gotta do it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Grim Equation <|obj|> Destroy the three Soul Coffers on the Shattered Fields.  <|text|> They were waiting for us when we crashed. It was all we could do to establish our small outpost. Even now they drain the souls of our fallen to fuel their attacks. Destroy their soul coffers. Free our comrades and let them join the Light.

The mixture requires common herbs, as well as bogblossom, which usually grows atop the tallest mushrooms in the marsh. Fly up there and pursue them but take care, as they're quite fragile and may explode violently if mishandled.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Blackwood Pledge <|obj|> Return to Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex.  <|text|> It won't be immediate, but the elementals' anger will soon die down and my people will live to fight another day. I will go help you and Malfurion in any way that I can.  <|endoftext|>

Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01. She has scrying gems for eyes so I could see everything she saw. She made it to Fungal Rock--the apes' lair--just east of here, and that's when I lost contact. The last thing I saw was one of their alpha males rushing up to say hello to her! Can you help me find her?  <|endoftext|>

Our rig just can't handle the amount of oil we're pumping out of the ground. It's literally bursting at the seams! To be more accurate, it's bursting at the valves. I've been working double-time to get the valves repaired, but every time I finish the rounds, they're all broken again. It's as if someone is following me. . . That's ridiculous though. . . . Maybe you'll have better luck. Try getting as many of those valves tightened as you can.  <|endoftext|>

It's nasty stuff.  Unfortunately, we need to burn huge amounts of it to get the Verne to move, and it's both bad-smelling AND deadly to the local wildlife.  We need to be more environmentally conscious. The sea creatures nearby have particularly oily flesh.  Take this device up to Seabrush - just above this cave - and use it on the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks.  Their oil might save the lives of hundreds of other sea creatures.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Egg Evac <|obj|> Rescue 4 eggs from the Flashfrost Enclave.  <|text|> The Primalists have stolen our eggs for their perverse rituals! They must be stopped.

<|startoftext|> Tiara of the Oracle <|obj|> Bring Vek'nilash's Circlet, 2 Idols of the Sage, 5 Silver Scarabs and 5 Bone Scarabs to Andorgos in Ahn'Qiraj.  <|text|> The Twin Emperors. . . their incessant whispers are slowly taking a toll on my sanity.  They mock me, knowing I cannot step further into their domain to save my brother Arygos. In my visions I see their monstrous faces adorned by powerful crowns.  But I will have my revenge. . . I will transmute these symbols of Qiraji power to ones better suited to our needs. Bring me the components I require, <name>.  I will give you a headpiece of unmatched power.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Still Within Reach <|obj|> Kill the Spellsworn Wingcatcher at the Old Weyrn Grounds in the Forbidden Reach.  <|text|> While we dracthyr were kept in stasis, the Spellsworn, ancient servants of Malygos the Spellweaver, were our wardens. However, despite being slain years ago, the late Aspect's forces are still loyal to him and his lasting directive to keep this island contained. They present a danger to any dracthyr still lost, wounded, or otherwise unaccounted for.

Scouts have reported the sighting of a rather large Spellsworn brute hunting for escaped dracthyr. This deadly pursuer must be dealt with.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> AHHHHHHHHHHHH! AHHHHHHHHH! ! !  <|obj|> Use the Bravo Company Siege Tank to kill 200 Blackrock soldiers.  <|text|> I'm here to help you and Bravo Company end this mess. You're to get in the Bravo Company siege tank and clear a path to Keeshan's Post on the other side of the valley, north of here. This is a high alert situation soldier as the Blackrock orcs are now aware of your location and sending a large force to meet you head on. Terminate them all with extreme prejudice. I'll see you on the other side. May the Light have mercy on your soul.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Driving Them Out <|obj|> Slay 15 Lor'danel defenders.  <|text|> This is it, <name>. 

Lor'danel is all that stands in our way before we capture Darnassus and reclaim Kalimdor. 

Rout the defenders. We cannot risk allowing a single enemy to escape until we have secured control over the World Tree.

I want this place in order by the time the Warchief arrives.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Corrupted Songflower <|obj|> You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a songflower plant.  <|text|> You apply some Cenarion plant salve to the songflower. It immediately begins to shed its corrupted form, blossoming into a vibrant and healthy plant. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(3363)) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Return to the Crossroads.  <|obj|> Buy a wind rider to the Crossroads from the wind rider master Doras, then bring Gryshka's Letter to Zargh at the Crossroads.  <|text|> My wind riders are trained to fly to many different places, as long as you have already been to that place and spoken with the wind rider master there. You have been to the Crossroads and spoken to their wind rider master Devrak, so now you can fly directly to him from here.  Once you're at the Crossroads, you can deliver Gryshka's letter to Zargh. Speak with me when you are ready to go.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Lord Reclaimer <|obj|> Find Lyalia and kill Groundbreaker Brojai.  <|text|> They have my daughter! Brojai. . . that Lord Reclaimer! I can see him clearly through Lyalia's eyes. That foolish girl must have tried to take him head on. Please, $p! Go to the Ruins of Korja and try to free her. I'll get Kang and try to draw out Brojai from the ruins with a distraction.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Blacksmithing Plans <|obj|> Hey, &lt; name&gt; .  <|text|> Hey, <name>. I've got some new recipes for ya, if you're interested.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> . . . And Bury the Rest <|obj|> Arm 6 Frazzlecraz Explosives in the Frazzlecraz Motherlode mine.  <|text|> It's not enough to kill 'em - after Bael'dun, I want to give those goblins a taste of their own. Go into Frazzlecraz's mine and arm a pile of the explosives inside. At the entrance to the mine you should see some sort of switch or plunger. Once the explosives are armed, use the plunger to blow that place sky-high. Put the fear in 'em, <class>!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Glory Amidst Chaos <|obj|> Kill General Thorg'izog, Dragon-Lord Neeralak, and High Warlock Xi'lun.  <|text|> You and Keeshan are going back to that mountain.  There's three orcs who survived the attack, and we won't rest until they're dead. That's right, I'm talking about the Big Three. General Thorg'izog crawled back into the Firegut Furnace, and Dragon-Lord Neeralak is cowering in the cave on the mountain's peak.  Xi'lun is in the back of the Skull Warren, plotting with his fellow warlocks. Leave your mark, <name>.  Hunt down those sniveling Blackrocks, and teach them the might of Redridge!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Eye See You <|obj|> Use Tehd's Eye of Kilrogg to investigate Felblaze Ingress.  <|text|> There is being blind, and then there is being stupid. This eyeless wonder next to me wants to barrel into Felblaze Ingress without preparation. Bah! I say we scout it first. Here, I will provide you with an extra eye I picked up from a place better left unmentioned. Enter Felblaze Ingress, investigate the area, and try not to get poked in the eye.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Errand for Apothecary Zinge <|obj|> Bring the Field Sampling Kit to Apothecary Zinge in the Undercity.  <|text|> The kit is ready, <name>.  No doubt that Apothecary Zinge will want this as soon as possible.  Take it to her without delay, and let her know that I will add the cost of the kit to the Society's tab.  Also, please extend to her my warmest salutations. Well, don't just stand there.  Such is the life of a simple courier, yes?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Hand of Fate <|obj|> Meet your escort to the Exodar at Bladefist Bay.  <|text|> Ever since the Legion invaded the Exodar, the draenei have been hard at work preparing to return to Argus. At long last they have a vessel that can take us there.

With the way to that dreadful world open, we simply could not ask for a better opportunity to strike. Prophet Velen called for you quite specifically to join the assault force.

You should make your way to Bladefist Bay right away. Arrangements have been made for a ship there to take you to Azuremyst.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Lady's Necklace <|obj|> Take The Lady's Necklace to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.  <|text|> The necklace shimmers, a remarkable piece of jewelry that doesn't seem to succumb to the gloom that permeates the Ghostlands. Given the inscription, and where you found it, it must be the lost property of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner herself! Perhaps it would be best to first take it to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien? He seems to be the highest ranking Forsaken in the area and is sure to know what to do with it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Spread the Enchantment <|obj|> Craft 2 Runed Draconium Rods for Soragosa in Valdrakken.  <|text|> Algeth'ar Academy has put in an order for more enchanting rods. We need everyone to pitch in if we are going to fill the order on time. Could you be of assistance?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Taking the Harbor <|obj|> Magister Ilastar at Sun's Reach Armory wants you to slay 6 Dawnblade Summoners, 6 Dawnblade Blood Knights and 3 Dawnblade Marksmen.  <|text|> One of Kael's most elite forces, the Dawnblade army, has been stationed at the Sun's Reach Harbor and Dawnstar Village. The harbor is of critical importance to our plans, so any Dawnblade casualties you inflict will be of tremendous help.  Kael'thas will rue the day that he turned his back on his people and sided with the Burning Legion.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Artisan's Supply: Salamanther Scales <|obj|> Deliver 3 Salamanther Scales to Haephesta at the Ruby Lifeshrine.  <|text|> Are you looking for work, skinner? The Artisan's Consortium asked me to gather the scales of a salamanther for their customers.

I may be an artisan, but I am no one's errand child!

But. . . ah, perhaps you could find some?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Backdoor <|obj|> Escape the Vault.  <|text|> This will take Mayla some time to adjust to. That being said, we should return to Thunder Totem. Just south of here is a tunnel that should take us through the old drogbar slave enclave and then to an opening beyond. We keep a small Skyhorn outpost there to watch and ensure nothing enters or leaves this vault without us knowing about it. They should be able to fly us back.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Artisanal Aging <|obj|> Buy Temporal Parmesan from Gorgonzormu in Valdrakken for the Bronze Hatchling.  <|text|> I have been learning much about bronze dragons since arriving in Valdrakken. While they take their charge of time seriously, they have found many hobbies for their free time that their magic can aid them with.

My friend Gorgonzormu swears by his cheeses for all stages of dragon life. He mentioned that he has a type of parmesan that is excellent for bronze whelps. It seems that our hatchling's first meal is figured out!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> South Sprint 12 <|obj|> Run through the arch, hit the red marker, then the purple, then return to the Ironelf games camp.  <|text|> For this challenge, run through the arch, then get to the red marker, the purple  marker, then return here before the bell tolls 12 times. Good luck!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Spiritforged Aegis <|obj|> Bring the Spiritforged Aegis to Paolone.  <|text|> <As you pick up the shield, your hands seem to lightly bounce off of it with ease.

This should help your soulbinds take a few hits in the Path of Ascension. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Twinbraid Needs to Know <|obj|> Report to General Twinbraid at Twinbraid's Patrol in Southern Barrens.  <|text|> < General Twinbraid will want to know the details of this cowardly attack. You gather up the evidence. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Teleport This!  <|obj|> Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to use the Mental Interference Rod on the Mo'arg at Forge Base: Gehenna and use their Detonate Teleporter ability on the three teleporters in the forge camp.  <|text|> As fun as killing demons might be, it does us little good when the Legion can keep using its teleporters to replace anything we kill. Unfortunately, I don't have any high-powered explosives handy. . . but the mo'arg that maintain the teleporters do. Take this rod. . . I've tuned its powers to interfere with mo'arg brain frequencies.  Return to Forge Base: Gehenna and use it on any mo'arg you see.  You won't have long, but you'll be able to use their demolition charges on the nearby teleporters.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cleaning Out the Vault <|obj|> Purge the Shadow Vault of the Scourge presence.  <|text|> The Scourge's rampant aggression has proven difficult to predict, even for us.

By the time we knew they were upon us, it was too late.

With our forces spread thin, we are left with what you see before you.

Enter the vault. Slay our enemies where they stand.

Soon the Shadow Vault will be ours once more.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Exterminators at Work <|obj|> Speak with Rinno Curtainfire inside the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den.  <|text|> The infestation of our barrow den occured nearly overnight. Vicious creatures never before seen in these lands swarmed the tunnels, hatching from unseen eggs. With the few of us here, it was all we could do to keep them from spreading outside the den. We were forced to hire goblins from Everlook that claimed expertise in extermination, but they have not yet been successful. If you wish to assist them, enter the barrow den to the west of this lodge and speak with Rinno Curtainfire.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Warlord's Council <|obj|> Find out who is behind the written note.  <|text|> Upon closer inspection, you notice a piece of leather parchment looped around her neck. Scrawled upon it angrily are the words: "WITNESS THE FATE OF THOSE WHO DEFY THE IRON HORDE! " <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Zul'Gurub Voodoo <|obj|> This potent pile of voodoo witchery emanates strong mojo.  <|text|> As you slip the tablet into the voodoo pile, a primal screech shatters the silence.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Frigid Boon <|obj|> Harvest 10 winter's kiss without taking cold damage.  <|text|> While harvesting this winter's bite, you managed to pluck the flower without breaking any petals, a feat you had not accomplished before. Taking a quick mental note of every detail about yourself and your surroundings, one point sticks out to you. The heat from your breath appears to have made the petals supple enough to bend instead of break. You also believe that this may be a way to prevent the flower from activating its defensive cold blast. If that is the case, it could be extremely useful.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Bring Down the Warbringer!  <|obj|> Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.  <|text|> We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council here at the Deathforge, but now it's time to finish the job. I found a key among the items in Kagrosh's pack. At least he accomplished something before they got to him. The key should help you to track down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold. After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Blood Guard Gulmok. We must not keep him waiting.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Reports from the Field <|obj|> Speak to Dark Ranger Lyana and Deathstalker Razael in the battlefield at the Bleeding Vale south of Vengeance Landing.  <|text|> Our mission in Northrend is to destroy Arthas.  The Alliance are but an obstacle that we'll crush wherever we find them. We've managed to destroy their easternmost fleet; but the survivors have barricaded themselves on the Derelict Strand, south of here. Our forces should've overwhelmed their make-shift defenses long ago, but we underestimated their will to live.  Seek my officers in the field, Dark Ranger Lyana and Deathstalker Razael and get them to report on the situation.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Earthshatter Handguards <|obj|> Rimblat Earthshatter at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make Earthshatter Handguards if you bring him the following: 1 Desecrated Handguards, 8 Wartorn Chain Scraps, 1 Arcanite Bar and 5 Cured Rugged Hides.  <|text|> Would you honor me by returning the armor of those that fell in the defense of these lands? The armor has been desecrated and is undoubtedly being used for evil; however, with wartorn armor scraps, the desecrated armor can be renewed and worn for battle once more. Bring me the remnants of the fallen along with purification materials and Earthshatter shall be yours to don. Search Naxxramas.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Scars from the Past <|obj|> Ask the Maruuk centaur about the disappearance of Bovan Windtotem.  <|text|> A tribe of tauren came to the Dragon Isles led by a close friend of mine, Bovan Windtotem. No one has heard from them since they entered these plains.

If they have gone missing, then I must find them. Unfortunately, I underestimated the size of this place. 

You have an existing relationship with the centaur. Will you go speak with them and see if they have any information on Bovan or his tribe? 

Perhaps they can help narrow down my search.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Coldheart Flight Routes <|obj|> Bring the Coldheart Flight Routes to Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge.  <|text|> <These diagrams contain detailed information concerning the patrols of the Mawsworn Kyrian. Ve'nari would relish this knowledge. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fargal the Elder <|obj|> It is good to know the people of this land still pay homage to the olden races.  <|text|> It is good to know the people of this land still pay homage to the olden races.  I bid you well, <name>, and offer you this token. . .  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wanted: Keli'dan's Feathered Stave <|obj|> Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain Keli'dan's Feathered Stave.  <|text|> There is no accounting for taste. Take my most recent buyer for instance. There is a blood orc within Hellfire Citadel known as Keli'dan the Breaker. He bears a most mundane stave; certainly nothing to take a second glance at. And yet, this is what my customer wishes. Who am I to say no? If you desire my compensation, you will find him and his stave within the Blood Furnace.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ring of the Gathering Storm <|obj|> Bring 1 Qiraji Magisterial Ring, 2 Vermillion Idols, 5 Silver Scarabs and 5 Bone Scarabs to Windcaller Yessendra in Silithus.  <|text|> The rings worn by the Qiraji lieutenants are rumored to grant them formidable abilities.  The corrupted gems that adorn them could, in theory, be swapped out with more pure materials to create uncorrupted versions of the rings. The gems that adorn Qiraji idols would work quite well, as their quality is superior. Bring me the ring and idols and I'll create a powerful ring for you, <class>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Down With Daellis <|obj|> Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill Master Daellis Dawnstrike.  <|text|> I'll never forget the blood elf who led the attack. He wore a tabard with a device I've never seen before, over top of crimson armor. He was ferocious and merciless, leading from the front where most other blood elf officers would never be seen. He was responsible for the deaths of many Kirin Tor mages that day, but he didn't linger long at Sunfury Hold. Kael'thas has ordered him to Manaforge Duro to aid in their attempt to control the area. Find him, <name>, and silence his bow for good.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Silver Covenant's Scheme <|obj|> Capture the Silver Covenant Orders.  <|text|> One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Silver Covenant agent gathering information at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something. Go into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to Icecrown before we do.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Reclaiming the Charred Vale <|obj|> Travel to Falfindel Waywarder on the border of Thousand Needles and Feralas.  <|text|> The Bloodfuries have been subdued. But they will regroup soon enough if action is not taken. Far south of the Barrens lies a land known as Thousand Needles. If you travel west in Thousand Needles until you reach the lush forest's edge of Feralas, you will find a druid named Falfindel Waywarder. This great and wise druid is capable of calling forth great forest spirits which can aid in the reclamation of the Charred Vale. Send word of our need! Seek him out at once!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Dearest Colara,  <|obj|> Deliver the Creased Letter to Colara Dean outside the bank in Stormwind.  <|text|> I met a lass in Stormwind when I was last there on the bank's business. She stole my heart away. Now, I can't stop thinking about her! I'd like to send her this message - I've rewritten it twelve times! The mail is so full now, and I want to make sure it gets there. If you're heading that way, could you help me?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Special Surprise <|obj|> Knight Commander Plaguefist at the Chapel of the Crimson Flame has ordered you to execute Yazmina Oakenthorn, an Argent Dawn prisoner inside the nearby prison house.  <|text|> We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house. We weren't expecting what we found in there, <name>. Seems the Crusade's been real busy. That whole thing is full of Argent Dawn prisoners. Most of them were already dead by the time we arrived, but a few were still breathing. I was about to go in there and execute the rest of them, but I think you should have the honors. In particular, there's a real feisty night elf in there that I think you'll take great pleasure in executing.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Fourth Horseman <|obj|> Obtain the Fourth Horseman.  <|text|> The Lich King demands too much! Tirion Fordring deserves more than a life of anguish and undeath! Know this, Deathlord. . . I will obey your will, but there will be no redemption for what we are about to do. The Silver Hand will never hand Tirion to us. The path to the Fourth Horseman will be soaked in righteous blood! Blood that will stain our hands forever. Your will be done, Deathlord. I will begin the preparations to invade Light's Hope. If this is what it takes to save our world, so be it!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Flesh Does Not Lie <|obj|> Recover 20 Plagued Flesh Samples from Stratholme and return them to Betina Bigglezink.  <|text|> The Forsaken apothecaries are not the only beings in this world schooled in the sciences. I have been studying the plague for years, <race>. We had previously thought that the potency of the plague was dwindling, but what I have discovered here in the Plaguelands is startling. The plague seems to be growing in strength! I need to run more tests! The most potent source of the plague is from the tainted flesh of the most recently infected. Travel to Stratholme and bring me samples, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> I'm Not Lion!  <|obj|> Collect a hunting trophy from the lion that Ellias claims to have seen in Pinerock Basin.  <|text|> I've hunted many exotic beasts in my day, but I've never seen a lion like the one I encountered while scouting the basin.

The beast's amber eyes locked on mine, luring me closer. I was helpless to this predator's enchanting gaze. It was only when the lion pounced did the stupor break.

I've told Hemet of this magical beast, but he laughs. I'm not lying, <name>! The lion exists.

If you find the beast, bring me a trophy of your kill, and I'll reward you handsomely.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Calm Before the Storm <|obj|> Communicate Jebotai's orders to the townsfolk of Teerakai.  <|text|> The Nokhud are powerful and have many allies. It will take all we have to withstand them.

<name>, you have the Khanam Matra's trust. Her orders were to rally our friends and prepare our people. 

I need your help. Seek Hojin to mobilize the remaining khansguard. Alert Scout Khenyug to possible Nokhud incursions. Inform Agura to expect wounded, and tell Gensai to prepare our provisions.

As for the mystics, I believe they left recently. I will see if any remain in Teerakai.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Target: Gahrron's Withering <|obj|> Go to Gahrron's Withering in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there, and use its key to gain access to the cauldron.  <|text|> The last cauldron that remains is located on a farm now called Gahrron's Withering.  It is guarded by some of the Scourge's tougher minions - specifically, wraiths and ghosts.  They are not to be trifled with, <name>. Gahrron's Withering is far to the east of the Bulwark, close to where the Eastern Plaguelands begin; again, eliminate the cauldron lord present there for its key.  Here is your empty sample bottle; bring it to me filled.  May the shadows cloak you in safety for this dangerous mission, <class>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> My Very Own Castle <|obj|> Gather 2000 Garrison Resources and then use the Architect Table to select your Town Hall and upgrade your garrison to Tier 3.  <|text|> Commander! Some good news. I finally got that new larger draft paper in that I ordered when we first came here. And do you know what larger draft paper means?

It means I can draw a bigger castle!

And if I can draw it, we can certainly make it! Making it is the easy part, assuming you have a few thousand stones and logs lying around.

So what do you say, sir? Shall we get building?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Securing a Foothold <|obj|> Travel to the Antoran Wastes and place the Lightforged Beacon.  <|text|> Alleria and I have scouted this area before, alongside some of our best soldiers. We stationed encampments on either side of our current position, but I fear they will have come under heavy attack. They need reinforcements. Our first order of business is to set up a teleportation beacon directly below the Vindicaar. From there, we will have access to both fronts. Speak to Romuul when you are ready to head down to the surface.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Penny For Your Thoughts <|obj|> You're good people, commander.  <|text|> You're good people, commander.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> More Fetid Filets <|obj|> Collect 12 pieces of Corrupted Flesh from creatures in areas under assault by N'Zoth's minions.  <|text|> Our little guy is getting hungry again. 

Could you pick him up a quick bite to eat?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Buy Us Some Time <|obj|> Kill 8 Zin'jatar Raiders at Legion's Fate.  <|text|> Many good warriors have been lost today. If what the shaman says is true, then we must act swiftly or we will add to their numbers. The naga are out there, scouring these waters looking for survivors. We are not yet ready to fight, <race>. You must buy us time to make preparations. Find the naga that hunt us and delay their efforts.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> No Mercy for the Merciless <|obj|> Commander Zanneth in Wintergrasp wants you to slay 10 members of the Horde.  <|text|> Welcome to the Wintergrasp, <name>. Your mission is simple. Defeat ten of the Horde's finest. Now, go! Bring victory to the Alliance!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Special Surprise <|obj|> Knight Commander Plaguefist at the Chapel of the Crimson Flame has ordered you to execute Ellen Stanbridge, an Argent Dawn prisoner inside the nearby prison house.  <|text|> We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house. We weren't expecting what we found in there, <name>. Seems the Crusade's been real busy. That whole thing is full of Argent Dawn prisoners. Most of them were already dead by the time we arrived, but a few were still breathing. I was about to go in there and execute the rest of them, but I think you should have the honors. In particular, there's a real feisty human in there that I think you'll take great pleasure in executing.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Socrethar's Shadow <|obj|> Anchorite Karja at Area 52 wants you to obtain the First Half of Socrethar's Stone from Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion and the Second Half of Socrethar's Stone from Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.  <|text|> The infamous eredar, Socrethar, leads the Burning Legion in Netherstorm.  Mentioning his name is enough to make most draenei shudder.  He gives orders from an island in the northwest that only his most trusted lieutenants can access. To get there you will need to obtain a teleportation stone, which won't be an easy task.  The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion.  The second half is held by Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Report to Aubrey <|obj|> Report to Admiral Aubrey in Northwatch Hold.  <|text|> You there! Fresh off the boat? Welcome to Kalimdor, a land hellbent to kill you or die tryin'. There's trouble at the hold - as I'm sure you noticed on your way in. Admiral Aubrey needs all hands on deck if we're to make it through this. Consider yourself drafted, <class>! Follow the road up the hill and you'll find Aubrey in the tower, topside.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Recently Living <|obj|> Slay the Eversong Green Keepers until they yield a Living Branch for Instructor Antheol.  <|text|> You may have noticed the walking trees near Elrendar Falls.  As the keepers of nature, they are infused with a primal magic we can reform to our own purposes using the pure water you have already brought to me. Unfortunately, the green keepers are gnarled and twisted creatures, so you may need to kill a few before you find a useable branch.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Back with the Blues <|obj|> Return to the Azure Archives.  <|text|> It seems I had a good idea.

Now let us hope we can broach the subject of the Isles again. I am glad to see Haleh relaxed. She deserves it.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Unwritten Prophecy <|obj|> These islands will serve as the home to thousands.  <|text|> These islands will serve as the home to thousands. Most of these people will remain here their entire lives. If you so desired, you could do the same. But that's not what you want, is it, <name>? You will do many more great things before you pass. You must embrace your destiny and meet it head on! Before you leave, I present you with two gifts: This tabard is worn by only the most revered of the Hand of Argus and this signet ring worn by our wisest sages. Wear them both with pride, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Gates of Valor <|obj|> Obtain 6 Chipped Titan Disc Fragments by surveying near the Gates of Valor in Stormheim.  <|text|> Ye'd not normally know it, but the terraced entrance to the vrykul's Halls o' Valor is a fine place for findin' ancient artifacts. Problem is, the place is just a big mess with demons at the time. Well, ye've not got much choice. If the disc isn't elsewhere in Stormheim, it most likely lies at the Gates of Valor. Good luck, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Remnants of a Shattered World <|obj|> Recover a copy of "The Curse of Stone" from a Horrific Vision for Wrathion in the Chamber of Heart.  <|text|> The knowledge gained from these visions affords us a unique opportunity to further protect one's mind from corruption.

Seek out those of power within these visions. Should you come across anything of interest do not hesitate to share your findings.

In the meantime, MOTHER and I shall continue our research here in the chamber. 

We await your return, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tomb of Sargeras: Aegwynn's Path <|obj|> Collect 4 Fragment of the Guardian's Seal from the Maiden of Vigilance in the Tomb of Sargeras on Mythic Difficulty.  <|text|> As we sealed the tomb, I entrusted the final piece of Sargeras' prison to the Maiden of Vigilance. If you had it you could move freely throughout the tomb, but I know not what became of the keeper and fear the worst.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Get the Message <|obj|> Capture 6 Orgrim's Hammer Dispatches from Orgrim's Hammer Scouts and bring them to High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker.  <|text|> The Horde is up to something and I don't like it. After the stunt they pulled on the Broken Front, they're capable of anything, and it's up to us to stop it. There's been a flurry of activity in the skies over the Icecrown Glacier, to the west of Aldur'thar and the Ironwall Rampart. Horde scouts and messengers streak in and out on dragonhawks, carrying reports and orders. Take this dart gun and use it to kill the Orgrim's Hammer Scouts. It'll probably work best if you're flying, too.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Just Checkin' <|obj|> To'kini wants you to speak to Bah'kini in Gundrak.  <|text|> There have been fearsome sounds echoing from Gundrak. They have been increasing in volume and frequency of late. My long-time student is currently recording events from inside Gundrak. Perhaps you could find the time to check in on her for me?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Antorus, the Burning Throne: Dark Passage <|obj|> Collect 4 Runes of Passage from Imonar the Soulhunter in Antorus, the Burning Throne on Mythic Difficulty.  <|text|> Despite the dangerous energies pulsing out from the heart of Argus, the Soulhunter travels unhindered through the Burning Throne. Our scouts report that his vessel harnesses the power of demonic runes to safely reach the Hallowed Felworks.

If we obtain those runes, it would allow the Vindicaar to follow the same route. This could save our forces valuable time.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cache and Release <|obj|> Destroy 8 Poisoned Spear Stashes.  <|text|> Even with their leader gone, the Tarasek are unlikely to stop using their poison-tipped spears simply because we ask them nicely. I cannot risk even one of these weapons being used on an unsuspecting traveler.

They will all need to be destroyed. If you did not see any in the caches by the pools, then the Embertooth are likely keeping their spears closer to the source. 

No one else will get hurt because of my carelessness. Enter the cave and destroy any weapon caches that you find.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Champion's Battlegear <|obj|> Bring 15 Cenarion Combat Badges, 20 Cenarion Logistics Badges, 20 Cenarion Tactical Badges and 1 Mark of Cenarius to Vargus at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.  <|text|> The badges you collect from performing combat, logistics and tactical assignments for Cenarion Hold are more than just for show, <name>. You'd be wise to hold on to them.  As you prove your loyalty to our organization I can offer you some of the gear we reserve for our closest allies in exchange for those badges.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Cute and Cuddly <|obj|> Do you love animals? Of course you do, who doesn't? Even the scary ones are pretty neat! You wanna take care of one of the animals I tamed all by myself? I can tame more if you wanna trade for them, too--as long as you promise to take good care of them! .  <|text|> Do you love animals? Of course you do, who doesn't? Even the scary ones are pretty neat! You wanna take care of one of the animals I tamed all by myself? I can tame more if you wanna trade for them, too--as long as you promise to take good care of them!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Shrouded Coin <|obj|> Bring the Shrouded Timewarped Coin to Mistweaver Xia on the Timeless Isle.  <|text|> A swirling mist envelops the coin and it begins to float above your hand. The mist briefly parts to reveal a shiny new coin, yet in the next instant the coin appears worn from years of exchange. As the coin settles back in to your hand, visions of jungles and mist shrouded peaks waft into your mind, and through the vision you recognize the four Celestials gathered in the courtyard of an island.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Withered <|obj|> Slay 12 withered in the Azurewing Whelplands.  <|text|> The withered are the worst kind of pest. They capture our whelplings, knock them unconscious, and then drink whatever mana they can from the helpless babes. Normally our drakes and keepers would fend them off. Today, it looks like we may need your help.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Air Superiority <|obj|> Defeat the djaradin forces and stop their advance in the Battlefield Ruins.  <|text|> <As Ignax looks up, you see a small smile appear on his face. >

Few of my soldiers have experience fighting alongside dragons. What a glorious day.

Their presence gives us confidence, <class>. Now we must put an end to the djaradin's advance once and for all.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> With Hope in Hand <|obj|> Establish a portal to Orgrimmar at the Argent Tournament Grounds.  <|text|> You must bring word of what we have uncovered back to Orgrimmar. One of our mages can open a portal for you at the tournament grounds.

As for the Argent Crusade, we must remain a bulwark against the Scourge. If you wish to continue aiding us, I will see to it that your skills are put to good use.

May the Light protect you, <name>.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mistress of the Claw <|obj|> Find Lea Stonepaw.  <|text|> The great forest guardian, Ursoc, gave his life for this world ten thousand years ago. After the guardian's death his claws were hidden away, safe from any who would use their power for evil. Lea Stonepaw and her Druids of the Claw consider Ursoc their paragon and dedicate their lives to following in his example. If anyone would know where the claws reside, it would be Lea. She and her Druids of the Claw reside in the Tel'Andu Barrow Den just to the north.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Shabby Disguise <|obj|> Use the Shabby Arakkoa Disguise to obtain the Adversarial Bloodlines from Sahaak and return to Hazzik.  <|text|> Open the package, <name>.  It is a disguise.  It doesn't look very convincing, does it? I craft them for ethereal smugglers in search of rare books.  There is an arakkoa scribe who dwells in the central island in Skettis, Terokk's Rest; his name is Sahaak.  He is old and nearly blind. Use the disguise to speak with him and obtain the book known as the Adversarial Bloodlines.  Be careful, <name>.  The disguise won't fool the other arakkoa.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> You've Got Yourself A Deal <|obj|> Return the Signed Procurement Contract to Grizzby in Ratchet.  <|text|> I've signed and sealed the contract, <name>. Tell this goblin he now deals exclusively with the Horde.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Desolate Council <|obj|> Witness the formation of the new Desolate Council.  <|text|> By combining our knowledge and expertise, we've restored the surface of the Undercity to the Forsaken.

It was only possible by setting aside our distrust and acting for the good of our people. Now it's time to make this council official.

We are no longer the same undead that followed and served Sylvanas Windrunner. From here on, we lead ourselves, with the same spirit of independence and pride we've had since we reclaimed our free will.

It's time for a new future, with new leadership.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Promising Beginning <|obj|> Return to Seshuli in Dazar'alor and report on your discovery.  <|text|> <The shrine now repaired, you find yourself eager to seek out the next shrine. Perhaps Seshuli has come across more locations. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Deep Echo Trident <|obj|> Bring the Deep Echo Trident to Paolone.  <|text|> <The trident glistens in the sunlight.

This should give your soulbinds the ability to interrupt their foes in the Path of Ascension. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Hero's Burden <|obj|> Kill Artruis the Heartless.  <|text|> Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done. We need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar. . . the Sundered Shard. The corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway. I'll place the shards and bring the news to Soo-say. . . you will need to find other help in the meantime.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wolves at Our Heels <|obj|> Kill 12 Starving Dire Wolves and 8 Rabid Dire Wolves, then return to Lars at Sven's Camp on the western border of Duskwood.  <|text|> Sven and I have dangerous days ahead of us, what with the Necromancer to the east and all.  And out here alone as we are, we have to hunt for our own food.  It seems every time I'm heading back to camp with some meat on me, starving or rabid dire wolves come out of the forest wanting a bite.  It goes without saying, living out here is dangerous work! But if you can rid us of some of those wolves, we'd have an easier time of it.  They mostly prowl north and east of here, near the river.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> 12 Tickets - Lesser Darkmoon Prize <|obj|> Step right up, step right up! &nbsp; If you have tickets from the Darkmoon Faire you'd like redeemed, then just say so! &nbsp; You can redeem tickets in various denominations for wondrous and fantastic prizes.  <|text|> Here you go, here you go!  A prize fit for a king!  Congratulations to you, my friend! If you have more tickets you'd like to turn in, then please let me know!  For as long as the Darkmoon Faire is here, I'll redeem your tickets.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Doling Justice <|obj|> Kill 12 Grimtotem Naturalists, 10 Grimtotem Raiders, and 6 Grimtotem Shamans before returning to Jer'kai Moonweaver in Feralas.  <|text|> As she's already told you, Kindal and I will now take the fight to the Grimtotem. Together, we should still be able to pick off some of the tauren without much threat to ourselves, but we'd love some help if you're willing and able. You've seen the camp below us, but there are more to the east. Using your own tactics, deal as much damage to the tauren as you can. We can all meet back here after they've felt the sting of Kindal's arrows and your own weapons.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Claiming the Light <|obj|> Use the Shimmering Vessel on M'uru to fill it and return to Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Silvermoon City.  <|text|> Take this vessel, <name>. Invoking its magic will allow you to take this creature's power and claim it for yourself. With it, you will be able to restore your fallen comrade to life. There are those who would say what we're doing is wrong, but much of what has befallen us is also wrong. Would they have us throw away such a gift? They do not complain when our power is used to prevent the further destruction of Silvermoon. No, they object when they are safe from harm and indulging their magic addictions.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Beastmaster's Quarry: The Crane <|obj|> Bring the Ancient Bloodcrown Crane to Huntsman Blake.  <|text|> The ancient crane is alive, but stunned. You should bring it back to Huntsman Blake before it wakes up.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mok'Nathal Treats <|obj|> Collect 3 Raptor Ribs and 3 Serpent Flesh.  <|text|> Hungry, <race>?  The Great Spirit helps those that help themselves.  If you want to earn a meal, I suggest that you listen up, because Braagor there isn't going to give you anything for free, nor as tasty! The raptors and scalewings of Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf have everything that's needed for two of the most delicious dishes you'll ever taste.  Bring me their raptor ribs and serpent flesh, and I'll make some of each for you. I may even teach you how to cook them up for yourself, if you hurry.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Tuskarr Headwear <|obj|> Greetings, dear friend.  <|text|> Greetings, dear friend. You've been so kind to our community here in Iskaara. I have heard of your deeds and wanted to knit you something as a thanks. Please, take your pick! I've made many hats to while away the hours of the long winters. I would be happy to trade you for others as well, if you wish!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Desecrate this Fire!  <|obj|> Desecrate the Horde's Hillsbrad Foothills bonfire! A Midsummer quest.  <|text|> Desecrate the Horde's Hillsbrad Foothills bonfire!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mass Primal Obliterum <|obj|> Oh ho, whatcha got there? Primal Sargerite? Sounds fancy! I bet if we mash some 'o that stuff with Obliterum, we can make it beefier! Give it more of a punch when you apply it to yer armor.  <|text|> <As Caelen takes the stack of Sargerite, you see him fusing it with the stack of Obliterum near the forge. The power radiating from it is quite impressive. >Here you are, lad. Say, ya don't think this stuff is toxic, right?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Alliance Relations <|obj|> Speak to Keldran in Orgrimmar.  <|text|> The fight goes well, <name>. Perhaps the Warchief will allow us to return to our homes before the seasons change if we continue to make such great strides in our battle against the demons and their underlings. Return to Keldran and let him know what we have done. I am sure he will reward you for your efforts here. His cause is important to him, and he will take pride in knowing that the Warchief respects his concerns.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Identifying the Source <|obj|> Slay the experimenting primalist in the Wild Preserve.  <|text|> Judging by what the children have said, we might have a primalist prowling the Wild Preserve.

This calls for immediate investigation.

According to what other researchers have observed, Primalists like to steal eggs and whelps to infuse them with power and corrupt them. Those that don't acclimate to the process suffer a slow death. . . not that the primalists seem to care. . .

We need them out of the Preserve. Attend to that, and I will try to distract the children. They must not know of this.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Honor the Flame <|obj|> Honor the Arathi Highlands flame.  <|text|> Honor the Arathi Highlands flame.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Neltharion's Lair: The Earthen Amulet <|obj|> Retrieve the Earthen Amulet from Dargrul the Underking in Neltharion's Lair.  <|text|> That you were even able to acquire the Egg of Gaiath  is an incredible feat in itself, but the next step may well be impossible. Still. . . it is our only hope. For the ritual to work, we will need to awaken the latent elemental energy resting inside of this egg. There is an item that just may have the ability to do this - a relic known as the Earthen Amulet, rumored to have been created by Loken himself. It was lost many ages ago, and has fallen into the hands of Dargrul the Underking.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Blackwald <|obj|> Investigate the Bradshaw mill just outside Stormglen Village.  <|text|> It took a while, but I think I've put together what happened here.  At least partially. There were survivors of the Curse in this town.  They joined others in the mountains, in Tempest's Reach. Everyone left, except the man who kept the journal, old man Bradshaw.  He noticed that the worgen attacks had stopped all of a sudden and decided to venture into the Blackwald. There is an abandoned mill just northeast of town, it was where Bradshaw lived.  See if you can find any clues there.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Good Ol' Switcheroo <|obj|> Kill Randolph Moloch.  <|text|> Look, I'd love to give the order and have my men blast these rebels to bits right now, but I can't because the entire Stockade is under Warden Thelwater's jurisdiction, and he only wants to contain them right now. Rather than disobey orders, we're going to take care of this in a slightly different manner! We've managed to befriend Mortimer Moloch, who just so happens to be the ruthless rebel leader Randolph Moloch 's twin. Kill Randolph, and we'll switch 'em so Mortimer can stop the rebellion peacefully!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Vinyl: Triumph of Gnomeregan <|obj|> Install the vinyl into the Rustbolt Gramophone.  <|text|> <This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called "Triumph of Gnomeregan. "

You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Alliance Relations <|obj|> Speak to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace.  <|text|> The Burning Blade have many agendas, but know that they are evil to their core, their spirits corrupted, and their destruction is the only way to thwart their objectives. Keldran sent Maurin with me because of his knowledge of the Blade and their warlock ways. He has control of our plots against the Blade while I deal with the other demonic threats here in Desolace. Speak to him, and he will guide you in his designs.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Finest Fungi at the Feast <|obj|> Speak with Warden Captain Sinjoirmi at the Temporal Conflux in Thaldraszus.  <|text|> Fine dining is all about using the finest techniques on the finest ingredients, naturally. The food composed for fine dining is oft locked behind wealth and means, but we would never allow that at The Ruby Feast!

Morsel has informed me of a perfect ingredient for today's theme. One so rare, so exquisite, that it. . . does not exist yet! Tantalizing, no?

The bronze have uncovered a portal to a dangerous future. One where a black truffle with untold flavor exists!

You must go!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Subglacial Refill <|obj|> Collect fish to restock the fishing hole and throw it into an Ice Hole.  <|text|> The fish could be biting better, don't you think?

You know, that gives me an idea. Seems we have caught almost all the fish under the ice. Could you catch some more from the Timbertooth Trail downstream, bring it here, and drop it into an ice hole?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Mysterious Azsharite <|obj|> Collect 5 Azsharite Samples from the nearby cliffs.  <|text|> Azsharite! This mysterious crystalline substance has been used to forge weapons of fel power, but in our hands, we've discovered that it's capable of focusing enormous amounts of energy. It may be the biggest goblin discovery since kaja'mite. But what is it? Where does it come from? Why is it located only here? Science demands an answer! I need more samples to study. Search out Azsharite deposits all along the nearby cliffs.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rustbolt Gramophone <|obj|> Install the gramophone in the Rustbolt bar, The Tipsy Tinkerer.  <|text|> <The large gramophone that you crafted is capable of blasting music across all of Rustbolt.

Now, you just need to find a good place to install it. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Champion: Stormcaller Mylra <|obj|> Uniting the elements won't be easy, Farseer &lt; name&gt; .  <|text|> Uniting the elements won't be easy, Farseer <name>. You'll be needin' all the help you can get! Aye, These are dark times indeed. . . but we'll face 'em t'gether, don't you worry. Ol' Mylra has yer back, Farseer. Now, let's get a move on then! There ain't no time to waste!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Combat Training <|obj|> Train a spell by speaking to a &lt; class&gt; trainer.  <|text|> As you grow in power, so does your capabilities of being a skillful <class>.

You can find trainers all around Azeroth, and in capital cities such as here in Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, or the Undercity.

There's a price to this knowledge, but I will reimburse you just this once. When you are ready, speak with me again to train your abilities.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Hunt the Hunter <|obj|> Slay Warmother Boatema near the Frogmarsh.  <|text|> Please, help us. De Frogmarsh is under siege! My master, de great loa, Krag'wa, is not willing to bend to de will of de blood trolls and their dark god. So now, dey are taking his power by force! Dey are slaying his children and taking his totems of power. Dey will even take Krag'wa and sacrifice him if we are not able to end dis madness!

Stop dem! Slay their leader. Perhaps dat will slow dem down for a while. It will give me time to find a more permanent solution.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Runic Catgut <|obj|> Obtain 3 pieces of Runic Catgut.  <|text|> Let me guess. . . thread troubles? Mm-hm. I suspected as much. My people weave sumptuous silks, but those silks can be fickle about the types of thread they'll accept. Shal'dorei silk has a bit of ley energy woven right into it. You need something that's learned to coexist with the ley energies of this land. I'm talking about owlcats, my good friend! They have what you need. You'll find them amongst the ruins of Llothien.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Demons Among Them <|obj|> Protect the King.  <|text|> It is just as we suspected, <name>! The demons thought they could take us by surprise. Quickly, to arms! Warn the King!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> On the Trail of the Black Prince <|obj|> Enter the Karazhan Catacombs and search for a cure for Ebonhorn.  <|text|> <It looks like a fight took place here. N'Zoth's agents must have already entered the catacombs beneath Karazhan.

The dead lookout still has a set of keys on him. Perhaps they will unlock the door.

With any luck, you can find Wrathion before N'Zoth's agents and gain something that can help Ebonhorn. > <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Killing the Crawlers <|obj|> Slay 6 Cavern Crawlers.  <|text|> Tor'chunk Twoclaws wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with Swamp Rat. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Tor'chunk Twoclaws at once!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wisps of the Woods <|obj|> Use the Swiftwind Switch to collect 5 Talonbranch Wisps.  <|text|> I have toiled long here with the Denmother to spread the teachings of Cenarius and the ways of the wild. She has gained much of my trust, and in return, I have been allowed to introduce the spirits of the forest to her students. The company of wisps is a great honor, as well as a useful blessing. But now the goblins descend on us, and seek to steal the wisps for nefarious use. Please, prevent this blasphemy! Call the wisps back here from the western woods with this blessed branch, and keep them safe.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Champion: High Inquisitor Whitemane <|obj|> There is no greater hatred and scorn in this world than that which exists in my heart.  <|text|> There is no greater hatred and scorn in this world than that which exists in my heart. The Burning Legion will pay for all that they have taken from me. The day of my judgment awaits, but theirs is at hand and I will be the executioner's blade. I will not rest until every demon lays dead, their corpses paving the very ground I walk! Command me to the front, Deathlord and I will rain terror upon the armies of the Burning Legion!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran <|obj|> Deliver the Kirin Tor Signet to Archmage Celindra at The Violet Gate in Dalaran.  <|text|> Hello, <name>. You may or may not be aware that we Kirin Tor moved our city here to Northrend. No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Now the city magically floats above the Crystalsong Forest. We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city. Speak with me again and I will cast a spell of teleportation to transport you there. When you arrive, seek out Archmage Celindra and give her my signet as proof that we spoke.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Get Their Bark Before They Bite <|obj|> Gather 8 Writhebark for Agrikus in Valdrakken.  <|text|> $p, you are a skilled herbalist, are you not? I have alchemists nearly begging at my door. . . well, if I had a door. . . for more Writhebark. We have nearly sold out! 

Will you help me gather more? I fear if the alchemists cannot create the phials they need, they will begin experimenting with my belongings.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Quota to Meet <|obj|> Gather 20 ingots of Mountainfoot Iron from the Mountainfoot Strip Mine in Azshara.  <|text|> Mountainfoot iron is a brittle alloy, but with the right bribes it meets goblin safety standards. Zignibble here is having trouble on the production end of things, but that doesn't change any of my deadlines. I've got a quota to fill! Head down into the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and gather up any ingots of Mountainfoot iron you find. There should be piles of it smelted and ready for shipment.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Shadowy Figure <|obj|> Take the book you found at Sven's farm and show it to townsfolk in Darkshire.  <|text|> I must know who was that skulker in the shadows I saw the night my family was killed! Please, <name>, you have shown your resourcefulness.  Please find that shadowy figure.  I must learn what secrets he holds! I do not have clues that you do not already know, but here - take the book you found at my farm.  Perhaps some of the townsfolk can link this book with its owner.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wisdom of Agamaggan <|obj|> The shaman and geomancers of the quilboar tribes &lt; snort&gt; call upon the strength of Agamaggan to help them in battle and in their rituals, &lt; race&gt; .  <|text|> Your enemies should fear you even more, <race>. Tell Mangletooth tales of your cunning in battle when next we meet--be it in this life, or the next.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Ogre Heaven <|obj|> Speak with Chu'a'lor at Ogri'la in the Blade's Edge Mountains.  <|text|> Now that you have delivered us from bondage, we can begin the process of reunifying the clans.  This will take some time; old grudges are difficult to overcome. But more pressing, you must go to Ogri'la in the heavens above to the west.  You must defend it, and us, from those forces above that the gronn used to protect us from: ethereals, demons, and worst of all, the black dragonflight. When you find ogre heaven, seek out the wisdom of Chu'a'lor on how best to proceed.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Boaring Company <|obj|> Find and rescue 7 Captured Farmers and Farmer Deal.  <|text|> I don't see her body anywhere. That means she could still be alive. The Briarback have been taking prisoners, and anyone who has ever been taken by them was never seen again. We have a single chance here and we need to take it! Come with me into the kraul and free as many of the survivors as you can. And if you can, find Farmer Deal. See if she's still alive.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Prison Revolt <|obj|> You have been instructed to kill 10 prisoners of any type in The Hole, just southwest of Baradin Hold.  <|text|> We have the island, now we need to put the resources here to work.  We found an abandoned cellblock just southwest of here and we need you to go check it out <name>. Reports have come back that it is overrun with prisoners that have been stuck down there for years.  Do whatever you need to do to clear that place out.  Report back to me when you are done.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Audition <|obj|> Craft 3 Drums of the Maelstrom and bring them to Daniss Ghostdancer.  <|text|> Cassandra has spoken highly of your skills, but I need to be certain of what you can do. I mean no offense, this is as much for your benefit as it is our own, as if you are not ready the task could kill you. If you are willing, I would like provide you with a test to see how well you can work leather. Bring me three Drums of the Maelstrom that you have crafted yourself. This will prove your skill and consistency. If your work is up to par, I will inform you of my plan.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Scourge Cauldrons <|obj|> Speak with High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands.  <|text|> Within the lands of former Lordaeron are eight cauldrons - four here in the west, and four more ensconced in the east.  These cauldrons spew poisons into the air, propagating the plague throughout the land for the Scourge. The necromantic might of Kel'Thuzad is too strong to outright shut down these cauldrons, but we think we might have a way to subvert them to our advantage.  My second, High Priestess MacDonnell, will be your point on this assignment; she'll continue the briefing from here.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Up and Running <|obj|> Collect the Assorted Engineering Parts, Prop Rotor, and Transmission Flywheel.  <|text|> The Warsong struck us hard. We lost Telaar, but we have a rare opportunity to strike at the heart of the Warsong. We need your wisdom and leadership to pull it off, <name>. First though, we're going to get our survivors out of Telaar. My rangari are ready to strike. We just need to get you to them. Thaelin has a copter that can get you to them. Unfortunately, his hands are full just trying to keep the infernal thing running. Help him get it up and running?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Operation: Stir the Cauldron <|obj|> Speak to the Thorium Point flight master, then use the Brotherhood Flying Machine's guns to kill Cauldron Defenders until the area is safe for entry.  <|text|> I'm putting you on a flying machine, <name>. You'll be responsible for softening our landing into the slag pit.  Speak with your flight master here in Thorium Point, then fly down to the gorge. Once you near your landing point, there will undoubtedly be hordes of Dark Iron dwarves waiting for you.  Use our flying machine's guns to take out as many of them as you can, then land at the cavern's entrance.  Rendan should be waiting for you by the time you arrive.  <|endoftext|>

If we want Nat to actually come all the way out here, we are going to have to show him real proof of the incredible catches on Draenor.

I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table. This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Saurfang in Orgrimmar. As leader of the orcs, he must have a say in accepting the sin'dorei's pledge. I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement. Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Uncommon Core <|obj|> Collect a Titanic Core from an Ivory Watcher in Uldum.  <|text|> Our scouts have reported that the Amathet are constructing new titanic watchers. 

We had long thought this art was lost to the sands of time. It would appear we were mistaken.

I needn't tell you what a boon it would be to have the aid of watcher constructs in our battles for Uldum. We must unlock the secrets of their construction!

The power of a titanic watcher lies in its core. I ask that you bring one to me, so that our artificers might divine its construction.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Sunfury Attack Plans <|obj|> Lord Torvos in Shattrath wants you to capture the Sunfury Attack Plans.  <|text|> As we press the offensive on Quel'Danas, we've discovered that Kael'thas' minions are planning a counterattack.

<|startoftext|> Bomb Them Again!  <|obj|> Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks.  <|text|> We're still having problems with those flak cannons, <name>. Don't get me wrong -- I think that you did an outstanding job the last time out -- but, that doesn't change the fact that those damned demons seem to be replenishing their ammo supplies faster than we can knock them out.  And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la. What do you say?  Want to take another shot at it?  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Kharan's Tale <|obj|> Listen as Kharan Mighthammer tells his story.  <|text|> Please, hear me out before passing judgement!  <|endoftext|>

I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it. I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits. The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after.  Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire. Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei. Do you and I have an understanding?  <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> Mountain Giant Muisek <|obj|> Kill 7 Land Walkers or Cliff Giants.  <|text|> The last task I will require of you is to travel to the northwest and find the final enemy. The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the burning legion appeared in the world. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain. I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek.  <|endoftext|>

Get to the shore. We need to contact the survivors and find out just what we're up against.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Secrets of Uldum <|obj|> Search the Antechamber of Uldum for an intact artifact.  <|text|> We are ready to enter the antechamber itself, <name>. This is a momentous occasion. From the writings you've brought us, I believe these ruins were in fact once the grand entrance to Uldum itself. The quakes that ripped its doors open have probably collapsed the tunnels, but we may yet find amazing things hidden within. Search the ruins for anything intact that may be studied.  The thrill of discovery awaits!  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Fire Flowers <|obj|> Obtain 5 Luciferns.  <|text|> My fellow druid, Choluna, has asked us to collect any specimens of plant life that we might find here in the Firelands. . . . . .

Willing to take my temporal phase modulator and use it on the nether whelps that hatch from the nether drake eggs?  Retrieve the essences from whatever they turn into.

<|startoftext|> Fiends from the Netherworld <|obj|> Slay 8 Nether Fiends.  <|text|> Those ogre magi inside the Undershell have summoned defenders: fleshling fiends from the netherworld.

<|startoftext|> Futile Pride <|obj|> Kill a Dreadmaul Ambusher in Dreadmaul Hold.  <|text|> This is actually an old orc city. . . one of the oldest on Azeroth.  That is, it was until the ogres pushed us out. Today's Horde refuses to be pushed over by ogres.  My troops and I took the town back by force, and the ogres who once lived here now work as my servants.  Now, our real work begins. You look strong enough, but I'd like to see some proof.  Kill one of the ogres that still besiege us, and return to me.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Formation of Felbane <|obj|> Take the Shipment to Galvan the Ancient in Stranglethorn Vale.  <|text|> The weapons are ready to be forged.

The Frozen Shamanstone should impart the next blessing. Argoram mentions its location in his journal:

"As I was maneuvering away from the great boulders hurled at me by the ogron brutes, I glanced what looked like another monolith atop the tallest of the snow-capped towers in Bloodmaul. Perhaps this is the Frozen Shamanstone, which is thought to grant the Blessing of Frost" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> A Dish for Jogu <|obj|> You know what goes with a good drink? A good meal.  <|text|> Nothing like a delicious cold brew, and some Sauteed Carrots to wash it down.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Omens on the Wind <|obj|> Aid Ohn Seshteng in her ritual.  <|text|> Ohn'ahra does not speak in language as we do. Her voice carries through the very winds. We mystics are trained to feel her presence, follow her call, and interpret her messages.

I have used the materials you gathered to bind totems to this particular call. Aid me in a ritual to center her voice, then I will interpret her song.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Hero of the Day <|obj|> Bring 1 Deeprock Salt and 5 gold coins to the Holly Preserver machine, upon which you will receive 5 Preserved Holly.  <|text|> Listen. . .

We've got a machine that preserves holly - it never goes bad!  We use it to spice up the holiday. . . and profits during the summer! I'll let you use the preserver, but only if you're a master cook.

<|startoftext|> Minions of N'Zoth <|obj|> Defeat 20 minions of N'Zoth within the vision.  <|text|> The howling winds that surround us may some day be drowned out, masked by these increasingly dark, yet familiar whispers.

We will find Tyrande, no matter where this course leads.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Rear Guard Patrol <|obj|> Kill 8 Bleeding Horrors and 8 Wandering Spirits, then report back to Linnea at her camp.  <|text|> The defenders on The Bulwark protecting Tirisfal from the Plaguelands are on constant alert.  But sometimes Scourge will slip past them. Our success at the Bulwark depends on a one-front battle - we cannot allow an attack from the rear, nor can we allow our defenders' supply line to be cut. Assist the Bulwark.  Patrol east and slay any Scourge you find.  Spend particular effort at the Balnir Farmstead to the east.  It has become a haven for interloping Scourge.  <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> The Sea Out West <|obj|> Speak with Sugarbough at the Shady Sanctuary in the Ohn'ahran Plains.  <|text|> Enjoying the greenery around our little scenery, <name>?

It reminds me of a dish I once tasted from a pair of dryad sisters and their kind treant friend. Sugarbough was their name! A resident of Shady Sanctuary on the western coast of the Plains.

It was a medley of fresh herbs, veggies, and spices. At the heart of this dish was the most delicious layer of sea kelp you have ever tasted!

What? Never tasted sea kelp before? Well you simply must seek some out. And bring back enough to share, please!  <|endoftext|>

We fought alongside them with a weary heart, knowing they would betray us one day. Admiral Proudmoore's death was not enough to stop his legacy of deceit. The human scum had his plans well laid out before he ever met his demise. His reign won't even die with Benedict it seems. Who knows how long it will be before the next waves of Proudmoore's men land upon our shores. We need to get these orders to Vol'jin in Orgrimmar immediately! He can be found in Thrall's chamber.  <|endoftext|>

Above the glyphs is what I can only assume to be a code of some sort. This code might very well be the key to summoning the emissary. I will create a copy of the glyph code that you must use in the sand at the Bones of Grakkarond. If I am right, the Overlords will come thinking that new data is ready for transmission.

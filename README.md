# Automated Quest Generation for RPGs

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and accompanying files for the project on automating quest dialogue generation in role-playing video games (RPGs) using Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT-2). The project was conducted as part of the coursework for CMPT 713.

## Introduction

The project explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly open-source pre-trained models like GPT-2, to automate the creation of quest dialogues in RPGs. This approach aims to reduce the time and resources typically required for manual quest creation, thereby streamlining content development without compromising narrative quality.

## Motivation & Background

The video game industry is increasingly adopting procedurally generated and machine-learning-based content to enhance the dynamism and expansiveness of gaming experiences. However, dialogue and narrative development often still rely on traditional, labor-intensive methods. This project proposes the use of GPT-2 and GPT-2 Medium for generating immersive quest dialogues through both fine-tuning and prefix-tuning techniques.

## Project Goals

1. Develop repeatable methods for collecting NPC dialogue datasets and ensure open-source access.
2. Fine-tune the GPT-2 model to generate unique, context-aware quest descriptions based on quest titles and objectives.
3. Employ a novel prefix-tuning approach with the GPT-2 Medium model to achieve similar ends.

## Results Summary

The project successfully demonstrated that GPT-2 models could be fine-tuned and prefix-tuned to generate engaging and contextually relevant quest narratives. This approach shows promise for reducing the dependency on manual content creation in game development.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the potential of LLMs to significantly impact content creation in video games, offering a scalable alternative to traditional narrative development processes. The successful implementation of both fine-tuning and prefix-tuning methods suggests a viable path forward for integrating AI-driven content generation into mainstream game development.

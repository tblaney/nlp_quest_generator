He had control over my will and my body.  The Cult of the Damned serves Arthas in life. . . willingly. Now that we know the words of power to enter Naxxanar we can put an end to the cultist blight.

6,Keristrasza,Keristrasza wants you to speak to her when you are ready to prepare for a confrontation with Malygos. ,"I am. . . free? I was destined to spend an eternity roaming an empty abyss, and now am saved? You cannot fathom my gratitude, mortal. When I refused to bend to his will Malygos bound me to that prison, then shattered it and scattered the pieces. Should I live one hundred of your lifetimes, I shall not forget this kindness. Perhaps, in time, I will find ways to repay you. For now, though, we must focus our attention on Malygos. I am weak, and there is much to be done. I need your help, <name>. "

That's where you come in. I want you to get me everything on this shopping list. Please. "
8,Saragosa's End,"Keristrasza wants you to use the Power Focus to lure Saragosa, and then defeat her. ","Using the mana crystals you provided, I have created this Power Focus. Saragosa is a glutton.

Prepare yourself, <name>, and speak to me again when you are ready to face Saragosa. "
9,What the Cold Wind Brings. . . ,Take Ith'rix's Hardened Carapace to High Overlord Saurfang at Warsong Hold. ,"You hold the carapace fragment of Ith'rix the Harvester and realize that this is only the beginning. Even now you sense that victory is fleeting. Surely the Lich King has a thousand more beasts like Ith'rix, waiting to be unleashed upon the Horde.

10,Preparing for the Worst,Utaik wants you to gather 8 Kaskala Supplies in Kaskala. ,"Dark times are upon us.  Karkut's spirit walks the earth and gathers the spirits of dead tuskarr. The sons of the mist have taken many of our brethren.  Soon dear Kaskala will be reduced to ashes. There is hope yet.  Not for us perhaps, but we've sent our families to Unu'pe.  We fight here so there may be a future for them. They will need supplies or they will starve.  There's not enough food in Unu'pe.  Salvage any supplies before it's too late for our families. "

12,Too Close For Comfort,Endorah wants you to go to Amber Ledge north of Warsong Hold and thank those there for rescuing her. ,"I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me? I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts - I was surrounded! A magical box appeared above me, opened up and pulled me inside. Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of red drakes. It was breathtaking! I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, find them, and pass on my gratitude. "
13,Hellscream's Champion,Seek out Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village. ,"You have faced all challenges that have been set before you and squashed them beneath your boot heel.

Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires. "
16,Bait and Switch,Keristrasza has asked you to collect 10 Crystalized Mana Shards from around Coldarra. ,"During my captivity I was able to learn much about Malygos. Fate now allows us to use this knowledge against him. There is a great blue dragon, Saragosa, who circles high above the Nexus. She serves both as the aspect's guardian and as his consort. If any serious threats arise, she alerts her master of the danger. I suffered greatly at the hand of Saragosa during my captivity, and now her time to die has come. First, however, we must fashion the perfect bait. . . . "
17,Patching Up,Fezzix Geartwist at Taunka'le Village wants you to bring him 5 Steam Cured Hides. ,"Remember all that gnomish duct tape you brought me? Well, I've found a use for it. The body of this flying machine is so banged up in places, that I'm going to need to reinforce it if I ever hope to fly. Dorain over there has been telling me that the taunka use steam cured caribou leather for making watertight containers. Marsh caribou live all around the village and in the Flood Plains to the south. Get the best hides you can find and cure them over the steam vents in the Geyser Fields. "

Mages all across Azeroth are being abducted and I have been authorized to conscript anyone able to assist in the unraveling of this mystery.

20,Load'er Up! ,Help Jenny make her way from the crash site to Fezzix Geartwist at Taunka'le Village without losing all her cargo. ,"Have you seen the flying machines buzzing around? That's gnomish innovation at its finest. I've long waited to get my hands on some of their technology and a perfect opportunity has presented itself. One of their recon wings crashed in the Scalding Pools, in the southwest part of the Geyser Fields. Blow this whistle near one of the crashed machines and my trusty mule, Jenny will answer.

Vurenn was right.  The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen. Take this oculus.  Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura.  Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens. "
22,The Cell,Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to obtain the Prison Casing from General Cerulean and the Energy Core from Warbringer Goredrak. ,"You've discovered a fragment of a special prison, <name>. Malygos' minions use similar prisons to hold their captured mages and other arcane entities, but this prison was constructed to hold something. . . stronger. In hopes that the enemy of our enemy will prove to be a friend, you must search for the prison's remaining fragments. They are likely to be in the possession of Malygos' most trusted underlings. "
23,Monitoring the Rift: Winterfin Cavern,Librarian Garren at Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at Winterfin Caverns. ,"I need to compile my notes and prepare a presentation for my colleagues in Dalaran.

My documentation will be incomplete without it. "
24,Hampering Their Escape,"Etaruk, outside the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to destroy the North Platform, the East Platform, and the West Platform. ","I'm sure you've seen those blue and white platforms hovering over the quarry. They're the transportation the mage hunters used to land their forces here, and now they're loading them up with our artifacts and fragments of our statues. We must stop them before they leave the quarry. The small creatures digging in the quarry carry explosives. Take them and use them to destroy the three floating platforms. The leader keeps watch from a fourth, grounded platform, but we'll deal with him afterward. "
25,Finding the Phylactery,Go to Death's Stand and ride Dusk to the location of Tanathal's Phylactery. ,"No time for small talk, <name>.  I was sent on what was to be a suicide mission to take this ziggurat.  I've accomplished my duty as a soldier, now is the time to get some answers. This lich has knowledge I seek, yet I cannot inflict pain to his physical body to obtain that knowledge. The lich stored his soul in a phylactery, and while it remains hidden, I won't be able to pry the information from him. Return to the camp and take my horse, Dusk, she will lead you to the phylactery.  Bring it to me. "
26,Gammothra the Tormentor,Slay Gammothra and return the Head of Gammothra to Primal Mighthorn at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra. ,"Magnataur live in prides, much like lions: one or two dominant males and several females along with their offspring. In the case of Gammoth, the magnataur den west of here, Gammothra is the leader. It is Gammothra that controls this magnataur population and therefore it is Gammothra that must be slain to prevent any type of magnataur uprising. Take this pouch of crushed bloodspore flower to Gammoth. Use the powder from the pouch to weaken Gammothra and then slay him! Return his head to me as proof. "
27,Corastrasza,Librarian Serrah wants you to speak to Corastrasza in Coldarra. ,"Greetings, <class>. Might I impose on you for a favor?

28,Get Me Outa Here! ,Escort Bonker Togglevolt to safety and then report in with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle at Fizzcrank Airstrip. ,"I knew they'd send someone for me sooner or later. . . turned out to be later, of course. I came in here to parlay with the snobolds, but their main shaman, Kaganishu, decided instead that I'd make a tasty snack for Magmothregar. Wait. . . what? ! They didn't send you? ! DID THEY FORGET ABOUT ME? ! Okay, you're here now and that's all that matters. As soon as you break this chain we'll make our way back to the airstrip. Then you can tell Fizzcrank I'm safely back. If he remembers me, that is. "
29,Words of Power,"Thassarian at the Wailing Ziggurat wants you to go to the Temple City of En'kilah and retrieve High Priest Talet-Kha's Scroll from the Spire of Pain, High Priest Naferset's Scroll from the Spire of Decay and High Priest Andorath's Scroll at the Spire of Blood.

Return once you've obtained the three scrolls. "
30,Horn of the Ancient Mariner,Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to bring him the Horn of the Ancient Mariner. ,"A Kvaldir lieutenant known as Orabus directed the initial incursion against my people at Pal'ea, He oversaw the destruction of both villages and then disappeared into the mist. In those early days there was talk of a horn that Orabus gifted to the Kvaldir mistweavers. This horn could be used to summon him should the need arise. We need to get that horn from the Kvaldir mistweavers and call forth Orabus. If he is destroyed, these savages might retreat. Seek out mistweavers at Pal'ea, to the south. "
31,Reading the Meters,Archmage Berinand at the Transitus Shield has asked you to collect the readings from his instruments in Coldarra. ,"I had hoped that the Nexus' impact was limited to this region. Recently though, reports have flooded in from all over Azeroth suggesting that geologic instability is growing exponentially! I need the Nexus monitored regularly as I work to develop a solution. I've placed sensitive instruments around Coldarra, disguised as Malygos' scrying orbs. One lies in the trench near the Nexus, and three are hidden in the structures around the valley's perimeter. Visit each and return to me with their readings. "
32,I'm Stuck in this Damned Cage. . . But Not For Long! ,"Collect an Engine-Core Crystal, a Magical Gyroscope, and a Piloting Scourgestone. ","The cultists magicked me into this cage and there's no door to it. Little did they know that I'm the chief transmatter engineer for the airstrip! With your help, and a little elbow-grease, I won't be in here for long. I'm going to need an engine-core crystal from one of the ghouls in here, a magical gyroscope from their doctor, and a piloting scourgestone from the lich-lord up top. With all of that stuff, I should be able to make a port device to get back to Fizzcrank's and escape the gnome way! "
33,Herald of War,Report to Thrall at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar. ,"The Warchief needs you, champion. Orgrimmar is in a state of martial law.

35,Karuk's Oath,Karuk wants you to slay 6 Skadir Raiders and 5 Skadir Longboatsmen. ,"They call themselves the Kvaldir.  My people have legends about them; we call them the tuk-hariq - walkers of the fog. My village was destroyed by these giant mist-men.  Everyone I knew was slain, including my father Ariut. By tuskarr law I must seek retribution against those who shed my kin's blood. I am but a fisherman and I've not yet passed the test of manhood. . . I cannot stand toe-to-toe with the vile Kvaldir. If you were to carry out my blood duty for me, I will be in great debt to you. "
36,Wind Master To'bor,Report to Wind Master To'bor at Warsong Hold. ,"You're a tough mother, <name>. I think your talents are better suited elsewhere - like the root of the whole damn problem! <Razgor points to the west. >A thousand Scourge, at least four full sized floating death machines and who knows what else. But you're gonna find out and then you're gonna handle it. . . That's right, you're gonna beat the hell out of the Scourge army that's currently beating down our door.

This will be our best opportunity to gather information about the enemy's fortifications and leaders. While wearing the cloak, scout the three large spires on the grounds of the city.

40,Traversing the Rift,Surristrasz wants you to travel to Coldarra. ,"I've been mindful of your efforts, mortal. Do not feign surprise. Surely you've felt my eye upon you.

46,Basic Training,Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to slay 10 Coldarra Spellweavers. ,"This is war, mortal, and we are the tip of the spear. Your little spats over land or currency pale in comparison to this conflict. We face the aspect Malygos and his entire blue dragonflight. All you need to know is that if he is victorious, this world shall be no more. We are but few here, and we fly against many. Our deaths are all but a certainty, and our ultimate success lies in merely delaying our enemy. Go now. Busy yourself while I decide what to do with you. "
47,Puzzling. . . ,Bring the Scintillating Fragment to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield. ,Something about this scrap of metal prevents you from casting it aside. Perhaps Raelorasz might be able to shed some light on its purpose.

I asked my nephew, Iruk, to bring me Issliruk's totem, but the Kvaldir's spears struck him down and his body fell into the waters to the north.  Bring me the totem, <name>.  Don't let my nephew's death be in vain. "
51,The Spire of Blood,Search the Spire of Blood for more information about the Vial of Fresh Blood. ,"As you inspect the captured blood vial, you realize its contents are still warm.

As much as I hate to disturb Lord Surristrasz, he's our only hope of saving our beloved Evanor. Bring him the key fragments and hope that his mood is favorable. Hurry, <class>, our assault team is waiting. "
60,Cracking the Code,Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to get the Azure Codex from Inquisitor Caleras and collect 3 Shimmering Runes from his Coldarra Spellbinders. ,"I sense a distinct peculiarity in the drakes here but the meaning of the runes that cover their bodies still eludes me. Without a codex, it will take more time than we can afford for me to interpret them. Not far from here is a Kirin Tor traitor, Caleras, who is likely to have a copy of the tome I require. His underlings hold the runes I will need for my translation. Hurry, mortal. Malygos gains strength with every passing moment. "
61,Aces High! ,Corastrasza on the upper ring of the Nexus in Coldarra wants you to ride her drake and kill 5 Scalesworn Elites. ,"You possess the courage to draw so near to Malygos' lair, mortal? Or is it simply ignorance? Soon we shall know. . . . I am a seasoned trainer of the graceful drakes of the red dragonflight. My business here is to study the enemy and teach my precious pets the tactics that will be most effective when we face the master of the blues. To demonstrate your nerve and ability, I will allow you to ride one of my drakes against the enemy's minions. The opportunity is yours for the asking. . . "
62,Bring 'Em Back Alive,Farmer Torp at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to rescue 8 Infected Kodo Beasts. ,"Take this riding snaffle, <name>. You'll notice that I've placed a tiny medicine dispenser in the mouthpiece. That thing will cure the infection as soon as a kodo bites down. Once you've cured the sick out of 'em, you'll need to ride 'em home. They'll be weak so you'll need to gently direct 'em here. Bring my babies back, <name>! One last thing, you've got ten minutes! That's how long the antidote will remain effective inside that snaffle. "
63,Surrender. . . Not! ,King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat has asked you to bring him a Claw of Claximus. ,"The time has come to put an end to this unnatural situation, <name>. For the Winterfin murlocs to have a chance at a future, Claximus must die! I want you to take my spare murloc suit and enter the Winterfin Caverns under the pretext of surrender. With the white flag in hand, the murlocs won't attack you. You'll find him in the southwestern most corner of the caverns. Once you get close enough, deal with Claximus. Bring me one of his claws as proof that the grisly deed has been done. "
64,"It Was The Orcs, Honest! ","While disguised as a Warsong orc, plant the Warsong Banner in the corpse of Magmothregar. ","With all of those outfits you, er, recovered, I fashioned a Warsong orc disguise. I had the genius idea of combining it with some old stuff that I had left hanging around from last Hallows' End, so it should be foolproof! Here, in this sack is the disguise and the banner you recovered. Head down into the bowels of Magmoth and slay the magnataur chieftain, Magmothregar. If you're going to convince them to turn their attention on the Warsong orcs, you'll need to plant the banner while disguised. "
65,"Ned, Lord of Rhinos. . . ",Killinger the Den Watcher at the D. ,"West of here, on the high bluffs above Lake Kum'uya, roams a despicable being known as Nedar. The self proclaimed ""Lord of Rhinos"" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - rhinos unable to defend themselves against Ned's cowardly attacks. To add insult to injury, Ned has raised a rhino of his own to become his mount and bodyguard. It is a rare thing that D. E. H. T. A. would ever call for the death of an animal, but Ned's tainted rhino must be disposed of. . . Kill them both and return to me. "
66,Magic Carpet Ride,Talk to Yanni at Warsong Hold to arrange safe travel to the coast. ,"Tanks, mon. I be talkin' bout siege machines! We got heavy tanks stationed at Garrosh's Landing on da west coast. We gonna get you to da tank and you gonna use da tank to lay down some Horde justice on da Scourge! Da only tricky part be getting' you der. No way we be sendin' you on our wind riders. Too risky. You see dat pixie o'er der? Dat blondie elf? Yanni be his name, mon. He can get you to da coast, safely. Once der, talk to Annihilator Grek'lor! "
67,The Mechagnomes,Listen to Fizzcrank Fullthrottle's tale and then find Jinky Wingnut at Fizzcrank Airstrip. ,"Now that you're here, it's time for me to tell you the full story of what's going on. After you've heard my tale, go outside and find my second-in-command, Jinky Wingnut. She'll handle everything from here on out. "
68,Rescuing Evanor,Anzim on Amber Ledge wants you to fly with his war mages to free Lady Evanor at Beryl Point. ,"At last, we attack! Once we've cleared the platform I'll use the key. You are to ensure that Lady Evanor remains safe after her release. Hurry now, let us be off! "
69,Cutting Off the Source,Overlord Razgor at Warsong Hold wants you to destroy 10 Nerub'ar Egg Sacs. ,"Aerial reconnaissance of the quarry reports that the Nerubians are storing their eggs on the scaffolding surrounding the base. Smart beasts these are. . . They're keeping the eggs high and dry, away from the epicenter of conflict. You're going to have to go back out there and track down their eggs. Find 'em, smash 'em, and trash 'em. Each egg destroyed means twenty less Nerubians feeding on our corpses. "
70,Grmmurggll Mrllggrl Glrggl! ! ! ,Mrmrglmr wants you to return to him at Winterfin Retreat with Glrggl's Head. ,"If your pathetic little eyes were any good, you'd see that we're being slaughtered by the orcas to the north in the bay! Assuming your precious night elf king wants his spare costume back, I think you'll do me a favor and bring back the head of the king of the orcas, Glrggl: he who swims against the tides of fate -- eradicating the hope of life for all those who hear the siren song of death upon the waves! Be quick about it, <race>, Winterfin murlocs are losing their lives even as we waste time talking! "
71,Abduction,Donathan wants you to use the Arcane Binder on a wounded Beryl Sorcerer at Beryl Point and return to Amber Ledge with him. ,"<name>, we have a situation. I've just learned that one of our archmages en route from Dalaran has gone missing. Naturally, we suspect the mage hunters are behind her disappearance. Time is clearly of the essence. We must know what has become of Lady Evanor at once if we are to have any hope of rescuing her. Take this device. Return to Beryl Point and use it on a Beryl sorcerer when he is near death. It should bind him long enough for you to bring him here for questioning. "
72,The Wondrous Bloodspore,Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover 10 Bloodspore Carpels. ,"We are witnessing something amazing here, <race>. A whole undiscovered ecology lives and breathes not more than a few paces from us! I surmise it is the bloodspore plant that sets this environment abuzz. I have collected some pollen from the nearby male species of bloodspore plant but still lack female receptors for pollination. Fetch me a bushel of the bloodspore carpels. You'll find them near the larger plants surrounding us. Be wary of their guardians! The kobolds won't give them up easily! "
73,Keep the Secret Safe,Librarian Serrah in the Transitus Shield needs you to kill Arcane Serpents near the Nexus and collect 5 Nexus Mana Essences from them. ,"Our existence here depends entirely upon staying hidden. Should the shield fail, even for a moment, Malygos' minions would have us. One of my responsibilities is to rejuvenate the warmages' mana levels so their focus doesn't falter. With our supply lines lost, I've been forced to improvise. I could use your help, <name>. Very near the Nexus, Arcane Serpents feast on the abundant magical energies. Once defeated, they will yield a mana essence that I can make use of. "
74,The Tides Turn,Elder Muahit wants you to kill Heigarr the Horrible in Njord's Breath Bay. ,"The spirits have heard our cry for help, <name>.  It's a sign that Kaskala might yet be saved. Take advantage of the confusion the weather has created and slay the Kvaldir leader.  Your actions will sway the battle in our favor, I am sure of it. "
75,Cruelty of the Kvaldir,Speak to Karuk about the Captured Tuskarr Prisoner. ,"I thank you for saving me, <name>.  The kvaldir are animals! They made us fight the other prisoners.  It would've been more merciful to just kill us all. The youngling Karuk is still alive -- I noticed him arrive here.  Tell him his father fought until the end. "
76,Coward Delivery. . . Under 30 Minutes or it's Free,Take the Alliance Deserter to the crossroads east of Warsong Hold and fire your Warsong Flare Gun to signal the Alliance. ,We're seeing more deserters show up at our gates with each passing day. We simply do not have enough room to keep all of these maggots caged up. Especially not if we want to keep the pigs happy. <Nork snorts as he laughs. >I want you to escort one of these cowards to the crossroads east of here and fire this flare gun. One of their captains will show up when they see the flare and take the coward off your hands. Report to Scout Tungok on the east road once the delivery has been made. 
77,Gamel the Cruel,Karuk wants you to defeat Gamel the Cruel at Riplash Strand. ,"My own father was slain by the leader of this raiding party, Gamel the Cruel.  He has made his abode inside a cave on the beach. You've dealt with his men already.  Finish what you've started, <name>.  Avenge my father and I will share with you what little I still have. "
78,Find Bristlehorn,Find Longrunner Bristlehorn at Talramas. ,"Bristlehorn should have returned by now. The other reason why we came up here was to investigate that Scourge structure to the west, which fell from the sky. He's impetuous and has likely gotten himself into trouble. <name>, go to that place and find him, please. "
79,Secrets of the Ancients,Archmage Berinand in the Transitus Shield wants you to collect 3 Glacial Splinters and 3 Magic-Bound Splinters from the Ancients in Coldarra. ,"It's become clear that the instability in the region has had an effect on its indigenous creatures. I've taken a particular interest in the Glacial Ancients and their recent adaptations. I suspect that their transformation into these 'Magic-bound' Ancients may hold clues to our predicament here. For my studies, I'll need samples from both. Do hurry. . . . "
80,Hatching a Plan,Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to kill Coldarra Wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break 5 blue dragon eggs. ,"Our goals here are simple. We are to remain hidden from Malygos, observe his brood, and thwart his efforts wherever possible. To that end, I have a task for you. The blues are laying their eggs at the base of the Nexus. Exposure to so much arcane energy will surely make them hatch sooner, and there's no telling what effect it will have on their spawn. I don't intend to find out. Slay the local wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break the eggs. "
81,Keymaster Urmgrgl,Glrglrglr inside the Winterfin Caverns has asked you to retrieve Urmgrgl's Key. ,"I have to get out of these caverns! There's magic stuff seeping in from Coldarra, above, and affecting everyone's minds. I don't intend to be controlled like these others! Keymaster Urmgrgl is in the cave below and to the south. He holds the key to my cage. Get it from him and bring it back so that I can unlock my cage and get out of here. Hurry! "
82,The Horn of Elemental Fury,Reclaim the Lower Horn Half and Upper Horn Half from Chieftain Burblegoggle and Chieftain Gurgleboggle and bring them to Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village. ,"I can fashion the likeness of an elemental from these pieces of inanimate stone, but breathing life into it is different. For that, we'll need help and a bit of luck. Legend tells of an ancient artifact called the Horn of Elemental Fury, sought after by a great hero. I'll lend you a scroll with a copy of the tale. I don't know if the legend is true, but it's our best bet. If the legend is right, the parts of the horn may be in the Flood Plains surrounding the village to the north and southwest. "
83,Into the Mist,Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Kvaldir and recover 8 Tuskarr Relics. ,"Across the mist to the north you will find Garrosh's Landing. To the south are the ruins of my old home, Pal'ea. Both have been ransacked by an ancient force known as the Kvaldir. These fearsome savages slew all of my people without mercy and drove your people inland. All that remains of the tuskarr of Pal'ea are our personal effects, taken as relics by the Kvaldir. While we are not a vengeful race, justice must be served. The tuskarr relics must be returned to me. Enter the mist and find them. . . "
84,We Strike! ,Help Longrunner Proudhoof and his Warsong raiders to survive the assault upon Steeljaw's Caravan and finish off the spirit of Force-Commander Steeljaw. ,"One of your orcs named Steeljaw tried to save some time by taking a shortcut through our burial grounds. This had better not be how your Horde normally acts, <race>, or you will find the taunka to be the end of you! But, you look as if you want to help fix this situation. Good! Steeljaw's cursed spirit now haunts this place and disturbs the remains of my ancestors. We must put an end to him! If we live through this, tell your Overlord Bor'gorok at the outpost to the north. Are you with me? "
85,Reclaiming the Quarry,"Etaruk, camped near the entrance to the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to kill 12 Beryl Treasure Hunters. ","You're a welcome sight, <class>. My name is Etaruk, and I used to be a craftsman here at the Coldrock Quarry. My companions and I were preparing a new set of statues for their last set of rites when we saw those mysterious blue platforms come flying over the plateau. When they landed, the mages they carried swarmed the quarry, murdering my fellows and plundering the quarry. If we don't stop them, they'll destroy our statues and make off with our artifacts. Will you help me defeat the invaders? "
86,Mustering the Reds,Keristrasza has asked you to bring her to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield. ,"Malygos is certainly aware that something is amiss. I know him. His focus is fragmented. I am confident that I can lure him from the safety of his realm when he learns what has become of his precious Saragosa. Take me to Raelorasz at once, <name>. He must rouse every dragon he commands to face Malygos. "
87,A Soldier in Need,"Medic Hawthorn, outside of Valiance Keep, wants you to go inside the Stormbreaker's hold and retrieve Hawthorn's Anti-Venom from a crate of First Aid Supplies. ","You there!  Please, I need your help.  This soldier will succumb to the cryptfiends' venom unless we act immediately. I've managed to slow down the poison, but without a suitable supply of antidote I cannot counteract it. I was promised a new shipment of anti-venom in the Stormbreaker's most recent trip from the south.  Go inside its hold and search for a chest of first aid supplies. Hurry, <class>!  We can't afford to lose any more men unnecessarily. "
88,The Trident of Naz'jan,Veehja in Riplash wants you to go to the far northeastern end of the Riplash Ruins. ,"Five hundred years ago, Azshara imprisoned a being named Leviroth in the waters below.  Now these barbarians seek to undo our queen's work! They took over our city and began to sacrifice my brethren to awaken him!  When they ran out of naga, they began to take tuskarr.  Their spirits will know no peace! I will help you, for it will go a long way towards quelling my vengeance.  Their captain, Ragnar, dwells deep inside northeastern Riplash.  He has in his possession a golden trident.  Bring it to me! "
89,Bury Those Cockroaches! ,"Quartermaster Holgoth at Warsong Hold wants you to use the Seaforium Depth Charge Bundle to destroy the Nerub'ar sinkholes to the south, east, west and north of Warsong Hold. ","North, south, east and west. Those are the locations that you should be concerned about. Surrounding this fortress, within Mightstone Quarry, are four perfectly situated Nerub'ar sinkholes. <Holgoth hands you a bundle. >Be very careful with that package, <name>. Mishandle it and you'll be dog meat. Inside the bundle are seaforium depth charges. Get to each of those Nerub'ar sinkholes and plant a depth charge at their center point. If all goes well, the tunnels will collapse. Get a move on! "
90,The Defense of Warsong Hold,Report to Overlord Razgor at the hut on the south side of Warsong Hold. ,"Hellscream has the weight of the Horde upon his shoulders. Do not be dissuaded from your duties because of his temperament, <name>. <Saurfang nods. >Did you think that I would forget the name of a hero of Orgrimmar? It is not every day that I have the pleasure of putting the head of Nefarian on a pike! The Scourge have begun their assault upon this fortress. Our soldiers steady the line, but are in desperate need of backup. Report to Razgor. He is stationed directly outside of Warsong Hold. "
91,Get to Getry,Find Shadowstalker Getry at Warsong Farms. ,The Scourge agent that's overseeing the abduction and transformation of Horde soldiers into undead monsters is using the northwest farm as a spawning glade. Shadowstalker Getry has been staking out that monster for the past week and has gathered some vital information that might allow us to end this menace. Get to Getry and see if you can help him put a stop to this Scourge assembly line. You'll find Getry at the abandoned tower on the northwest border of these farms. 
92,Not Without a Fight! ,Ataika wants you to slay 12 Kvaldir Raiders in Kaskala. ,"Kaskala is a sacred place for us, <race>.  Our ancestors were guided here by the spirit of Tayutka herself. Now these foul creatures attack us from the mists without any provocation. We will show them that our spears are not merely for whaling.  Fight alongside us, friend.  Perhaps my people might repay you some time in the future. "
93,A Visit to the Curator,"Etaruk, on the outskirts of the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to kill Curator Insivius. ","The leader of the mage hunter forces is a fearsome creature called Curator Insivius. My people have hunted the beasts of the seas and land for countless generations, but I've never seen anything like this curator before. He's landed one of those flying disks on the upper rim of the quarry and oversees the operation from there. <name>, I can only believe the ancestors themselves sent you to my rescue and I hope you will help me drive the mage hunters from this quarry once and for all. "
94,Nuts for Berries,Librarian Serrah in the Transitus Shield wants you to gather 10 Frostberries from the Frostberry Bushes in Coldarra. ,"Oh! What a relief it is to see a fresh face. I was beginning to feel we had been forsaken. Our supply lines were cut off days ago, and things have been looking - well, bleak. To be honest, this was a suicide mission to begin with if you ask me. Maybe I'm simply not cut out for all of this violence - to say nothing of the bitter cold! I'd much rather be back in Dalaran studying ancient texts. To the point, our food supply is nearly spent. Please, gather what you can and bring it to me. "
95,The Nefarious Clam Master. . . ,Slay Clam Master K and return to Hierophant Cenius at the D. ,"It's despicable, really, to anoint one's self as the ""Clam Master, "" as if they hold mastery over the creatures of the sea. None may make such claims! This ""Clam Master"" must be found and slain. He was last seen at the wreckage just off the coast of the Abandoned Reach. Find him and kill him. Once this is done, return to Hierophant Cenius at the D. E. H. T. A. Encampment, north of here, and let her know that the mission was a success. "
96,The Defense of Warsong Hold,Report to Overlord Razgor at the hut on the south side of Warsong Hold. ,"Do not let Hellscream dissuade you from your duties as a soldier of the Horde, <race>. He bears a terrible burden in these frozen wastes, with the outcome of his charge resulting in victory over the Scourge or the extinction of all life on Azeroth. It is for this reason that we require your strength and wisdom. The Scourge have begun their assault upon this fortress. Our soldiers steady the line, but are in desperate need of backup. Report to Razgor. He is stationed directly outside of Warsong Hold. "
97,Khu'nok Will Know,Take the Orphaned Mammoth Calf to Khu'nok the Behemoth in the Borean Tundra. ,"Although you have acted valiantly in freeing the trapped calves, many of them will still die. You see, without a caretaker, these calves must fend for themselves in the wild. But there is a way! Hope yet remains! North of here in the mammoth fields, bordering the Scalding Pools, you will find Khu'nok the Behemoth: a mammoth as wise as he is ancient. Take this mammoth orphan and present it to Khu'nok. He will know what to do. "
98,Enemies of the Light,Harbinger Vurenn wants you to fight the Cultist Necrolytes near Farshire to the north of Valiance Keep and retrieve the Cultist Communique from them. ,"Not so fast there.  I don't know about you, <class>, but I was hardly convinced by the general's words.  They rung unsure. . . as if they were not his own. Something's amiss here.  All of our efforts to collaborate have been blocked and delayed.  It is time we took a more independent approach. If we're to learn more about the cultists inside the keep. . . perhaps we should investigate those outside. Intelligence reports a small group of them aiding the Scourge north of here.  See if they carry any clues. "
99,The Sub-Chieftains,"Defeat Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder, and then report back to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village. ","It is known that Gearmaster Mechazod has four sub-chieftains that manage the robots in the pools. We must put an end to them! Our longrunners and snow trackers say that if you were to turn the valves at the west point, north point, mid point and south point stations, each of his sub-chieftains would come quickly to prevent you from fouling their operations. The stations are centered on the spinning lights in the pools surrounding the pumping station. Hurry, <name>! "
100,The Collapse,Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village wants you to collapse the Nerubian sinkholes using the Horn of Elemental Fury and defeat Lord Kryxix. ,"I have created and bound Alluvius using the Horn of Elemental Fury. He will respond to the horn's call when you stand near the southernmost sinkhole in the Geyser Fields. The quake Alluvius will unleash should collapse the Nerubian tunnels and put an end to their flanking attack. I wouldn't be surprised if the Nerubian commander showed himself after the quake. If the collapse of the tunnels doesn't break the back of their assault, the defeat of their leader surely will. "
101,The Gearmaster,Research the Gearmaster's Manual and return Mechazod's Head to Fizzcrank Fullthrottle. ,"Gearmaster Mechazod is insane! He says that he offers us immortality by removing this so-called 'Curse of the Flesh', but what he's really making are robotic slaves! <name>, we're pretty certain that he's still at the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the east. The last we saw of him, he was in the command hut up top. Go up there and research his stuff. You must confront Mechazod if gnomes everywhere, . . . no, everyone everywhere, are to stay alive! "
102,The Fall of Taunka'le Village,Speak to Mother Tauranook outside the gates of Taunka'le Village. ,"We are lost, <name>. This place has been our home for many generations, but it is no longer safe. There remains only death. . . Death and a memory of what used to be. I have called for the evacuation of Taunka'le. All remaining taunka must leave at once and make their way to our capital city, Icemist, located in the Dragonblight. <Wintergale points east. >You must help get my people to safety, <name>. Mother Tauranook awaits you at the village gates. Hurry! The Scourge closes in from all sides! "
103,The Art of Persuasion,Librarian Normantis on Amber Ledge wants you to use the Neural Needler on the Imprisoned Beryl Sorcerer until he reveals the location of Lady Evanor. ,"It is fortunate you're here, <race>. You see, the Kirin Tor code of conduct frowns upon our taking certain 'extreme' measures - even in desperate times such as these. You, however, as an outsider, are not bound by such restrictions and could take any steps necessary in the retrieval of information. Do what you must. We need to know where Lady Evanor is being held at once! I'll just busy myself organizing these shelves here. Oh, and here, perhaps you'll find this old thing useful. . . . "
104,The Culler Cometh,Zaza at the D. ,"Near the southern end of this bluff is where you will find the treacherous leader of the caribou trappers. She is a savage like no other, making a mockery out of the carcasses of the slain animals: drinking from their blood and howling to the moons! Find this murderer, Karen, and end her worthless existence. Prepare yourself properly, <name>. Karen the Culler has indulged in the riches that Nesingwary has lavished upon her! She will be well armed and guarded by lackeys. "
105,The Silver Covenant's Scheme,Capture the Silver Covenant Orders. ,"One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Silver Covenant agent gathering information at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something. Go into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to Icecrown before we do. "
106,The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran,Deliver the Kirin Tor Signet to Archmage Celindra at the Violet Gate in Dalaran. ,"Hello, <name>. You may or may not be aware that we Kirin Tor moved our city here to Northrend. No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Now the city magically floats above the Crystalsong Forest. We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city.

108,The Sunreaver Plan,Obtain the Sunreaver Orders. ,"One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Sunreaver agent buying reagents from a dealer in the Black Market area. The Sunreavers normally aren't known for their interest in what goes on down in the sewers, so that's a big indication that they're planning something. Head into the Underbelly, find this Sunreaver agent, and take care of him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let them get it back to Icecrown first. "
109,Proof of Demise: Titan Rune Protocol Gamma,Archmage Lan'dalock in Dalaran wants you to return with the Defiler's Medallion from any final dungeon boss. ,The Lich King's presence mustn't extend any further!

113,Sealed Vial of Poison,Bring the Seal Vial of Poison to Alchemist Cinesra in the Dalaran Sewers. ,This vial of poison looks particularly dangerous.  Perhaps someone in Dalaran might be interested in it. 
114,Waterlogged Recipe,Bring the Waterlogged Recipe to Christi Stockton in the Dalaran city. ,This appears to be the remains of a mixture for potent wine.  Perhaps the proprietor of One More Glass in Dalaran would be interested in it. . . .

116,Defending Wyrmrest Temple,"Devrestrasz at Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to slay 3 Azure Dragons, slay 5 Azure Drakes, and to destabilize the Azure Dragonshrine while riding a Wyrmrest Defender into battle. ","Emboldened by the overabundance of magic now flowing through the Azure Dragonshrine, the blue dragonflight has dared to attack Wyrmrest Temple itself! I ask that you ride one of our defenders into battle to slay their dragons and drakes, and to attack the eruption of ley line energies at the dragonshrine itself in order to destabilize it. Outside on the east and west terraces are wyrmrest defenders. Speak with one to ride it into battle. Without your help, <name>, we will surely lose. "
117,That Which Creates Can Also Destroy,"Lord Itharius at the top of Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to destroy a Weakened Reanimated Frost Wyrm, Weakened Turgid the Vile, and Weakened Overseer Deathgaze. ","Since we only have three seeds, we must put them to the best possible use. Your targets are one of the reanimated frost wyrms circling to the north near Galakrond's Rest, Turgid the Vile in the ruined barracks at the Carrion Fields to the east, and Overseer Deathgaze at Jintha'kalar far to the northeast. While the seeds would outright destroy one of the lesser Scourge, they will greatly weaken these three. Enough so, in fact, that you should be able to handle them on your own. "

121,One of a Kind,Find and kill Bonesunder in or near the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine. ,"Such a strange seal to see among magnataur. . . it suggests an unusual amount of organization. Magnataur rarely put aside their aggressive natures to cooperate with each other.  I suspect they have their eyes set on raiding a large settlement.

The Scourge to the south are digging up some ancient dragon thing.  I could care less why they're doing it, but they're pulling cartloads of composite ore in the process.

I've sent one of my best couriers to our outpost in western Dragonblight, but he has not yet returned. I fear he may have fallen to the Scourge. Will you go to Dragonblight and search for him? Courier Lanson is his name. "

My agents tell me that several of our good citizens have seen fit to fall into the hands of the Scarlet Onslaught. This will not do.

140,Reclusive Runemaster,Locate Dregmar Runebrand near his cave on the path to the cliffs overlooking the Mirror of the Dawn. ,"Dregmar Runebrand is a magnataur runemaster. . . a rare breed. He's generally solitary, but has been known to associate with the more powerful and influential magnataur in Dragonblight for quite some time. He will know who this new leader is.

","Magnataur are hideously violent creatures. . . this is the main reason we rarely see them come together in any real numbers without killing each other. A powerful leader has stepped up somewhere among them and we need to hunt him down if we are to stop this threat. I will start asking around. I need you to disrupt them as much as possible in the meantime. East of here there are 3 torches erected. Near them, there are 3 dominant Magnataur - put them down to buy us some time to hunt down this leader. "
147,A Strange Device,Deliver Goramosh's Strange Device to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest. ,"Picking up this strange device, you are certain that it is magical in nature.

148,Planning for the Future,Collect 12 Snowfall Glade Pups. ,"We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain. The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance.

149,My Old Enemy,Deliver The High General's Head to Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Wintergarde Keep. ,"My old enemy, High General Abbendis, has come to Northrend. Somehow she survived the attacks upon Tyr's Hand and brought a small force north. They've established New Hearthglen to the south. While they could prove useful in fighting the Scourge, Abbendis herself is far too shrewd an opponent to let live. Trust me, if we let them stand, she will be at our throats before the dust settles. So, we'll deprive them of their leadership and go about our business. Bring me her head as proof. "
150,Need to Know,"Spy Mistress Repine at Venomspite has asked you to steal the Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Abbey, Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Barracks, and Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Beach. ","I need to know what New Hearthglen is up to. I want you to steal their orders of the day so that I can find that out.

153,Really Big Worm,Enter the Ice Heart Cavern and slay Rattlebore. ,The jormungar have a spawnmother in the caverns below. We call her Rattlebore - a name that was gifted to her by an adventurer from the Plaguelands. I saw her only briefly as I was fighting off their initial onslaught - she is large enough to make even my icy bones shiver. This cavern will not be ours until she is removed from it. Gather your friends and end this. 
154,Projections and Plans,Get close to and observe the projection atop the Surge Needle floating above Moonrest Gardens. ,"This is a teleportation device. If I had to guess, I'd say that it leads to the surge needle platform floating above the Moonrest Gardens to the west. I need you to use it to investigate what's up there. It appears that the device works both ways so you shouldn't have to jump off. I expect that once you teleport to the top of the surge needle, there will be some sort of apparatus on it to observe. You should be able to use the teleporter from anywhere within the gardens. "
155,Wanton Warlord,Travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine and blow the Emblazoned Battle Horn. ,"There's no reason to suspect Dregmar's words are anything but true.

When Grom'thar the Thunderbringer arrives, kill him and bring me his head. "

I want more information and you are going to get it for me! After the land was destroyed at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the mage hunters there.

While your story is far from over, I'll be damned if it's not already turning out to be the stuff of legend! No matter what happens to us when this is all over, what you've done at Wintergarde will be a tale told for years to come.

Rothin the Decaying is resurrecting black dragons as magmawyrms in the back of the cave. Go to the summoning chamber and cleanse the remaining bones in the only way that will ensure that they will never be toyed with again. . . with flame. Burning the bones will surely gain Rothin's attention, see to it that he is destroyed as well. The magic in this vial should see the task done. "
163,Meat on the Hook,Slay Tu'u'gwar and then return to Tua'kea at Moa'ki Harbor. ,"The time has come my friend: Tu'u'gwar must be dealt with! I've prepped the meat so that the beast is sure to come once you bait the hook I have out in the water. Just follow the fishing line here down to it. Whatever you do, don't let Tu'u'gwar swallow you whole, <name>! "
164,Atop the Woodlands,Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Amulet and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus in the Lothalor Woodlands. ,"I'm convinced that there must be more of those foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though. My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the southeast. Once again you'll need to find the person in charge and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own.

Korialstrasz calls upon his allies in a futile attempt to save their Ruby Dragonshrine, but it seems the good graces of the red flight don't extend to saving the shrines of the other flights. Surprised? I'm not. There is another of my brood who has left to clear our Obsidian Dragonshrine of the undead vermin that now infest it. All it would take to prove yourself more noble and righteous than Alexstrasza herself is a quick jaunt over there and a few swings of a blade. I'm amused. "
168,Galakrond and the Scourge,Speak with Torastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight. ,"Atop the Wicked Coil, the Grand Necrolord of the Scourge, Antiok, sits upon the shoulders of the reconstructed storm giant lord, Thiassi.

Rather, they're after the past version of you that defended the Hourglass of Eternity. You remember, right? That was you back then, except it's you now too. Wait, that's not important.

Once there, set the dynamite and blow up the entrance. Remember to do this for the upper and lower entry points of Wintergarde Mine. You must leave nothing to chance. The evil that exists here must never be allowed out. Light guide you. "
174,Return to the Earth,Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through one of the northern or southern passes and search for Ruby Acorns. ,"I have another task that needs attention. I have brothers who are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the emberwyrm ranks. Get into the shrine through one of the other passes to the south or north. . . the Scourge presence should be lighter there. Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life. . . a proud fate for any of my kind. "
175,End Arcanimus,Destroy Arcanimus and then return to Ethenial Moonshadow at Moonrest Gardens. ,"There is one last thing that I would have you do, <name> the <race>. I would have you destroy Arcanimus! The sorcerers to the west used that giant device in the sky to bore a massive pit into our resting place. When they did that, they unleashed a monstrosity! I would not care if it were only a concern for mortals, but Arcanimus feeds upon the spirits of the dead. You will put an end to it now! "
176,The End of the Line,Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under Lake Indu'le. ,"Within his robes you find two things of interest. One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named Sidragos, which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the Moonrest Gardens. The water-soaked parchment informs Goramosh that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine. Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge. "
177,The Focus on the Beach,Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Ring and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus on the Glittering Strand. ,"The mage hunter forces are active on the Glittering Strand to the south of Moonrest Gardens. My guess is that you'll find a heavily guarded focus on the beach and a captain who is in charge of it. No doubt the captain will have some sort of controlling device on their person. Get the controller and use it on the focus. With any luck, we'll be able to get some more information about what they're really up to out there. "
178,The High Executor Needs You,Speak with High Executor Wroth at Venomspite in Dragonblight. ,"It's a good thing that I intercepted this request from High Executor Wroth before it got to Overlord Agmar. What is Wroth thinking? <The sergeant rips up the letter that he's holding. ><class>, go see what it is that the high executor wants. Follow the road east and pass through The Dragon Wastes. You'll find a path leading up out of the wastes on the southeast side, and the Forsaken town, Venomspite, will stand before you on the south side of the mountain. "
179,To Fordragon Hold! ,Venture to Fordragon Hold in Dragonblight and speak with Highlord Bolvar Fordragon. ,"With the Naxxramas war machine stopped dead in its tracks the time has come for you to help our forces at Angrathar, the Wrathgate.

Take the north gate out of town and travel north by northwest until you arrive at your destination. Light protect you! "
180,Imprints on the Past,Zelig the Visionary at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to recover his Scrying Orb. ,"The memories of the past haunt this land, <name>. I hear the cries of the fallen echo across Northrend - calling to me. Arthas left a terrible imprint on everything he touched. Only wither and decay remains in his wake. It is important, then, for us to study the past so that we may better know our enemy. Perhaps untold truths shall surface that could help in our campaign. First, you must recover my scrying orb from the town hall, <name>. Exit this tower and turn left down the path to reach the town square. "
181,In Search of the Ruby Lilac,Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to collect 1 Ruby Lilac. ,"How fortuitous it is that the Ruby Dragonshrine lays just to the east. It is there that you will find a flower called the ruby lilac. This lifegiving plant is all that I need to concoct a vaccine for the untainted beasts of this region. Travel east and search the Ruby Dragonshrine for the lilac. Just one thing: The dragonshrine, like all the dragonshrines in this blasted wasteland, is beset by the Scourge. Watch your step. We wouldn't want you to be devoured by an emberwyrm. <Sintar laughs. >"
182,Finality,Take Thel'zan's Phylactery to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight. ,"Thanks to your heroics, Lord Fordragon has given the command to launch a full assault against Thel'zan. 7th Legion have made their way into the summoning chamber of the mausoleum and located what appears to be a gateway to hell. The only piece that's missing now is you. Take the phylactery and report to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum. There is a tunnel that the Scourge dug out just outside the keep that you can take to get to Yorik quickly. Go now, <name>! Lead us to victory! "
183,Into Hostile Territory,Speak with Gryphon Commander Urik to secure a ride to Thorson's Post. ,"You have done much to advance our efforts against the Scourge, <name>. In fact, the morale of all those who have come into contact with you soars! Such is your influence over the soldiers and citizenry of Wintergarde, ally. And because of you we are now prepared to go on the offensive! You are to report to Duke August Foehammer, across the Carrion Fields at Thorson's Post, east of here. Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station has prepared a special gryphon to drop you behind enemy lines. Go now! "
184,No Place to Run,"Place a Destructive Ward at the end of the path leading out of Obsidian Dragonshrine, where the road starts to give way to snow. ","They're drawing power from the bones of my dead brothers. . . I have no love for the cult, but I'm baffled by their audacity. There will be no mercy shown for them. . . not that I ever would have anyway. Ensure that they have no place to flee when the slaughter starts. Place a destructive ward at the end of the path leading out of the shrine. . . where the road starts to give way to snow. Defend it until it is fully charged. "
185,Spiritual Insight,Speak with Toalu'u the Mystic at Moa'ki Harbor after you have attained your spiritual insight. ,"<race>, we have not heard from our people at Indu'le Village since the ground shook and was torn apart! Have you ever been upon a vision quest? You've bested Loguhn, so you must be capable. I will give you a special incense to sprinkle into my brazier. Breathe deep from its vapors and your spirit will be sent aloft to view what has transpired at Indu'le. As your spirit soars, I will be able to look through your eyes. "
186,Strength of Icemist,Find Banthok Icemist at Icemist Village. ,"< Greatmother Icemist bows. >It is an honor to meet you, hero. It is because of your actions that many of us are here now, alive and ready for battle against the Scourge. You have done so much for us that it shames me to ask you for your assistance once more. Despite my pleas, my only son, Banthok, left here to go in search of his father, High Chief Icemist. He was last seen heading west, towards Icemist Village. Please find Banthok. I do not know what I would do if I lost my son. "

For five years - whenever I would feel anger, anxiety, or sorrow over the events that transpired here - I was to focus my thoughts upon the orb. I now understand why Zelig gave this crystal to me. Take my crystalline orb to the Forgotten Shore. Find the ruins of my old base on the upper reaches of the beach and place the orb in the center of town. Let the forgotten see the world through my heart and soul. "
190,A Means to an End,Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to use the Levine Family Termites to lure Foreman Kaleiki out and kill him. ,"I received a few barrels of termites from my sister at the Bulwark back home in the last shipment. I think they're going to come in handy for something I have in mind for you. The lumbermill operations at New Hearthglen are problematic for us, but so far we haven't been able to get anyone in there to take out their foreman. I think that if you were to unleash these termites on his precious woodworks, he'd be sure to come running. Ready to take him out, <class>? "
191,Prevent the Accord,Deliver Wind Trader Mu'fah's Remains and the Scales of Goramosh to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer. ,"We need to kill two birds with one stone here, <class>. You're the stone. Our two birds are Wind Trader Mu'fah and Goramosh. They should be somewhere in the western half of the Moonrest Gardens. Most likely they're in the larger two-story building overlooking the pit. I require proof of their demise, if you would be so kind. "
192,Victory Nears. . . ,Speak to Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer. ,"There remain only two primary threats that stand in our way. One is the dread citadel of Naxxramas, far to the east, above the Alliance fortress of Wintergarde and the other is the Pit of Narjun, exit point for the undead armies of Azjol'Nerub. It is from the Pit of Narjun that the Anub'ar Nerubians assaulted and ultimately razed the taunka village of Icemist. We will destroy the Anub'ar and close off the Pit of Narjun. Report to Senior Sergeant Juktok for your mission orders. "
193,Hard to Swallow,"Battle a Hulking Jormungar east of Nozzlerust Post until it opens its mouth, then throw a Potent Explosive Charge into its throat. ","Those troops are sure to be needin' a hefty supply of food in their bellies. I'll let you in on a little secret that a squeamish <race> like you would never know. . . those jormungar worms taste just like chicken. Go provoke one of those giant hulking jormungar to the east.  You're not likely to be able to kill one straight out, so just toss this down its throat when it opens its mouth wide.  Bring me back as many of the slabs of meat as you can tote. "
194,The Power to Destroy,Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to enter the world of shadows and defeat 6 Shadowy Tormentors. ,"While you have done much for me, one task remains. Beside the world you know exists another world. It is from that world, the world of shadows, that my tormentors assault me. While I am powerless to face my own demons, you could end their reign of terror. You have the strength, I have seen it with my own eyes. Enter the world of shadows and face the demons that torment me! Do this and I will translate the tome, as promised. "
195,Heated Battle,"Aid Captain Iskandar in holding the canyons by participating in the death of 12 Frigid Ghoul Attackers, 8 Frigid Geist Attackers, and 1 Frigid Abomination Attacker. ","The Scourge have overrun the shrine. The shrine's keeper, Dahlia Suntouch, is nowhere to be found. The red wyrms that fell in the shrine's defense now beset us in the form of twisted skeletal emberwyrms. The situation is dire, <race>. Captain Iskandar leads a group of your kind in stemming the flow of the Scourge out of the shrine. Go to his aid. . . but please stay behind his men. The flow of Scourge is endless and I don't want to lose you in one of those scarred canyons. "
196,Plunderbeard Must Be Found! ,Ambo Cash at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight wants you to find Plunderbeard. ,"There's been talk of a tunnel dug by Scourge that connects the embalming chambers of the mausoleum with the large crypts, now unearthed by Thel'zan and his minions. I recently sent my best rogue, Plunderbeard, in search of answers, but have yet to hear back from him. If I were a betting man I'd wager that he's a goner. I want you to go down those steps and head straight through the embalming chamber and look for Plunderbeard. Dead or alive, he'll have answers. "
197,All Hail Roanauk! ,Seek out Roanauk Icemist at Agmar's Hammer and initiate him as a member and leader of the Horde forces. ,"Like the tauren, Forsaken, trolls and blood elves, so too do the taunka need a leader born of their own blood.

The ground? <whispering> Actually, they do if you can find a horse graveyard. But we don't have one of those, so what we need you to do is go south to New Hearthglen, kill the knights, take their riding crops, and steal their warhorses.

The hungering dead stream out from what remains of Old Wintergarde. Commandeer a vehicle from the east gate and drive it northeast through Vengeance Pass until you reach the twin towers at the southeastern edge of Wintergarde. Drop the blight bomb on the undead that cover the area. Report back to me with the results! "
201,Gaining an Audience,Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to Tariolstrasz at Wyrmrest Temple. ,"<name>, you must travel as swiftly as you can to Wyrmrest Temple and present this letter to the steward, Tariolstrasz. The temple sits in the center of the Dragonblight. Follow the road east until it ends, and then cross The Dragon Wastes to get to it. I'm sure that when the steward reads your introduction, he'll see to it that you gain an audience with Queen Alexstrasza. We can only hope that we're not too late. Thank you for all that you have done on our behalf. Safe journeys! "
202,The Call Of The Crusade,Report to Crusader Valus at Light's Trust in Dragonblight. ,"<class>! The Argent Crusade is looking for able bodied soldiers that are willing to set aside their differences and join forces to battle the forces of the Lich King. Will you take up our cause?

Farewell. "
203,The Steward of Wyrmrest Temple,Speak with Tariolstrasz at Wyrmrest Temple. ,"You've proved that you're to be trusted and more. You should return to Wyrmrest Temple and speak with the steward, Tariolstrasz, once more, <name>. "
204,Disturbing Implications,Bring the Emblazoned Battle Horn to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in assessing the potential threat. ,The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and a lightning bolt.

I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle. "
206,Containing the Rot,Soar Hawkfury at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to kill 15 Infected Wildlife and recover a Rot Resistant Organ. ,"With Scourge comes death and disease. We often overlook that the wildlife of a Scourge infested area is ravaged and ultimately destroyed by rot and contagion. For most of the indigenous beasts of the Dragonblight it is too late. The festering disease that the Scourge brings has already infected the beasts and they are now rabid and rotting. You must venture west, towards the Pit of Narjun, and cull the infected wildlife. Check their corpses for a preserved organ as we need one to devise a vaccine. "
207,The Best of Intentions,"Wait for Serinar to administer the disguise of a Burning Depths Necrolyte, then proceed to the back of the Maw of Neltharion to uncover what the Cult of the Damned is doing there. ","The Cult of the Damned has not come just to extract power from dead dragons. I suspect I know what they are up to, but I need you to prove me correct. I will grant you the guise of this dead necrolyte. Proceed to the back of the cave and confirm their intentions for being in this sacred place. I will watch through your eyes. Be cautious <name>, any damage done to you is likely to break the fragile illusion. "
208,Emerald Dragon Tears,Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to collect 8 Emerald Dragon Tears. ,"With an inert specimen of the blight compound complete and the activating agent in hand there only remains a need for a suitable shell to house the components. Southwest of here, on the shores of central Dragonblight, is where you will find the Emerald Dragonshrine. Within the shrine you will find the hardened remnants of a green dragon's tear drop. I don't know the whole story, but apparently they cry a lot right before they die. Go figure. Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and gather tears. "

Go now, <name>! Race the winds! East to Agmar's Hammer! "
211,A Strange Device,Deliver Goramosh's Strange Device to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer. ,"Picking up this strange device, you are certain that it is magical in nature.

212,Cycle of Life,Nishera the Garden Keeper at the Emerald Dragonshrine has asked you to slay 5 Emerald Skytalons. ,"Ysera sleeps in the Emerald Dream, watching over both the Dream and Azeroth. But a horrible nightmare has taken hold in the Dream, and now I fear that Ysera is being affected by it. Recently, I asked her to aid in the fight against the Scourge that are raising frostwyrms at the other dragonshrines. She misunderstood. Instead, she told our dragonshrine's defenders to treat those not of the green dragonflight as enemies. I need you to slay some of the skytalons. The shrine must regain its balance. "
213,Let Nothing Go To Waste,Retrieve 6 Stolen Moa'ki Goods from the wolvar. ,"The wolvar have always been our natural enemies. But the incursion of your peoples into the Great Dragonblight has forced them into a small space upon the glade to the north. Combined with the land's upheaval this morning, they have become even more aggressive than ever before. They have made several raids upon our goods. . . things that we'll need if we are to survive the trek from our home here.

215,The Forsaken Blight and You: How Not to Die,Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to bring him 10 Ectoplasmic Residue. ,"The details behind the functionality of the blight are hardly important. All you need to know is that it does the job it was designed to do. I have managed to synthesize a strain of the blight that is inert. <Middleton uncorks a vial and inhales. >See, my body is still, mostly, intact. Now mix this with a reactive agent and we'd all be turned to shapeless piles of goo. On the beach south of here you will find pathetic specters of Alliance soldiers past. Slay them and bring me ectoplasmic residue. "
216,Filling the Cages,Samir at Granite Springs wants you to use the Bounty Hunter's Cage on a drakkari troll that's been stunned by Budd. ,"'Ol Budd's seen better days. Ever since our stay in Ghostlands he's been useless to us. We've had to find ways to make it on our own, and today that means sellin' trolls to the highest bidder. Fortunately, we've recently found a use for Budd. Something about his condition allows him to mingle with the local trolls, so we taught him a little game that's turned us a tidy profit. See for yourself. Talk to Budd, take him southwest to Drak' Zin Ruins and use this cage as soon as he tags a troll. "
217,The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling! ,Defeat Ironhide inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward. ,"So you're interested in the fights, eh?

218,Seared Scourge,Mack at Granite Springs wants you to use his grog to burn 20 Famished Scourge Trolls at Drak'Tharon. ,"<Hic>. . . gotta burn these corpshes 'fore they shtart walkin' around again.

Now we will learn whether our efforts will accomplish what we need or nothing at all. Take these ashes and seek the furbolg that Kodian told you about, Tur Ragepaw, near Ursoc's Den.  You will find the den to the north of Grizzlemaw. Convince Tur to aid you, for you will need all the help you can get. Once you've defeated the bear god, use these ashes over his body. Even if his worldly form is destroyed, his spirit must be saved. "
222,"Ursoc, the Bear God",Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to find Tur Ragepaw near Ursoc's Den and defeat Ursoc with his help. ,"It is time, <name>.  Take these ashes and look for the furbolg that Kodian spoke of.  If he went to seek Ursoc, he will be near his den, north of Grizzlemaw. You will need his help.

224,Free at Last,"Use Gavrock's Runebreaker to free 4 Runed Giants, then return to Gavrock at the Ruins of Tethys. ","The rock shard you imbued should be powerful enough to break the runic magic binding my brothers. Take it with you and find the runed giants walking north along the Eastwind Shore. Unleash the power stored in the stone and observe the results. If it works, the runed giants should return to their senses and stop obeying the iron dwarves.

225,Subject to Interpretation,Drakuru wants you to get 5 Frozen Mojo from the Drakkari Trolls at the Ruins of Drak'Zin and then use the elixir at Drakuru's Brazier there. ,"A legendary set of artifacts, lost for thousands of years, were created to make Drak'Tharon Keep impervious. Most think they be myth, but Drakuru knows better, mon! I nearly discovered where one be, but got captured while interpreting hieroglyphs. Ya gotta summon my soul back dere so I can finish readin' em! Use my elixir at da brazier on Drak'Zin Ruins, southwest of here. You'll hafta mix in da frozen mojo my bruddas be holdin'.

We can't let that happen.  You see, the prisoner matches the description of Mikhail's older daughter in his diary. If we set her loose and follow her closely, she'll lead us to whoever's controlling the trappers.  Take this letter to her. "
229,"Chill Out, Mon",Gan'jo wants you to collect the Snow of Eternal Slumber from his chest in the Drakil'jin Ruins. ,"It be as the prophecies said, mon. A <race> <class> be comin' to set our spirits to rest. We been waitin' for a long time now! The Drakkari have become a lost people, fierce and savage. But here we suffer by no fault of our own, mon. This place need cleansin' and only the living can do it. Speak to me when ya be ready to rejoin your body. Then take the snow from the chest near me here and put my bruddas to sleep. Take their remnants to your spirit guide. He be knowin' what to do next. "
230,The Thane of Voldrune,Use Flamebringer to defeat Thane Torvald Eriksson and report to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge. ,"Now that you've captured the flame-imbued talismans and weakened Voldrune's defenses, we can strike at its leader, Thane Torvald Eriksson. The thane's favorite mount is an unruly proto-drake he calls Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the talismans, you should be able to control it long enough to use it against the thane. Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and show him no mercy. "
231,My Enemy's Friend,"Conqueror Krenna in Conquest Hold wants you to slay 8 Silverbrook Hunters and their leader, Vladek, at the Forest's Edge Post. ","If there is one thing I can get through your head, let it be this: the Alliance will be crushed in the Grizzly Hills. There is far too much lumber, ore, game and strategic territory for us to give up on any single battlefront here. So far we've been successful. . . but there's something that could tip the scales in our enemy's favor. Far to the east  of here, at the Forest Edge's Post, local trappers seek to join the Alliance.  Slaughter them before they have the chance to do so. "
232,Jin'arrak's End,Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to collect the Sacred Drakkari Offering from the Drakil'jin Ruins and use the Drakkari Spirit Dust on it. ,"It is good to see you back among the living. Many who travel the path of the dead do not return to speak of it. While you were away, a vision appeared to Kraz revealing what remains to be done. A sacred offering lies somewhere inside the crypt. Take this spirit dust fashioned from the remnants you collected and use it on the offering. The infused offering will bring an end to the corrupted warlord and will release the many tormented souls. May the spirits guide your actions, <name>. "
233,The Thane of Voldrune,Use Flamebringer to defeat Thane Torvald Eriksson and report to Sergeant Nazgrim at Conquest Hold. ,"With the flame-imbued talismans, we can finally challenge the thane. His favorite mount is a ferocious proto-drake called Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the power of the talismans, you should be able to bend it to your will and use it against the thane. Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and use Flamebringer to destroy him. "
234,Dun-da-Dun-tah! ,"Escort Harrison from Drakil'jin Ruins, then speak with Harkor at Harkor's Camp. ","Listen, kid. This is no place for you to be playin' around. I'm about to make a break for it. Stick with me and I'll get you outta here. "
235,My Heart is in Your Hands,Drakuru wants you to bring the Heart of the Ancients to him at Drak'atal Passage. ,"<Drakuru's voice fills your mind. >Hey, mon! Dis eye of da prophets be great! I been usin' it to watch ya and I see ya got da heart now! Not bad. . . . Now ya just gotta bring it to my brazier at Drak'atal Passage, a short walk east of ya. Ya must drink my elixir at da pedestal to summon me there. This time, ya need ta mix in some desperate mojo from the defenders there for it ta be workin'. "
236,The Conquest Pit: Final Showdown,Defeat Krenna in the Conquest Pit and speak to Gorgonna for a reward. ,"You must've really upset Krenna.  She and Gorgonna have had a spat and you're wanted in the pit immediately. There are some wild rumors that it's a fight to the death!  That would be bad news for you, but great news for our business venture! At any rate, you can't run away from fate. . . best get in there on the quick and get it over with. "
237,Scourgekabob,Prigmon at Granite Springs wants you to bring a Mummified Troll Carcass to Mack Fearsen and place it in the fire. ,"Ugh. Wrappin' up these unfortunate trolls be makin' my heart ache, but not so much as my back! Help ol' Prigmon out and haul one of these carcasses over to Mack. If we don't burn 'em they be walkin' again in no time. "
238,Riding the Red Rocket,General Gorlok at the lighthouse in Venture Bay wants you to destroy the Alliance Lumber Boat. ,"You there, <race>! Get your lousy carcass over here! The Alliance have a shipment of lumber all ready for transport just northeast of here. Since getting our hands on that wood is out of the question, there's only one thing to do - destroy it! The goblin at the end of the dock here has some torpedoes all ready to go. He's got all the fuel for them on the docked goblin ship to the north. Get some fuel, then commandeer one of the torpedoes and ride it into their ship. Dismissed! "
239,Vial of Visions,"Drakuru at Granite Springs wants you to bring him an Imbued Vial, a Waterweed Frond, and 3 Haze Leaves. ","First things first, mon. There be some preparatory work that need doin'. No tellin' how long dey gunna keep me here. Ya be needin' a powerful elixir so we can be keepin' in touch. Lucky for you, I know just the thing! And the ingredients all be close by. I need a vial from the pretty little troll over there, some waterweed from the lake just north of here, and a few haze leaves found around the camp here.

We have to get to Amberpine Lodge immediately!  Once Lieutenant Dumont finds out who these people really are, this town will be reduced to rubble! "
241,Attack on Silverbrook,Conqueror Krenna at Conquest Hold wants you to slay 8 Silverbrook Defenders in the Silverbrook Hills. ,"A few hours ago, the trappers were nothing but peasants threatening to add their number to the Alliance's. Now they've become something else. . . an uncertainty.  I do not like uncertainties.  Go to the hills outside their main town in northern Grizzly Hills, Silverbrook, and help my men crush them. "
242,Mounting Up,Ride 5 Highland Mustangs back to Squire Percy at the Westfall Brigade Encampment. ,"Cap'n Stoutmantle left most of our calvary. . . cavlary. . . uh, horsemen at the fight for Venture Bay. We chose a good place to put the camp 'cause there are tons of highland mustangs running around near here and in the Boulder Hills to the northeast. The Cap'n put me in charge of capturing some of 'em. Will you help? I've got a stick and some string, and there are loads of wild carrots growing near the camp. Pick the carrots and use them with the stick to lure in the mustang, then ride it back here. "
243,See You on the Other Side,Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to use the Drakil'jin Mallet on the gongs outside Drakil'jin Ruins. ,"These Drakkari have met you with nothing but savage hostility. You owe them nothing. Few indeed would carry out the task that Kraz asks of you today. To cleanse this place and send the spirits to their eternal rest, you must join them in death. There is one inside the crypt who awaits you - on the other side. He holds the knowledge we seek, <name>. Use the mallet on the gongs. The spirit of he who corrupts this place will surely deliver you to the spirit world. Kraz awaits your return. "
244,Find Kurun! ,Speak with Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan. ,"The Earthen warrior's stone surface is covered with cracks and gouges. Although it is incapable of bleeding, you can sense that the warrior is near death. A low, hoarse voice escapes from the dying warrior's mouth. ""Find. . . Kurun. . . you must find. . . Kurun. ""It looks at you helplessly as you ask for any clues as to who or what Kurun might be. ""Our. . . leader. . . he stands on the. . . hill overlooking Thor Modan. . . commands us. Please. . . tell him. . . we cannot take. . . the city. . . """
245,Good Troll Hunting,Sergeant Thurkin told you to speak to Samir at Granite Springs. ,"Good for nothing wretches! They could have had it easy. We extended our hand in peace. All they had to do was give us passage through Drak'Tharon and we'd have let them be. But no, the prideful little ice trolls decided that they wanted it rough. Now they'll be destroyed and we'll pass through their precious keep to Zul'Drak anyway. We've contracted a gang to deliver us captured trolls. Talk to Samir if you want in on the action. You can find him to the northwest of here, due south of Zeb'Halek. "
246,Delivery to Krenna,Take the Bundle of Hides to Krenna in Conquest Hold. ,"This is it, mon.  Let's take these hides to Krenna and see if they pass the test. Let's hope for both our sakes Krenna doesn't notice anything. "
247,Anatoly Will Talk,Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post wants you to take the Tranquilizer Dart and use it on Tatjana in Solstice Village. ,"My sister is here somewhere, and I can't seem to get this monster to talk. He doesn't seem to care about his own well-being, but I've an idea.  I knew Anatoly's wife, Tatjana, from before the wolfcult arrived -- she was a horse-handler. Take this tranquillizer dart.  Bring her back alive, we're going to need her if we're to have any leverage with Anatoly. I will help you find the person behind all this once we save my sister. "
248,The Conquest Pit: Mad Furbolg Fighting,Defeat Torgg Thundertotem inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward. ,"You're not bad.  Not bad at all. Think you can take a furbolg?  What about one of those extra-large crazed Northrend furbolgs? Good, good.  Get your crew together, and head to the ring.  Let's give these folks a show. . . maybe we can earn some more coin while we're at it. "
249,Raining Down Destruction,Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to disrupt the iron dwarves' work by throwing boulders into the exposed area of Thor Modan. ,"Beneath us is iron's ancient bastion, Thor Modan. Thousands of years ago, the stone giants tore the land asunder, collapsing part of the city and exposing much of the rest. Even now, the iron dwarves attempt to reclaim their old capital, but we will not permit it. My giants fill the trench with boulders and debris, hoping to seal it off and kill the servants of iron as they work. Take up the boulders you see near the trench to the northeast, and help us put an end to their efforts. "
250,The Captive Prospectors,"Free Prospector Gann, Prospector Torgan, and Prospector Varana, then return to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point. ","Raegar sent a team of prospectors into Dun Argol to search for artifacts and information about the history of the settlement. Raegar's team never expected Dun Argol to be this heavily populated. They're being held captive while the iron dwarves prepare for war. We haven't the men to charge in after them, and Raegar's too busy fantasizing about defeating the irons to be of much help. It falls to you, <name>. Any of the irons or their servants could be carrying the keys to the cages holding our men. "
251,Into the Breach,Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to kill Iron Thane Argrum. ,"If we can't overcome the defenders inside Thor Modan, the iron dwarves can hold out forever. The Earthen are bravely taking on the constructs built by the sons of iron, but they cannot break into the city. The tunnels narrow too quickly for my fellow giants to be of use, so our options are few. Would you be willing to venture into the city and kill the dwarf commanding the resistance? "
252,Steady as a Rock? ,"Retreive the Portable Seismograph and use it to take stability readings in Thor Modan, then return to Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment. ","Orlond's notes indicate that he brought a piece of equipment called a portable seismograph with him, but the device is nowhere to be seen. The survey log shows that Orlond completed all his readings in the Thor Modan tunnel, save one labeled the 'east end of the exposed tunnel. 'The last entry in the log indicates Orlond tried to take refuge in the water and was attacked by subterranean threshers. They might've taken his equipment. You'll need to recover it before you can take the last reading. "
253,The Damaged Journal,"Recover 8 Missing Journal Pages, combine them with the Incomplete Journal, and return the completed journal to Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah. ","This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps in the dwarven language. The only text you're able to decipher is the name of Brann Bronzebeard scrawled at the end of one of the entries. The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Someone thought the notes important enough to attempt to destroy them. Perhaps gathering the missing pages from the battlefield will yield some clues. "
254,Heart of the Ancients,Drakuru wants you to go to the uppermost chamber at Blue Sky Logging Ground and find the Heart of the Ancients. ,"Secrets of da ages, be revealed to me now! <Drakuru peers through the Eye of the Prophets. >Ahh, great be mah destiny, <name>. You be lucky ta know me. . . . There! I be seein' it, mon. The Heart of the Ancients. Dis be too easy! You gunna find da heart lyin' near da corpse of a goblin east of here. He be up in a chamber, near a river of broken trees. Hurry, mon, before someone else be findin' it! "
255,Troll Season! ,Lieutenant Dumont at Amberpine Lodge wants you to speak to Samir at Granite Springs. ,"You, <race>! No sense standing around here when there's work to be done! Drak'Theron Keep is the most direct route to Zul'Drak. We MUST capture it to ensure safe passage for the Alliance. But until we get the numbers to make an assault, we'll have to content ourselves in thinning out the ice trolls and collecting intel. To that end, we've conscripted a gang of thugs to capture and deliver live trolls for interrogation. Travel northwest and speak with Samir at Granite Springs. He'll direct you further. "
256,A Show of Strength,Kill 12 Dragonflayer Huscarls and return to Sergeant Nazgrim at Conquest Hold. ,"Preparations for war are underway in the vrykul village of Voldrune to the southeast. Voldrune's thane cannot field a large army, but with our forces spread thin, we are still at risk. We cannot risk giving the thane and his men an opportunity to attack, so we must take the battle to them. If you are truly a <class> of the Horde, you will relish the chance to demonstrate our strength. Cut down the huscarls and prove to this Dragonflayer clan that the Horde is not to be trifled with! "
257,Ruuna the Blind,Speak to Ruuna the Blind at Ruuna's Camp near Vordrassil Pass. ,"Hey there.  I overheard what you were saying to the captain and I just want you to know. . .  things aren't that simple in Northrend. Just because someone's dead it doesn't mean they're out of the picture. Southwest of here, near Vordrassil Pass, lives a blind woman who goes by the name Ruuna the Blind.  They say she speaks to the dead and has visions of the past and future. I haven't heard your whole story but it sounds like she'd be right up your alley. "
258,Mikhail's Journal,Bring Mikhail's Journal to Conqueror Krenna in Conquest Hold. ,"From what you can gather, this journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail. It is written in some variant of the common human tongue.  Perhaps you should bring this back to Conqueror Krenna. "
259,Mmm. . . Amberseeds! ,Speak with Master Woodsman Anderhol in Amberpine Lodge. ,"Your stomach growls as the pungent smell of hearty nuts draws your attention to the the bucket of seeds. Some thoughtful soul has obviously left these complimentary morsels here to rejuvenate weary visitors. Grateful, you take the remaining few and devour them. The seeds do not disappoint. Finding yourself hungry for more, you set out to discover their origins. . . . "
260,The Conquest Pit: Death Is Likely,Defeat Horgrenn Hellcleave inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward. ,"I'm gonna shoot straight with ya, kid.  This next contender's a murderer. Literally. He was to be executed last week, but he strangled the hangman with his left hand, so Krenna's guards sort of let me have him. Feel free to pass on this one.  I wouldn't blame ya. "
261,Destroy the Sapling,Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to take the Verdant Torch and use it to burn Vordrassil's Sapling. ,"The furbolgs' work must be undone, <name>.  The best of intentions do not count for much when the result is tainted by such strong a corruption. The sapling must be destroyed, for it is the source of this dark influence.  Take this torch and use it to set fire to the corrupted sapling and bring me its ashes. Once cleansed, by fire, I will use what power I can to remove the taint from them.  You will need the ashes to purify Ursoc from the evil power that holds sway over him. "
262,The Darkness Beneath,"Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to go to Vordrassil's Heart, Vordrassil's Tears and Vordrassil's Limb and use the Geomancer's Orb in the depths beneath the surface. ","Something. . . dark. . . happened to the tree Vordrassil.  After the druids decided to destroy it, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground. I want you to go to the three locations to the northeast where the tree's trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can. Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area.  This might shed some light on what happened to Vordrassil and why it failed to become a world tree. "
263,The Conquest Pit: Blood and Metal,Defeat Rustblood inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward. ,"It's nice to have a real fighter around these parts. . . we'd only had prisoners and caged beasts for the past few weeks.  The people get bored, ya know? Anyhow, your next challenge is a genuine iron golem stolen from the depths of Thor Modan. . . think you can swing it? "
264,Rallying the Troops,"Use the Shard of the Earth to rally the Grizzly Hills Giants fighting in the Boulder Hills, kill any iron dwarves who oppose you, then report to Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan. ","The sons of iron have used their runes to enthrall many of my brothers and are using them to break the siege on Thor Modan. I wish we did not have to fight them, but we have no choice. My giants will not hold out long against them. I have imbued this earthen shard with a blessing that will aid our allies. Take it with you to the battle in the Boulder Hills to the north, and use it to reassure and fortify my brethren. Kill any iron dwarves who would stand in your way. "
265,Ruuna's Request,Ruuna the Blind wants you to obtain 4 handfuls of Gossamer Dust. ,"I will not charge you gold for my services, for I can foresee that your actions are necessary and much hinges on what you learn today. I will, however, ask you to collect a reagent for me.  Obtain gossamer dust from the fern feeder moths northeast of here.  Do this and I will prepare a potion that will take you to the time and place where the events took place that you need to witness. "
266,Gray Worg Hides,Hidetrader Jun'ik in Conquest Hold wants you to get 3 Gray Worg Hides from Graymist Hunters in the woods to the north. ,"Let me tell you something, mon.  When you get put in charge of outfittin' the armies of the Horde, you go through a lot of hides! Conqueror Krenna, the she-wolf runnin' this place, she gave me a tight deadline.  If I don't outfit her whole regiment by week's end she's gonna have me wrestling bears in the pit. Help me out and I'll pay you top price.  I'll be needin' hides from graymist hunters. You'll find them all around in pockets to the north, hunting stag.  Remember, mon.  Top price! "
267,The Iron Thane and His Anvil,"Using the abilities of your War Golem, defeat Iron Thane Furyhammer, then return to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point. ","Now that you've charged up your war golem, we're going to put all that energy to good use. Activate the golem inside Dun Argol to take control of it. Our  information about Dun Argol's leader, Iron Thane Furyhammer, suggests his bodyguard protects him from all harm. That bodyguard is the construct he travels with, called The Anvil. Disable the construct, and his protection will disappear. The thane stays in the building at the top of Dun Argol and supervises production from the bottom level. "
268,The Perfect Plan,Bring the completed War Golem Blueprint to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point. ,"The iron dwarves are making no secret of the fact that they're preparing for war. With their giants, golems, and lightning elementals, they'd have a technological advantage against the Westfall Brigade. If they don't find passage north in time, the irons could take them by surprise. We've got to tie them up here, and I've got just the way to do it. Dun Argol is full of rune-smiths churning out war golems. They carry plans for specific pieces, so you'll need to find and assemble all the parts. "
269,"To Conquest Hold, But Be Careful! ",Present yourself to Conqueror Krenna at Conquest Hold in the Grizzly Hills. ,I've received a request for help from our base in the Grizzly Hills. I'm sending you to see Conqueror Krenna. <The high executor waves a sheaf of parchment in the air as if he could care less what is written on it. >She's attempting to secure all of the natural resources or somesuch. Just watch your back around her. The word is that she's aggressive even for an orc. Follow the road east and then southeast. Cross the bridge at the Dragonspine Tributary and go east from the Evergreen Trading Post. 
270,Doing Your Duty,Anderhol in Amberpine Lodge wants you to take the Anderhol's Slider Cider and use the nearby outhouse to retrieve the Partially Processed Amberseeds. ,"Alright, <race>. Here's the juice. It works immediately, so don't use it until you're safely inside the outhouse. Now go get me those seeds! "
271,Test of Mettle,Find Sergeant Bonesnap northwest of Silverbrook and pass the Test of Mettle. ,"Alright, friend.  You've done us a favor or two, but that's not the true test of a person's courage. Around these parts, you're not a real hunter unless you wear your prey's skin. < Sergei unsheathes his skinning knife and hands it to you. >The leader of those motherless orcs attacking our town is called Bonesnap; you'll find him at a camp further northwest. That's right.  You're going to skin the monster. "
272,Replenishing the Storehouse,Master Woodsman Anderhol at Amberpine Lodge wants you to kill Tallhorn Stag and collect 8 Succulent Venison. ,"G'day, <class>. The good lieutenant here says that there's been a Horde raid on our storehouse that's left our food supply dangerously low. No doubt we'll make those cretins pay, but first we need to focus our attention on restocking. My men are doing all they can, but we're going to need every able body to contribute if we're to avert a crisis. You should have no trouble harvesting venison from the local stag in these parts. Happy hunting! "
273,. . . Or Maybe We Don't,Charge your War Golem with the energy from 10 Lightning Sentries and return to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point. ,"You'd think the guys making the power cells would've thought to power them up, but no, they've got to make it difficult for us. Fine, we'll charge those cells the hard way. There's enough power in them to run the golem for a short time, but don't expect it to be any good in combat. You see the lightning sentries that the irons have posted around the perimeter of Dun Argol? Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, and use the golem to absorb the power as the sentries die. "
274,Blackriver Brawl,Raider Captain Kronn wants you to slay 10 Alliance units or players at the Blackriver Logging Camp. ,"The Venture Company abandoned operations shortly after we showed up.  Clearly they were afraid of what we were going to do to their greedy little hides. With them gone, their logging camps are up for grabs.  Our war machine is a hungry beast. . . without renewing our supplies we won't make it to Icecrown. Unfortunately the Alliance seems to have the same idea and we must make sure we're the ones that prevail.  Head into the logging camp and help us fight the Alliance scum. "
275,The Runic Prophecies,Torthen Deepdig at the Westfall Brigade Encampment wants you to decipher the three Rune Plates. ,"We've no time to lose! Now that we've reassembled the runic keystone -- well, most of it -- we can decipher the contents of those very same runic plates Brann was working on before he fled. We have no way of knowing if he managed to read the contents of all three plates, but we'll have to assume he got enough information to determine his next destination. Stand before each of the plates and use the keystone to determine the contents of each. Brann may be counting on us! "
276,Runes of Compulsion,"Gavrock, at the Ruins of Tethys, wants you to neutralize the four Runes of Compulsion by defeating Overseer Durval, Overseer Korgan, Overseer Lochli, and Overseer Brunon. ","Even as Kurun attacks Thor Modan, the iron dwarves work their magics against our brothers. Summoning our brothers from the earth, then binding them with runes, the sons of iron force them to war against the children of stone. Along the Eastwind Shore, they use runes of compulsion to send enslaved giants to the battlefields of the north. Find the four runes of compulsion and force their overseers to appear by defeating the rune-weavers who man each rune. Without the overseers, the runes are useless. "
277,Shredder Repair,Synipus at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to bring 3 Broken-down Shredders back to him. ,"Listen, pal. Why don't ya roll up your sleeves and grab a wrench? There's work to be done! They need these shredders refurbished and sent down to Venture Bay, and they need it done yesterday. . . . No wrench? Well what good are ya then? May as well go down with the rest of the lugheads and play with the Horde! While you're there, see if you can drive some of those broken-down shredders up here for repairs. Be careful! They're in pretty bad shape. "
278,An Intriguing Plan,Bring the completed War Golem Blueprints to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah. ,"Prospector Rokar has decided to help us. He's concocted a plan to use the iron dwarves' strength against them. I must admit, our new 'friend' is more insightful than I'd given him credit for. He's correct in that our numbers are too few for a direct attack. Travel to Dun Argol, in the snowy regions to the southeast, and capture all the parts of their war golem blueprints from the iron rune-smiths there. Bring the assembled blueprint to Rokar and we'll see if his plan has any merit. "
279,Blackriver Skirmish,Scout Captain Carter wants you to kill 10 Horde units or players in the Blackriver Logging Camp. ,"The Venture Company's on its way out of Grizzly Hills.  They used to run logging operations here, but things got a little too dangerous for them. Their abandoned sites are up for grabs and we sure as hell can't let the Horde get their hands on them. The Blackriver Logging Camp is the smallest of the three logging sites in this zone, but we still need it.  Do your part and fend off the Horde forces.  Any lumber they get here will be made into weapons to be used against us elsewhere. "
280,Fate and Coincidence,Speak to Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post. ,"There are two types of people in this world, <name>.  Those who believe in coincidence and those who don't. On the day I lost my eyesight I was given the gift of clairvoyance.  I suppose you can guess what sort of person I am. Earlier today, a young woman named Sasha was granted the same vision you were.  You will want to talk to her. You'll find her directly east of here at the White Pine Trading Post, on the way to Solstice Village. "
281,Jun'ik's Coverup,Bring 1 piece of Coal and 5 Simple Flour to Hidetrader Jun'ik at Conquest Hold in Grizzly Hills. ,"Ah, we have a small problem.  Grizzly hides. . . they be brown, mon! Think. . . think! I got it, mon!  Is like this: gray is black an' white all mixed up.  You get me some coal an' some flour, I'll grind it all up and dust the hides with it.  No one will know the better! Blacksmiths sell coal for smeltin' an' you can get flour from the provisioner. "
282,A Sister's Pledge,Look for Anya in the Duskhowl Den near Solstice Village. ,"Please, <name>.  I know it is Arugal you're after.  I swear on my father's memory I will help you take him down. But I must beg you. . . Anya is completely innocent, we cannot leave her with these savages. Help me rescue my sister and you'll have me at your side when you face Arugal. I know the den Anatoly spoke of.  We'll find it on the other side of this hill.  Let's go, my sister's in danger. "
283,Softening the Blow,Bring Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment a cask of Howlin' Good Moonshine. ,"Our best bet for moving our forces quickly to Icecrown Glacier lies with the network of tunnels beneath the ancient iron dwarf city of Thor Modan. Brugar Stoneshear and his Explorers' League boys aren't going to be happy, but orders are orders. The news might go over better if you brought him a cask of that moonshine sold by that trapper, Hugh Glass, down at Redwood Trading Post, southeast of here along the tree line. Man's not right in the head, but you won't find better moonshine out here. "
284,Deciphering the Journal,Bring a sprig of Spiritsbreath to Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah. ,"Vor'takh is right -- we cannot allow this opportunity to slip through our fingers. Fortunately, I think I know of a way to translate the journal of this Brann. The shamans of the Redfang furbolgs, who congregate at the Heart's Blood Shrine south of the camp, grow an herb known as spiritsbreath. An experienced mystic can use incense made from it to seek wisdom from the spirits of the ancestors. Seek out the shaman known as Grumbald One-Eye. He should carry the herb for his devotions to Ursoc. "
285,Out of Body Experience,Drink the Gossamer Potion near Ruuna's Crystal Ball and witness the Vision from the Past. ,"Ah, you seek a vision of the past.  You're a wise <race>. Every time someone drops by for a reading, they seem to always ask about the future.  When you get to be my age, you learn that scrying the past, more often than not, is more useful. Drink this potion and peer into my crystal ball.  Let us see what knowledge we can obtain. "
286,The Runic Prophecies,Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah wants you to decipher the three Rune Plates. ,"Brann's journal also contained a guide to iron dwarf symbols. I've inscribed these on a keystone which will help you to understand the words inscribed on the rune plates. From the journal entries, it seems Brann may be chasing after clues to the origins of his people. Keep your eyes open for any clues as to his destination. Return to Thor Modan, northeast of here, stand before each of the plates, and use the stone to determine the contents of each. We can't allow the Alliance to find him first. "
287,Wolfsbane Root,Katja in Silverbrook wants you to uproot 8 Wolfsbane Roots. ,"Have you heard of the wolfsbane plant?  It is a horrible weed. . . it destroys our farmable crops. We spent all of last week cutting them down, but the roots are beginning to sprout again. It might not seem like an urgent matter, but a resurgence of the plant could be a real. . . disaster.  Do you think you could help us by uprooting them where you find them near the village? "
288,A Dark Influence,"Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Vordrassil's Heart, Vordrassil's Tears and Vordrassil's Limb and use the Geomancer's Orb in the depths beneath the surface. ","When the tree Vordrassil fell, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground. I want you to go north of here to the three locations where the trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can.  You'll find them west of Grizzlemaw. Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area.  If we're to heal the land, we must first find out what caused Vordrassil to fail as a world tree all those years ago. "
289,It Takes Guts. . . . ,Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to enter Drakil'jin Ruins and collect 5 Drakkari Canopic Jars. ,"Greetings, <class>. It is kind of you to stop and listen to Kraz 's tale. For many years Kraz has strained to hear the spirits and do their bidding. Recently,  many voices have been crying to Kraz from these ruins. They seek for a peace they cannot find on their own. If you would help the spirits of those who have come before, enter this crypt and collect something that once belonged to those tormented souls. "
290,Drak'aguul's Mallet,Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to slay Drak'aguul outside Drakil'jin Ruins and return with the Drakil'jin Mallet. ,"Corruption. . . . Even before you delivered these jars, Kraz could sense it. This corruption fills the ancient Drakkari spirits with great angst and prevents them from entering the rest they seek. Kraz will not lie, <class>. Cleansing this place will require great sacrifice, but we shall speak of that at another time. There is one among the living here who holds the key to its cleansing. Seek out Drak'aguul and return to Kraz with the mallet he carries. "
291,The Runic Keystone,Bring 5 Runic Keystone Fragments to Torthen Deepdig at the Westfall Brigade Encampment. ,"Brann's journal mentions that he used a runic keystone to illuminate the important runes on the plate he discovered. Without the keystone, the plate's contents would be little better than gibberish. At the end of Brann's last entry, he describes the iron dwarf defenders seizing the keystone from him, shattering it, and dividing it among themselves. Before we can decipher the runed plate, we must hunt down the fragments. Any of the dwarves within Thor Modan or the buildings around it may carry fragments. "
292,Pieces Parts,"Pipthwack in Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to collect 4 Grooved Cogs, 3 Notched Sprockets, and 2 High Tension Springs. ","Ack! This thing's a mess! Goblin engineering leaves a great deal to be desired, believe you me. Just look at this! It's a wonder it ever worked to begin with. Give me a hand, will ya? To get this even close to operable specifications I'll need to replace a few cogs, sprockets, and springs. You should have no trouble finding them down around the sawmill. "
293,Eyes Above,Windseer Grayhorn wants you to use the Silver Feather on 6 Imperial Eagles in Grizzly Hills. ,I've been asked to lend my support to our efforts against the Alliance.  At the moment our military forces are about evenly matched and we're looking for ways to find an edge. The imperial eagles that fly over the mountains and trees in this area would make excellent scouts for us.  Take this silver feather and use it to bind my sight to that of them. Being able to see our enemy's movements will grant us the strategic advantage we need.  You'll find abundant eagles in the mountains to the east. 
294,Life or Death,Rheanna at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to use the Renewing Bandage on 10 Wounded Westfall Infantry units. ,"Oh, the carnage. . . . I've been through many battles, <class>, and this one was more brutal than any I've seen. Our fight with the Horde has become more intense than ever. It's them or us here in Northrend - life or death. If we are to survive here another day we'll need to mend our wounded. There are too many for me to rescue alone. I've prepared special bandages that will enable you to assist me. Take one and tend to those who have not yet succumbed to their wounds. "
295,Descent into Darkness,Bring Mikhail's Journal to Lieutenant Dumont in Amberpine Lodge. ,"The journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail.  It details the arrival of a shadow-worshipping group called the ""wolfcult. ""The villagers were reluctant to embrace the cult at first, but sympathizers sprung up gradually among town residents. Unsettled by this, Mikhail sent his daughter Sasha away from Silverbrook while he attempted to reason with the other villagers. Mikhail's last entry mentions a meeting of local town leaders to discuss unspecified events in Hollowstone Mine. "
296,Check Up on Raegar,Speak with Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point. ,"With all the excitement about the army trying to move through Thor Modan, I'd almost forgotten about Raegar's crew down at Prospector's Point. I sent Raegar and his assistants, along with a mountaineer friend, down to establish a small post near Dun Argol, at the southern end of the Eastwind Shore. They were to investigate the iron dwarf presence in the southern hills, but I haven't received any reports yet. Could you check up on them if you're going down that way? "
297,Looking the Part,Bring an Overseer's Uniform to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point. ,"If, as Prospector Varana said, only certain irons are permitted to communicate with this Loken, it'll probably be the overseers who have the privilege. We have to get you in there to see what all this is about, but it won't be easy. The first step will be to get a proper uniform for you. Then, we'll worry about doing your makeup. Find one of the overseers at Dun Argol, kill him, and bring back his uniform. If you get blood on it, you'll have only yourself to blame. "
298,Ruuna the Blind,Speak to Ruuna the Blind at Ruuna's Camp near Vordrassil Pass. ,"This trapper business has the potential to be more important than we've accounted for. If they're not with the Alliance, there's a good chance they're with the Scourge, which could mean trouble. Our previous efforts might've paid off, though.  We spotted our former captive meeting with a fortune teller of some sort before we lost track of her. I'm almost certain now that she will take us to their leader if we can find her again.  Find Ruuna the Blind and see what you can find out. "
299,Kick 'Em While They're Down,Sergeant Hartsman wants you to defeat 15 Horde units or players in Blue Sky Logging Grounds. ,"It is a dark day for the Alliance. Many good men lay dead or dying here. Our only consolation is that they fought well and brought down many of the enemy with them. With the bulk of our forces committed to Venture Bay we stand alone to weather this storm. The resources in this region are vital to the Alliance and may well make the difference in our struggle against the Horde. We must not fail! Go, <name>. Strike at them while they lick their wounds. Avenge your fallen brothers and keep our hopes alive! "
300,Shimmercap Stew,Prigmon in Granite Springs wants you to collect 5 Shimmering Snowcaps and 5 Ice Serpent Eyes from Drak'Zin Ruins and 5 Sweetroot from Zeb'Halak. ,"Say, while yer here, how bout ya help ol' Prigmon with a little chore? I got a friend who can make a mean stew - one like ya never tasted before! There be a few ingredients found in these parts that he be needin'. They be in ruins to the southwest and the camp just north o' here. Whatd'ya say, mon? "
301,The Conqueror's Task,Speak to Sergeant Nazgrim in Conquest Hold. ,"The Horde is a magnificent war machine and you are nothing but a cog. I am in charge of securing fuel for this machine.  If I fail, the machine fails. Lumber, ore, water. . . it's all here and we want it.  And so does the Alliance. Before we can move against the human scum, we need to solidify our control over the western region. Speak to Sergeant Nazgrim about eradicating the vrykul in Voldrune and then maybe - if you turn out to not be a complete failure - we'll send you on further tasks. "
302,Seeking Solvent,Gurtor at the Venture Bay Horde base wants you to bring him a canister of Element 115. ,"Gah! Not again. Another blown gasket. . . . Every time one of these goes, lubricant gums up all of the gears. Without solvent, it takes hours to clean. Tell ya what, <race>. There's some fancy rocket fuel on the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they call it. That stuff makes for a great solvent. Get me one of those and I'll make it worth your trouble. "
303,Bringing Down the Iron Thane,"Using the abilities of your War Golem, defeat Iron Thane Furyhammer, then return to Tormak the Scarred at Camp Oneqwah. ","Now that the golem is fully charged, it can be used against the leader at Dun Argol. When I observed Iron Thane Furyhammer, he was always guarded by a personal golem that shielded him from all harm. That construct called The Anvil, can be disrupted, causing him to drop the shield. Use your golem's EMP ability to do just that. You'll be able to activate and take control of your golem inside Dun Argol. The thane is in the main plant at the top and supervises production from the bottom level. "
304,Report to Gryan Stoutmantle. . . Again,Speak to Captain Gryan Stoutmantle at the Westfall Brigade Encampment. ,"The Westfall boys were sent east to look for a path into the northern territories.  Their secondary objective is to secure strategic resource points, so I'm sure they wouldn't mind investigating a mine. Look for the Westfall Brigade encampment far to the northeast and seek out Gryan Stoutmantle.  You might remember him if you ever spent any time in Westfall.  Make sure to tell him I sent you. He'll be more than happy to let you claim a functioning mine for the king. "
305,Blackout,"Use Raegar's Explosives to destroy the Runic Power Core at Dun Argol, then report to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point. ","The large hall at the top of Dun Argol houses the power source for the entire area. If you can destroy the power core, it will cripple Dun Argol for some time. No power means no golems, no sentries, and no more lightning armaments. When we were sent up here, they told us these explosives were for excavation, but thanks to Iron Thane Furyhammer, the research has been scrapped. We may as well get some use out of them, though. They're the only thing we have on hand capable of destroying the power core. "
306,The Failed World Tree,"Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Vordrassil's Limb, Vordrassil's Heart or Vordrassil's Tears and obtain 6 Slime Samples from the Entropic Oozes. ","My ancestors once planted a tree in the middle of the Grizzly Hills. It was called Vordrassil and it was to become a world tree. For reasons long forgotten, after the tree was fully grown, they decided it needed to be destroyed.  Its giant trunk splintered at three locations in the area to the north. Where the tree touched the ground, foul ooze began to crawl the earth.  Bring me slime samples so I can begin my work and the earth can be healed. "
307,Say Hello to My Little Friend,Prigmon wants you to bring Harkor's Ingredients to Harkor at Harkor's Camp. ,"Harkor 's gunna drop a gold brick when he sees these choice ingredients. All that be left is gettin' them to him. He's camped out on the eastern coast near dem haunted ruins - Drakil'jin, dey be called. You'll likely be makin' it there before I can finish up with these corpses. . . unless, ya think you'd rather try your hand at embalming? "
308,. . . Or Maybe We Don't,Charge your War Golem with the energy from 10 Lightning Sentries and return to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah. ,"The golem's cells have just enough power to run it at the lowest levels, but it can't power any of its combat systems. The good news is that the perimeter of Dun Argol is patrolled by lightning sentries. We should be able to use their power to charge up the golem's weapon systems. Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, it will absorb the power as the sentries die. "
309,Gorgonna,Bring Mikhail's Journal to Gorgonna in Conquest Hold. ,This book is written in the pig-tongue the humans use.  It needs to be burned immediately. Hand it to my sister Gorgonna and do not waste my time. 
310,Vordrassil's Seeds,Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to go to Grizzlemaw and obtain 8 of Vordrassil's Seeds. ,"We must make sure that Vordrassil is never regrown.  The furbolg must have harvested its seed. Go to Grizzlemaw, in central Grizzly Hills, and obtain all the seeds that you can find.  I will make sure they're properly destroyed. "
311,A Swift Response,Lieutenant Dumont wants you to go to Forest's Edge Post and slay Vladek and 7 Silverbrook Hunters. ,"Our response must be immediate.  Decisive.  We must teach these savages not to cross us. Our scouts have located what's left of the Silverbrook trappers. . . you know, the ones you didn't get to douse in flames.  Apparently they're blockading the road to the southeast. . . perhaps they're trying to box us in. Head to the Forest's Edge post and take care of them.  Their leader's reported to be a man named Vladek. . . make sure he's dealt with. "
312,Seeking Solvent,Barblefink at the Alliance base in Venture Bay wants you to bring him a canister of Element 115. ,"Gah! Not again. Another blown gasket. . . . Every time one of these goes, lubricant gums up all of the gears. Without solvent, it takes hours to clean. Tell ya what, <race>. There's some fancy rocket fuel on the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they call it. That stuff makes for a great solvent. Get me one of those and I'll make it worth your trouble. "
313,A Bear of an Appetite,Bring 6 Northern Salmon to Hugh Glass at the Redwood Trading Post. ,"Thank goodness you're back, Limpy! I worried that Griselda and I were going to be all alone. I'm cooking up some food here for us, but Griselda'll have none of it. She's fond of the fish that live off the coast of the Eastwind Shore, to the east. Can't stand them myself, but she's always been a picky eater. Six good-sized fish ought to keep her happy for a while. Now, run. . . err. . . limp along, Joe. Wouldn't want to keep the girl waiting, would ya? "
314,Seared Scourge,Mack at Granite Springs wants you to use his grog to burn 30 Famished Scourge Trolls. ,"Whatcha waitin' fer, <class>? Them shcourged trolls ain't gunna kill themselves! You know the drill. Git up ta Drak'Tharon up north. . . Take some o thish here grog and hurl it at 'em from a distance. . . <hic>.  Then jusht sit back an' watch 'em burn. "
315,Latent Power,"Charge the Shard of Gavrock at the First Ancient Stone, the Second Ancient Stone, and the Third Ancient Stone, then return to Gavrock at the Ruins of Tethys. ","While the runes of compulsion are dormant, there is a chance we can release the runed giants. I will give you a piece of stone that has been part of me since my creation. If properly imbued, it can be used to free the bound giants. Two ancient stone markers sit atop places of power between the Path of Iron and the forest's edge -- locations your people would call the intersections of ley lines. The other is on an island at the southern end of these ruins. Charge the shard at each stone and return. "
316,The Way to His Heart. . . ,Toss Tasty Reef Fish at a Reef Bull to lead it to a Reef Cow. ,"The Northsea Pirates slaughtered the isles' alpha sea lion bull, Big Roy. They made soap from him to clean the decks of their ships! < Anuniaq sighs. >Now the sea lions won't mate. Help me to repopulate their numbers. The reef bulls can be found at the Twin Shores to the southeast. They crave the tasty reef fish that can be found on the east and west sides of the isles. Take this net and gather enough fish, at least a dozen -- maybe more, to lure a bull across the strait to a reef cow. "
317,It Goes to 11. . . ,"Lieutenant Icehammer in the Howling Fjord wants you to destroy the Dragonflayer Longhouse, Dragonflayer Dockhouse, Dragonflayer Storage Facility and 8 Dragonflayer Defenders. ","We must strike while the vrykul forces are in disarray! Take the harpoon control mechanism to Nifflevar and locate the northernmost harpoon building on the bluff side of the village. Once there, commandeer one of the vrykul harpoon guns that are stationed on the building's deck. Use the harpoon gun to rain hell upon Wyrmskull Village! Destroy the longhouse, dockhouse, storage facility and any defenders that the vrykul may send at you! Do this and Daggercap Bay will become a much safer port! "
318,March of the Giants,Sage Edan and Camp Winterhoof wants you to use the Runeseeking Pick on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants. ,"To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed stone giants have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. I know nothing of their goals, nor of their destination. The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Fell some of these giants. Take this pick with you and use it on the corpses of the runed stone giants. It will deactivate the runes. Once you've tested enough giants, return to me with your findings. "
319,The Frozen Heart of Isuldof,Recover the Frozen Heart of Isuldof and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord. ,"Some say Jonah was never quite right in the head, but I know the truth. It was the heart. That damned frozen heart! I saw the change in him the second he pulled it from the grave. I could see the blood freeze in his veins. . . It was then that the madness truly took over. He left us to hole up in his cave on the north side of this island. Last I heard he had thrown the heart in the back of his bear den. Too little, too late. . . I'll kill you myself if you even think about bringing that heart back here! "
320,The Dead Rise! ,"Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift in the Howling Fjord wants you to find Fengir's Clue, Rodin's Clue, Isuldof's Clue and Windan's Clue. ","The path east of us is a primary hunting trail of the tuskarr. At least that's what it used to be. . . More recently our hunters have been returning to Kamagua claiming that the dead have risen and are out for blood! That is what has brought my son and me here. Elder Atuik asks that we find resolution in the bluffs. Will you assist us in our time of need? I seek heroes willing to brave the perils of Shield Hill, southeast of here. Search the desecrated graves for clues and return your findings to me. "
321,The Path to Payback,Guard Captain Zorek at Valgarde in Howling Fjord wants you to recover the Harpoon Operation Manual. ,"Two weeks ago our chief engineer got his hands on a vrykul harpoon gun - the same type of gun that the vrykul use to take down our ships. By studying that gun he managed to put together a comprehensive operation manual. Unfortunately he was abducted and taken north of here to Wyrmskull Village. We eventually did find him, but near death and without the manual. His dying words indicated that the manual was lost in the Utgarde Catacombs, located at the northwest end of Wyrmskull. Get me that manual! "
322,The Jig is Up,Annie Bonn at Scalawag Point wants you to bring her Jonah Sterling's Spyglass. ,"I know why you're here, <name>.  You've been sent to kill our leader, Jonah Sterling. I'd like to offer my help.  Jonah's leadership threatens our operation. Attacking the Horde and the Alliance fleets simultaneously?  Suicidal.  Trying to sell the tuskarr as slaves when they die days after leaving this climate?  Disastrous. Jonah's hideout is located inside a cave west of here.  Bring me his spyglass as proof of the deed  and my first action as lead will be to end all attacks against your allies. "
323,Send Them Packing,Explorer Abigail has asked you to /raise your hand at 10 Abandoned Pack Mules and then return to her at Westguard Keep. ,"I've heard rumors of bad happenings in the Whisper Gulch to the north. Most of the Explorers' League went down into that place, and some say they went mad with what they discovered. That doesn't change the fact that they took most of our mules and equipment with them, though. I won't lose those mules! If you find yourself in there, and happen across any of my mules, just get up close on them and threaten them with a raised hand. They'll spook and come home for sure. "
324,The Echo of Ymiron,Thoralius the Wise wants you to search Wyrmskull Village while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Wyrmskull. ,"The spirit world has fallen under the sway of the Lich King. Fearsome creatures made of pure nightmare now stand watch over the realm of the elements. I sense that these val'kyr are guarding a terrible secret. I am too old and weak to survive another journey. You must go in my place, <name>. Take this incense burner to Wyrmskull Village and use it to enter the spirit world. Find the large dwelling in the northeast! Avoid the val'kyr at all costs lest they make you a permanent fixture in their world. "
325,Seeds of the Blacksouled Keepers,Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to freeze 8 Spores. ,"The glade to the northwest, now the Twisted Glade, used to be home to a number of keepers of the glade. Together with the sisters, they saw to the glade's upkeep. When the glade changed, the sisters died, but somehow the keepers managed to survive. Now, they seed the land with poisonous spores that wither healthy greenery. I'll give you one of the cores from the ice elementals. Once you've destroyed a spore, use the ice crystal to freeze it and keep it from regenerating. "
326,The Lost Shield of the Aesirites,Speak with Captain Ellis aboard the Sister Mercy. ,"If you listen real close you can hear cannon fire coming from the northeast. That's Captain Ellis 's ship, Sister Mercy. Thing is, Ellis and his entire crew were killed 'bout a month ago. <Harry nods. >Ghost ship. . . If it's info you be wantin' 'bout the shield, Ellis is the man to ask. Sister Mercy docks on the small island between here and Sorlof's Strand to pick up more souls for the ship's crew 'bout once every five minutes. There be no shortage of souls 'round these parts. . . "
327,A Lesson in Fear,"Gorth wants you to kill Ulf the Bloodletter, Oric the Baleful and Gunnar Thorvardsson and drive the Forsaken Banner through their corpses. ","When you've been in lots of fight like Gorth, you learn that to beat enemy good you have to make them really scared to die! But these vrykuls not afraid.  You kill one and another comes. . . screaming louder and with a bigger weapon than the one before. Only thing that makes vrykuls afraid is when we kill the biggest and baddest vrykul of all. Go fight the Winterskorn across the blockade until hero vrykuls show up!  Then you kill them dead and put queen's flag on corpses.  They must learn to fear! "
328,Mutiny on the Mercy,Captain Ellis aboard the Sister Mercy in the Howling Fjord has asked that you recover 5 Barrels of Blasting Powder from the ship's hold. ,"Aye, we got problems, matey. Me gunners have mutinied! M'n'the crew up top be tryin' to kick Sorlof's keester while dealin' with the mutinous gunners down'blo. Ye're gonna have to go down'blo and deal with those mutinous sea dogs and take their blastin' powder for the big'un o'er on the poop deck. With ye mannin' the big'un, Sorlof is sure to die and give up the booty! "
329,"""Scoodles""","""Silvermoon"" Harry at Scalawag Point wants you to recover his Sin'dorei Scrying Crystal from the orca, ""Scoodles. ","One of the first things Jonah Sterling did after he went crazy was to take my prized sin'dorei scrying crystal and feed it to the bane of my existence, ""Scoodles"" the orca. No I didn't name the damned thing. I just know that she swims out past the ships directly southeast of Scalawag. Kill that overinflated goldfish and rip out my beautiful sin'dorei crystal from its stomach. Do this and we can get down to business. "
330,We Can Rebuild It,"Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Large Barrel, Industrial Strength Rope and Dark Iron Ingots. ","Tools? Check. Materials? Negative. If we're going to build this thing, you're going to have to get me the materials. First things first, <name>. For the skeletal structure I'm going to need a large barrel from Nifflevar, some dark iron ingots from Valgarde, and industrial strength rope from Baleheim. Nifflevar and Baleheim are vrykul towns northwest of here. Valgarde is located in Daggercap Bay, also to the northwest. Speak with McGoyver to get the ingots. He'll fly you back here once you're all done. "
331,The Frost Wyrm and its Master,Slay Wyrmcaller Vile and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay Glacion. ,"You were right to bring this to me, <name>. You must take help back north with you to Gjalerbron and slay that wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile! Even now, as we speak here, the frost wyrm may be on its way. However, if I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it! And <name>, please bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands. "
332,There Exists No Honor Among Birds,Hidalgo at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use your Trained Rock Falcon to capture 8 Fjord Hawk Eggs. ,"You are most definitely ready for the next step in falconry, <name>. Take your trained falcon east of here, to the vrykul hawk roost near the Stonewall Lift. From the roost you will send out your falcon to steal the eggs of the hawks. Their nests will be located in remote areas of the cliff walls surrounding the roost. Locate those nests and use your falcon to scavenge for the eggs! Beware the fjord hawk matriarchs, <name>. Should you come under attack, use your falcon's escape and soar abilities to flee! "
333,Swabbin' Soap,Scuttle Frostprow wants you to obtain Big Roy's Blubber as the main ingredient for her magic swabbin' soap. ,"Yeah, I got to get the deck swabbed spotless afore Mad Jonah comes 'round. An' I ain't gonna do it on my hands and knees neither! Problem is, we're all outa soap. That's more your problem than mine though, mate. Being the newbie 'round here, I gots a special trip for ya to make. Up on the northwest coast of this island, there's a whole mess o' sea lions. Amongst the nearby ice floes you'll find the alpha bull, Big Roy. Bring me back his blubber and I'll magic-up the best soap ya ever seen! "
334,Sorlof's Booty,Slay Sorlof using the Big Gun and recover Sorlof's Booty. ,"Me crew is gonna get the big'un all primed an'ready for ya, matey. She's restin' snuggly on the bow, o'er on the other side of the ship. Go'n man it and be ready to fire when Sorlof is in our sights! Once we take that landlubber down, ye'll have to recover the booty for us, seein' as how we can't leave the damned ship! Bring that booty back to me and ye'll get your cut - the shield. . . "
335,The Fallen Sisters,Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to use her pendant on 7 Chill Nymphs. ,"To the southwest was a glade that used to look much like this one. Mysterious forces and alien magics are reshaping the land. The glade has thawed, the sisters living there driven mad by the sudden change. We thought to reach out to them, but they attacked us. I fear many may be beyond saving, but I cannot give up hope. Take my pendant, travel southwest to the Vibrant Glade, and use it to try to free my sisters. "
336,Orfus of Kamagua,Find Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift in Howling Fjord. ,"Hail, traveler. I am Lunk-tusk of the Kalu'ak. We are known as tuskarr to your people. My partner and I were recently sent up to investigate strange happenings along one of our hunting trails. It was when we approached the graveyard known as Shield Hill that we were attacked by the undead. I was lucky to make it to this camp, but I am uncertain as to what became of Orfus. We parted ways at the Ancient Lift, southeast of here along the cliff edge. Will you go see if he is ok? "
337,Alpha Worg,Ulfang has asked you to slay Garwal. ,"When you've eaten Talonshrike's eyes, you should be able see Garwal and rip out his throat! <race>-thing, seek out and slay Garwal in the western Rivenwood. After you have killed him, go and tell Mistwalker that I am once more the alpha worg! "
338,Report to Anselm,Report back to High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord. ,"Let's send word back to old Anselm then.  Victory has come later than expected, but better late than never.  Tell him it will take our forces a few hours at most to finish off the stragglers here. Glory to the Banshee Queen! "
339,Alpha Worg,Ulfang has asked you to slay Garwal. ,"When you've eaten Talonshrike's eyes, you should be able see Garwal and rip out his throat! <race>-thing, seek out and slay Garwal in the western Rivenwood. After you have killed him, go and tell Moonleaf that I am once more the alpha worg! "
340,The Shining Light,Ares the Oathbound in the Utgarde Catacombs wants you to recover the Sacred Artifact. ,"<Ares gasps for air as he tries to speak. >I am an envoy of the Argent Crusade, charged with a sacred duty. Our forces were decimated in the Plaguelands. By the light of dawn, the artifact was cleansed and made pure once more. So many perished in the wake of its redemption. There is still a chance. . . still time. The artifact was hurled into the den of the fallen, far below us. Guarded by the unmerciful dead. <Ares' body glows with blinding light. >Light. Will. Protect. You. "
341,Demolishing Megalith,Defeat Megalith and return to Researcher Aderan at Fort Wildervar. ,"Binder Murdis created Megalith to be the most powerful of the runed giants and to lead them in their mission. Defeating Megalith will leave them lost and without direction. After the expeditionary force arrives, our soldiers will be able to isolate and defeat the remaining giants and oust their Iron Dwarf masters from their camps. Search the foothills of Frostblade Peak, north of Giants' Run for Megalith and defeat him! "
342,The Slumbering King,Defeat Queen Angerboda and stop the ritual to awaken King Ymiron. ,"A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the overlord. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below. However, it appears that the queen of the vrykul, Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the Winter's Terrace, on the north end of Gjalerbron. If you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late. "
343,And Then There Were Two. . . ,Search the Utgarde Catacombs for Glorenfeld. ,"There's no sign of the cipher on Zedd. After carefully searching the area you discover some writing in the dirt: ""Glor and Dae inside catacombs. Have cipher and tablets. ""Perhaps you should head into the catacombs located just north of here and search for Glorenfeld and Daegarn. The bridge crossing the worg pit will lead you right to the tunnel leading down into the catacombs. "
344,The Staff of Storm's Fury,Recover the Staff of Storm's Fury and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord. ,"Those artifacts are cursed and you'd be crazy to go looking for them, <race>. I know for certain that anyone that's come into direct contact with any of those items has either gone mad or been killed. Take that staff, for example. Last I heard the ship that held it was abandoned and left to rot on the coast of the Isle of Spears, north of here. If you want that thing, check the ship's hold. Whatever you do, don't bring that staff back here! And steer clear of Abdul! He'll tear your heart out. "
345,The Delicate Sound of Thunder,Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct to explore the thundering cave at Baelgun's Excavation Site. ,"The cavern that we opened at Baelgun's was the one place that most steered clear of. . . Can't say I blame 'em. The sound of thunder shot out of that cave, <name>! Loud, booming thunder! I think near the end, it was abandoned by all. Bad, bad things happened to any that went in to explore - most never coming back. I want you to check that cave out while you're at Baelgun's. Explore around the titan statue inside and report back with your findings. "
346,Return to Atuik,Deliver the bad news to Elder Atuik at Kamagua. ,Return to Elder Atuik at Kamagua. He and the rest of my people must be warned of this impending doom that approaches from the sea. <Orfus shivers. >Use the Ancient Lift to reach him. Please hurry! 
347,The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir,Recover the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord. ,"I was on the vessel that was bringing in the armor. We'd just boarded the ship and were headin' back here when we were attacked by a Forsaken destroyer. They boarded our ship, took all the booty for themselves, and then sunk her. That was the last I'd seen of that armor. If you want, you can take my bomber from Scalawag to the dreaded isle that the destroyer be docked. Talk to my woman, Alanya, outside. She'll get you on the bomber. If you manage to find the stuff, don't you dare bring it back! "
348,The Rune of Command,Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis. ,"Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation. Take it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered. The giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run. "
349,Forgotten Treasure,Handsome Terry at Scalawag Point wants you to bring him 1 Amani Vase and 1 Eagle Figurine from the shipwreck to the south. ,"I've made my fortune by specializing in treasure that regular pirates don't appreciate: art, antiquities, collector's pieces. Black Conrad's fleet sank south of here years ago.  All the gold and jewelry was picked clean by divers, but two ancient relics remain there.  One is a museum-quality Amani vase, the other is an eagle figurine. Go and retrieve them for me and I'll vouch for you with the other pirates.  I'll even throw in something to make your underwater adventure a bit more manageable. "
350,Let's Go Surfing Now,Use the large Vrykul Harpoon Gun in Nifflevar to launch yourself into Valgarde. ,"Navigating the steep bluffs of Howling Fjord can be nerve-racking! I've come up with a solution to ease that burden by utilizing vrykul technology and dwarven ingenuity. With just a few adjustments and some fine tuning I've created Icehammer's harpoon controller! Of course it hasn't been tested, but that's what you're here for! Take the controller to the big gun in Nifflevar and use it to launch yourself into Valgarde. Report your victory to Zorek. Oh yea, you can keep the controller. "
351,Apply Heat and Stir,"Fill the Empty Apothecary's Flask at the Cauldron of Vrykul Blood, then mix the Flask of Vrykul Blood with Harris's Plague Samples nearby until you've obtained a Balanced Concoction. ","You've done well so far, <name>.  I'd like to teach you some of my more advanced techniques, so that you gain a better understanding of the plague. Take this empty flask and fill it with blood from the cauldron to my left.  Mix it with the plague samples to my right until you obtain a well balanced mix. "
352,"Street ""Cred""","Speak with ""Silvermoon"" Harry at Scalawag Point about the missing Vrykul artifacts. ","The Northsea Freebooters all fear and respect Grezzix. I'm thinking they recognize my special talents and envy my amazing ship. All you need to do is tag along with my cabin boy, Lou, and you'll be in like. . . In like tin. Pirates love tin. Just talk to Lou when you're ready to go and he'll take you to Scalawag. Oh yea, you'll want to talk to ""Silvermoon"" Harry first. He'll have more information on the stuff they pilfered. Just watch what you say around him. He's a freak. . . crazy for blood elves. "
353,We Call Him Steelfeather,Locate Steelfeather circling Fort Wildervar and use the Feathered Charm to discover his secret. ,"We see one brave hippogryph circling over the fort, then swooping down and taking prey. Jethan over there has taken a couple of shots at the creature, but his arrows bounced right off! We've taken to calling this remarkable creature Steelfeather, but we can't see why he prefers the area around Fort Wildervar. Most hippogryphs are wary of people. Researcher Aderan has helped us fashion a charm from one of the creature's feathers. He claims it will allow the user to see through Steelfeather's eyes. "
354,Dragonflayer Battle Plans,Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port in the Howling Fjord has asked that you bring him the Dragonflayer Battle Plans. ,"While we were able to gather very little information as to the whereabouts of Ingvar, we do know that Yanis resides in a cave next to the worg pit inside Wyrmskull Village. Intelligence gathered from the rescued soldiers indicates that Yanis guards Dragonflayer battle plans. I need you to go back to Wyrmskull and recover those plans. Kill any vrykul that get in your way - including Yanis! "
355,A Return to Resting,"Use the Bundle of Vrykul Artifacts at the ransacked burial mounds of Shield Hill to return the Frozen Heart of Isuldof, the Shield of the Aesirites, the Staff of Storm's Fury and the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir. ","<Orfus hands you a satchel. >Within this satchel are the artifacts that you recovered. Locate the burial mounds of Shield Hill, far to the southeast, where the items were originally stolen from and return the artifacts. It is my hope that this gesture will quell the spirits that now haunt our hunting grounds. Be strong, <name>. . . "
356,The Lodestone,Sage Edan at Camp Winterhoof wants you to compare the Rune Sample with the Broken Tablet. ,"We must find what's luring the giants northwest, so we can stop them before they reach their destination. While the rune samples gave us some clues, the unknown runes worry me. When I visited Giants' Run, I noticed a large broken tablet jutting from the ground where the northeastern part of the area met the snow at the foot of Frostblade Peak. Take this sample, compare the runes with the tablet, and see what you can learn about the identity of this lodestone. "
357,The Cleansing,Sage Mistwalker at Steel Gate has advised you to cleanse yourself of Your Inner Turmoil through meditation at the Frostblade Shrine. ,"We braved the Rivenwood because of my troubled dreams concerning my worg life-friend, Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him. But, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way. First, you must cleanse your inner turmoil. There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, northeast of Camp Winterhoof. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain. Meditate there and then return to me. "
358,Skorn Must Fall! ,"Chieftain Ashtotem has asked you to use the Winterhoof Emblem at Skorn, and then to speak with the Winterhoof Brave. ","<name>, the vrykul fortress, Skorn, sits to the south. Its strange giants have recently awakened and have begun to spread, attacking us wherever they can. My scouts inform me that they are poised to strike at us here, but I do not have the strength to repel such a force. Instead, we will prepare to leave north to less dangerous lands. I ask that you use your cunning to buy us time. I've sent a brave ahead with the details. Show this emblem at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and do all he can to aid you. "
359,The Cleansing,Watcher Moonleaf at Steel Gate has advised you to cleanse yourself of Your Inner Turmoil through meditation at the Frostblade Shrine. ,"Of late I've had nightmares concerning a worg named Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him. However, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way. But first, you must cleanse your inner turmoil through meditation. There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, far to the northeast. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain. Meditate there to cleanse yourself and then return to me. "
360,Operation: Skornful Wrath,"Captain Adams has asked you to use the Westguard Command Insignia at Skorn, and then to speak with the Westguard Sergeant. ","<name>, I must now ask you to undertake an operation so hazardous, so deadly, that only you can see it through. The vrykul fortress, Skorn, sits on our eastern border. My scouts inform me that those 'giants' are poised to strike us, and with my forces scattered all over the fjord, I don't have the men to take the place by force. Instead, you're going to use your cunning. I've sent a sergeant ahead with the details. Show this command insignia at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and follow your orders. "
361,Sleeping Giants,Ahota Whitefrost has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul. ,"I've overheard what you've had to say with Greatmother Ankha. With all due respect, she's not having you go far enough. You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron! I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely. Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul. "
362,Adding Injury to Insult,"Read the Vrykul Insult to Bjorn Halgurdsson in Baleheim, then lead him back to Lydell's Ambush and help slay him. ","The vrykul are being clever about this.  Fortunately I've a trick up my sleeve. This leader of theirs, Bjorn, is a real hothead.  We've pieced together enough of their language to fashion what we think is a good insult.  Something involving his mother and large barnyard animals. . . we're not quite sure. Take this piece of paper and read it to him.  Once he starts chasing you, lure him back here.  We'll make sure he doesn't make it out alive. "
363,The New Plague,Apothecary Lysander at Vengeance Landing wants you to recover 10 Intact Plague Containers from the wrecked ship to the southeast. ,"Not long after Arthas condemned us to this wretched existence, we in the Royal Apothecary Society endeavored to create a plague of our own.  A plague that would devour all flesh: living, dead or undead. We've succeeded in creating this plague and we're here to hand deliver it to the Scourge's doorstep. The Alliance intercepted the ship carrying the latest strain engineered in our Undercity laboratories.  Head to the wreckage southeast of here and salvage whatever containers you can. "
364,Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jumping,Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Rocket Jump ability at Walt's Iron Rune Carving. ,"Alright, <name>; the time has come for you to climb inside this thing and learn how to use its basic abilities. When you're ready, get on the work bench and I'll get you situated inside the construct. Your first lesson is going to be using the construct's transportation system. You'll notice that the iron dwarves have set up special rune carvings around the dig site. Their constructs use those rune carvings to power up and fly from point to point. Try it with the rune carving I built here. "
365,Lightning Infused Relics,Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Collect Data ability to collect 15 sets of Iron Rune Data. ,"Your construct is ready to go. All abilities have been given a once over and I've programmed the machine to both comprehend and speak the language of the titans. Take the construct to Baelgun's Excavation Site, due south of here, and collect data from the lightning infused relics that litter the site. Remember to bluff any iron dwarves that suspect your construct to be a fake. And don't forget about rocket jumping from rune to rune to get around in there! Get on the table when you're ready! "
366,Trail of Fire,Escort Apothecary Hanes out of the Derelict Strand. ,"Thanks for bailing me out of this mess, <name>.  I was not looking forward to what these Alliance scumbags had in store for me. Let's get out of here and see if we can get back at them somehow.  Is that a campfire over there? "
367,Baleheim Must Burn! ,"Sergeant Gorth wants you to go to Baleheim and use Gorth's Torch to burn 1 Winterskorn Dwelling, 1 Winterskorn Watchtower, 1 Winterskorn Bridge and 1 Winterskorn Barracks. ","Killing the Winterskorns maybe not enough.  Maybe we burn their houses too!  Uh. . . and their bridges.  We should burn whole town to be safe! You take this torch.  Go to Baleheim, to the west, and burn EVERYTHING!  That teach them good. "
368,In Service to the Light,"Slay 10 Deathless Watchers, 4 Fearsome Horrors, and 2 Putrid Wights. ","Your service has been exemplary, <name>, but there is something that is troubling me: the Scourge. The Light cannot abide their presence, and neither shall we. I hope that it is not asking you too much, but I would have you return north to Gjalerbron and crush the unholy Scourge in that vile lair! Be sure to check for them in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron as well. Purification is the key to salvation, my child. Make us proud! "
369,Fresh Legs,Scout Valory wants you to investigate the sounds of battle coming from the northeast of Wyrmskull Village. ,"It's come at great cost, but we've completed our inspection of the site. The news isn't good. Nearly everyone has been slain or captured. Only a few veteran guards remain unaccounted for. The scouts have done all we can here. You must pick up where we've left off. Sounds of a skirmish are coming from up the hill to the northeast. Have a look, <class>. We can only hope there are some who have survived, and that they may have some intel we can use against this enemy. "
370,March of the Giants,Researcher Aderan at Fort Wildervar wants you to use the Runeseeking Pick on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants. ,"To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed stone giants have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. What their ultimate destination is, I do not know. The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Use this pick to deactivate the runes on the giants' corpses and return with your findings. "
371,The Yeti Next Door,Foreman Colbey at Fort Wildervar wants you to defeat Shatterhorn. ,"Maybe if the sentries won't help me, you will? I'm the foreman of the mine just across the bridge. My men are mining ore for the weapons our expeditionary force will need to carve a path into the Grizzly Hills. A giant yeti has invaded the mine, blocking the tunnel we need to expand! We've tried yelling at him and smoking him out, but nothing's worked. Maybe you could rouse it from its sleep with a meal of meat from the frosthorn rams in the snowy areas around town? Please? We're desperate! "
372,Give it a Name,Show the Blight Specimen to Tobias Sarkhoff at New Agamand. ,"My, my, how long has it been? How long have we been working on this damned plague? Finally, after an eternity of failure, we are blessed with perfection. This. . . It doesn't even have a proper name yet! This blight. . . That's it, BLIGHT! This blight will tear down the very fabric of life! <Harris hands you a vial. >Now, find the bat handler, Tobias, and show him the specimen. He'll get you on your way to Venomspite. "
373,Iron Rune Constructs and You: Collecting Data,Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Collect Data ability while standing near the Iron Dwarf Relic. ,"The most important part of your job while controlling the construct is the collection of data. I've placed an iron dwarf relic in the cart over yonder. It's the floating, lightning infused crystal. Get on the work bench and I'll put you back in the construct. Once you're back in the driver's seat, use the construct's data collection ability to pick up the test data. "
374,Gambling Debt,"Taruk at Scalawag Point wants you to collect ""Silvermoon"" Harry's Debt. ","I heard you did a little work for Terry.  I was hoping someone reliable would show up around these parts. See, pirates love to gamble.  They, however, do not love to pay their gambling debt. If you're interested in collecting some coin on my behalf, I'd be willing to give you a cut. Let's start you out with an easy one.  ""Silvermoon"" Harry's a bit of an eccentric, keeps all sorts of expensive blood elf knickknacks inside his tent - yet when I see him he always pretends to be broke.  Get my gold. "
375,Trident of the Son,Old Icefin wants you to obtain Rotgill's Trident. ,"<From the scratches he makes in the rock, you see several symbols: a trident, a mur'ghoul, the sun, a wrecked ship, and a rough stick-figure of yourself. ><Puzzling out what the murloc is conveying takes a while. Obviously he wants you to get a trident from the Chillmere Coast, but the image of the sun is puzzling. That is until you realize he means his son. ><His son was changed into a mur'ghoul! He wants you to find him to the south near the wrecked ship and return with his trident. >"
376,"""Crowleg"" Dan","Confront ""Crowleg"" Dan, who is in one of the ships at Scalawag Point. ","Croaker's spoken, matey. ""Crowleg"" Dan's on da ship yonder. Best go trace that blaggard, mon.  Show'im dis set's not fe be crossed.  Gaan back fe Terry when ye keelhaul 'is behind. "
377,Break the Blockade,Take Petrov's Cluster Bombs and drop them on enough pirates to kill or destroy 25 Blockade Pirates and 10 Blockade Cannons. ,"All of our ships are sunk! We need your help to break the pirate blockade below in the Shattered Straits! Take these cluster bombs and hitch a ride on the zeppelin that Harrowmeiser has 'loaned' to us.  He'll fly you over the decks of those pirate scoundrels, and you make sure to give it to them good! If you can't bomb them to smithereens, I'm afraid we'll never be able to break the blockade. "
378,A Carver and a Croaker,"Get a Shiny Knife from ""Silvermoon"" Harry and capture a Scalawag Frog. ","Some of the pirates around here. . . we have our own special way of talking. Zeh'gehn has. . . many different special ways of talking. . . all mixed together. From what I can tell he wants a frog and a knife. ""Silvermoon"" Harry might have a knife on the cheap.  There's frogs all over town, just grab one and bring it to him along with the knife. I'd hate to be in the poor critter's shoes, if you know what I mean. "
379,Dead Man's Debt,"Taruk at Scalawag Point wants you to search for Black Conrad's Treasure on the plateau in the northeastern end of the Isle of Spears, just north of Iskaal. ","You might've heard of Black Conrad, he's a famous pirate around these parts. Well, he had a thing for gambling on my fights.  He had a thing for not paying, too. I'd love to collect, but trouble is. . . he's dead. I was about ready to write the whole thing off, when I came across this. . . < Taruk unfolds a map of the Isle of Spears with an X on a northeastern plateau. >He hid his treasure on tuskarr land.  I want you to get it.  I'll be damned if I let that bilge sucker get away without paying. "
380,War is Hell,High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing wants you to take the Burning Torch and use it to burn 10 of the corpses littered to the west of town. ,"We're slowly finishing off the remnants of Stormwind's North Fleet stationed on this coast.  The bodies to the west are a testament to how brutal this confrontation has been. This does not happen to bother my refined aesthetics, but it does present a danger to our lives. In the lands of the Lich King, the dead are a weapon that can rise against us at any point in time.  Take this torch - you're going to make sure that doesn't happen. "
381,Anguish of Nifflevar,Thoralius the Wise wants you to search Nifflevar while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Nifflevar. ,"All that we know of the vrykul indicates that they only recently appeared in Northrend. Why, then, are we seeing vrykul in visions that date back 15, 000 years? Surely if the vrykul had previously existed in Northrend we would have known. You must press on to Nifflevar. To get there you must go northeast, through Wyrmskull Village, and take the path leading up through the dam. Nifflevar is on the bluffs of the fjord. Use the incense burner once you arrive at Nifflevar and search the area for clues. "
382,Necro Overlord Mezhen,Kill Necro Overlord Mezhen. ,"The Scourge are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them! They must be working to bring the vrykul into Arthas' fold. I want the leader of these necrolords eliminated! Do whatever it takes, <name>, but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized. I will not see the vrykul successfully allied with the Scourge! Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron. "
383,The Frost Wyrm and its Master,Slay Wyrmcaller Vile and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay Glacion. ,"Your instincts were right to bring this to me, but my wind riders cannot fight a dragon. You must take help back west with you to Gjalerbron and slay the frost wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile! Even now it may be on its way! If I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will  call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it! And <name>, bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands! "
384,The Walking Dead,"Slay 10 Deathless Watchers, 4 Fearsome Horrors, and 2 Putrid Wights. ","Your assistance to us has been tremendous, <name>, but there is something that is troubling me: these so-called Scourge. The spirits of the land and air, the waters and the fire below the world, would not abide their presence, but seem to do nothing about them. We will see to it that they are dealt with! Perhaps it is asking too much, but I would have you return west to Gjalerbron and destroy the unnatural Scourge in that vile lair. Be sure to check in the Waking Halls below Gjalerbron as well! "
385,Parts for the Job,"""Hacksaw"" Jenny in New Agamand wants you to obtain 6 Shoveltusk Ligaments and 1 Fresh Pound of Flesh. ","So Harris wants a demolition job, eh?  Yeah, I can help out. You're gonna have to get me some parts, though.  I can't afford to use up my choice components on something that's gonna get blown up. First of all, I'm going to need shoveltusk ligaments. . . way better than the human kind. I will also need a pound of flesh.  A fellow known as Anton sells cheap meat.  He travels up and down the road to the west. "
386,Mission: Plague This! ,Captain Adams has ordered you to get 5 bomb hits on the Plague Tanks at New Agamand. ,The Royal Apothecary Society thinks they're going to perfect a new plague to melt us down where we stand? ! Not on my watch! Get out to the courtyard and speak with Greer Orehammer. He's got a gryphon and some bombs ready for you. I want you to bomb the plague tanks at New Agamand to smithereens! 
387,Leader of the Deranged,Slay Squeeg Idolhunter and then report back to Sapper Steelring at Westguard Keep. ,"So, I hate to say it, pal, but while you were out, the captain took a keener interest in that place. Looks like he wants my old Explorers' League boss in there dead. My guess would be that we're gearing up for an offensive to clear out the rest of them, and the captain wants their head lopped off, as it were. Do me a favor? Head back into Whisper Gulch and put an end to Squeeg Idolhunter. From what I remember, my guess would be that he's in the cave in the northwest corner. "
388,The Rune of Command,Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis. ,"Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation. Take it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered. The giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run. "
389,Making the Horn,Nokoma Snowseer at Camp Winterhoof wants you to bring her 6 Undamaged Ram Horns. ,"My people have been hunting the giant yeti of these hills for generations and I will be participating for the first time this year. It will probably be the last before we leave the post forever. To prepare for the hunt, I must fashion a loud horn from the horns of the dire rams that roam the snowy areas near our camp. The elders tell me the sound mimics the mating call of the female yeti, but I have my doubts. Bring me the best dire ram horns you can find, <name>, and I'll select one from among them. "
390,We Have the Technology,Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Pristine Shoveltusk Hide and Steel Ribbing. ,"While the infrastructure for a piece of machinery like this is important, we can't underestimate the appearance of the construct. If we're to fool the iron dwarves the clone must be exact! I can make this happen. Bring me a pristine shoveltusk hide from the shoveltusk of this region and steel ribbing from vrykul in Nifflevar or Baleheim to the northwest. "
391,Jack Likes His Drink,Taruk at Scalawag Point in Howling Fjord wants you to collect Jack Adams' Debt. ,"Our next customer,  Jack Adams, won't be the pushover that Harry was.  He spends all day drinking with his friends, tough pirates all of them.  Let's not use force this time, could get ugly. See if you can use his drinking habit to your advantage.  There's only so much alcohol someone can handle before passing out. Maybe one of the bar wenches will be of assistance.  Once he's out, see if you can slip your hand into his pocket and get what's mine. "
392,Mastering the Runes,Bring a set of Iron Rune Carving Tools to Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar. ,"I've got a set of picks, hammers, and chisels with me, but they won't work for carving these runes. The tools used by the Iron Dwarves are imbued with magic during their forging. When they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist. I believe I know how it works, but without a set of those tools, I can't be certain. Look for kits resembling mine near the Iron Dwarf pavilions at Giants' Run and bring them to me. "
393,Two Wrongs. . . ,Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep has tasked you with the destruction of 3 Proto-Drakes. ,"Now that we've riled up these Ember Clutch proto-drakes, they may be inclined to continue their attacks upon the keep. This will not do. I hate to compound one wrong with another, but in this case it would appear that we will have to destroy the creatures. A regrettable course of action, but one that we need to undertake regardless. Take my wand. I've been experimenting with increasing its range, but it doesn't pack much of a punch. However, what it will do is get a proto-drake 's attention. "
394,Let Them Eat Crow,"Pontius, the kennel keeper at Vengeance Landing, wants you to use the Plaguehound Cage to summon a Hungry Plaguehound and feed it Crow Meat from Fjord Crows west of Vengeance Landing. ","The high executor wants me to use my dogs to sniff out enemy scouts, but I can tell you right now these plaguehounds aren't going anywhere until they're properly fed. If our military doesn't understand that these beasts are picky enough to not eat the rubbish they've given me, then they can't expect them to be of any use in the field. You seem to have some time on your hands, why don't you take one of these dogs out hunting for crows out west?  Their meat isn't very tasty to us, but my boys love it! "
395,Sleeping Giants,Mage-Lieutenant Malister has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul. ,I've overheard what you've had to say with Father Levariol. Allow me to suggest that he's not having you go far enough. You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron! I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely. Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul. 
396,Towers of Certain Doom,The Westguard Sergeant has informed you that using the Sergeant's Flare to target all four of the towers at Skorn for cannon volleys would be advisable. ,"<Sir/Ma'am>, as we move through Skorn, we have to bring down those towers! If you have a look at them, you'll notice that their tops are lined with casters. Getting too close to them would mean certain doom for us! However, we do have it within our means to call in cannon volleys from Westguard Keep. To do so, we need to get close enough so that you can lob a smoke flare atop of them. Just don't get too close! "
397,Mission: Package Retrieval,Scout Knowles has asked you to retrieve the Apothecary's Package from inside Halgrind. ,"Well darn, we need some of that plague-stuff. I know! While you were destroying the vats, I happened to spy one of the apothecaries from New Agamand being pulled into Halgrind by the vrykul down in there. Poor fella'. <name>, I'd bet anything that apothecary has the goods on him. Think you could go into Halgrind and retrieve his package? "
398,Root Causes,Slay 5 Dragonflayer Handlers and Skeld Drakeson. ,"All things in nature seek a balance. It is only through the interference of those not in tune with that harmony that the balance is shifted. You waste your efforts when you kill the whelps and drakes. The real culprits behind the expansion of these magically burning woods are the newly awakened vrykul and their master, Skeld Drakeson. If it's blood on your hands that you seek, start with them. You will find their lair on the south side of the Ember Clutch. "
399,The Conqueror of Skorn! ,Return the Winterhoof Token to Chieftain Ashtotem at Camp Winterhoof. ,"You have done everything that we were sent here to do, <class>. I must admit that you fight well. Your people are not as strange as I first thought. Chieftain Ashtotem is certain to want to hear of your success, but if you decide to stay out here for whatever reason, I will continue to fight at your side. "
400,Stop the Ascension! ,Present the Vrykul Scroll of Ascension near the Thane's Pyre to call him out and slay him. ,"This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual. A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background. A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge. "
401,Danger! Explosives! ,Use Steelring's Foolproof Dynamite to collect 6 Whisper Gulch Ore Fragments and 18 Whisper Gulch Gems. ,"<name>, the captain's tasked me with a mission. I'd like you to help. A bunch of my fellow Explorers' League people went nuts digging up stuff in the Whisper Gulch just to the north. They're attacking anyone trying to get in! The captain is only concerned with the ore for the keep. Lucky for us, I have just the thing to do the trick. Get in there, blow up the ore, and bring it back along with any gems you find. Running this place isn't cheap you know! I gotta warn you though, that ore is strange! "
402,Guide Our Sights,Use the Smoke Flares at the location of the Alliance Cannons on the northern wall of the Derelict Strand. ,"We should be able to kill our way back to our guns.  Unfortunately, visibility is less than desirable so you will have to mark our targets from the ground. Take these smoke flares with you and use them to mark the locations of the cannons along the northern wall in the Derelict Strand, west of here, where the Alliance are holding out. Let Lyana know as soon as the way is clear for the ground troops.  We can take care of ourselves over here. "
403,Necro Overlord Mezhen,Kill Necro Overlord Mezhen. ,"The dead ones are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them? We must eliminate the leader of these necrolords. Do whatever it takes, <name>, but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized. We cannot afford to see the vrykul successful in whatever they are doing with these undead creatures! Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron. "
404,Stop the Ascension! ,Present the Vrykul Scroll of Ascension near the Thane's Pyre to call him out and slay him. ,"This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual. A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background. A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge. "
405,"Burn Skorn, Burn! ",The Winterhoof Brave suggests that you use the Brave's Torch to set fire to the Northeast and Northwest Longhouses and the Barracks at Skorn. ,"Chieftain Ashtotem ordered me to destroy many buildings here. However, you are in charge, so it falls to your hands, <name>. I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of Skorn. All we have to do is get inside each and set them ablaze with this torch. "
406,Dealing With Gjalerbron,"Captain Adams has asked you to kill 15 Gjalerbron Warriors, 8 Gjalerbron Rune-casters, and 8 Gjalerbron Sleep-watchers. ","And now we have a different problem. My scouts that have lived to return have informed me that the vrykul are up to no good at their main fortress to the north. They call the place Gjalerbron, though you'd pronounce the 'Gj' as if it were an 'Sh'. Odd creatures. But that's not important; what is, is that you get up there and put an end to the lives of as many of those creatures as you can while trying to figure out what they're up to. I know that I can count on you, <name>. "
407,The Book of Runes,Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar wants you to bring him The Book of Runes. ,"The vast rocky area to the southeast, Giants' Run, has been overrun by Iron Dwarves. Scouts have reported seeing the dwarves coaxing stone giants from the ground, then carving runes on them. I can't fathom their motives, but I suspect they're somehow trying to turn the giants into weapons. The iron rune stonecallers and binders carry large tomes with them, which must contain the runes they're carving on the giants. Capture the pieces of this book, assemble them, and bring it back to me, <name>. "
408,Mastering the Runes,Bring a set of Iron Rune Carving Tools to Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof. ,"I think I've figured out what the Iron Dwarves are doing. The tools they use are imbued with magic during their forging. When they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist. If I had a set of those tools, I could mimic the runes in the book. I captured one of these boxes from one of the pavilions at Giants' Run, but it was empty. Look for similar boxes and recover a set of tools from them. "
409,Stunning Defeat at the Ring,Defeat the gladiators at the Ring of Judgement and face Oluf the Violent. ,"Oluf will come out if you defeat the other gladiators. That's 'bout the only way we're getting' that cipher back. Put on your whompin' boots and get busy in the Ring of Judgement. If you do manage to get the cipher back, return it to Glorenfeld o'er near the entrance to these catacombs. Me? Don't worry about me! We're on the brink of discovering the missing link to human-kind! "
410,Gjalerbron Attack Plans,Deliver the Gjalerbron Attack Plans to Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep. ,"These plans detail an imminent attack upon Westguard Keep. It would appear that the frost wyrm, Glacion, who circles overhead is to be used for the offensive. Surely Mage-Lieutenant Malister would be of some assistance in this matter. Deliver the plans to him at the keep to the south. "
411,Eyes of the Eagle,Ulfang has asked you to collect the Eyes of the Eagle. ,"Garwal hides himself behind an unnatural magic. None can see him unless he wants you to. There may be one chance we can take, though. My enemy, the great eagle, Talonshrike, is said to have eyes that can see anything. If you were to take her eyes, then you would surely be able to see Garwal. Talonshrike keeps her nest at the base of a waterfall just to the southwest of the vrykul place called Skorn. If you touch the eggs in her nest, she will come down from the sky to kill you. Get her eyes. "
412,In Worg's Clothing,Watcher Moonleaf has asked you to seek out and help Ulfang in the Rivenwood. ,"From my dreams, I know that Ulfang is in a cave on the snowy northwestern edge of the Rivenwood. He is in great danger! I have devised a magical disguise that will make you appear as a worg while you are within the Rivenwood. The disguise is weak, relying upon the strange magics of that haunted wood. While it will only convince the worgs, it will allow you to get close to Ulfang. Please, <class>, find and help him. "
413,Shield Hill,"""Hacksaw"" Jenny wants you to bring her 5 Ancient Vrykul Bones from the reanimated Vrykul in Shield Hill, south of New Agamand. ","My work should be extremely easy in a time of war.  There ought to be usable body parts everywhere. It's not that simple, though.  With these eggheads making all sorts of killer plagues and sending them to enemy towns, most of the material gets contaminated. There is a place, though, where usable samples exist.  Shield Hill, south of here, is an ancient vrykul burial ground where the dead walk but are not afflicted with any plague - ours or the Lich King's.  Get me some bones, I'll pay ya well. "
414,I've Got a Flying Machine! ,The Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist wants you to transport 3 Sacks of Relics from the bottom of the site and take them to the platform on the north or south side of Steel Gate. ,"Well, what are you waiting for, there's work to be done! Here's the keys to our flying machine. Grab three sacks of relics and haul them up to the crane platforms on the north and south sides of Steel Gate.  I'll mark them for you. Hurry up! We haven't got all day! "
415,The Book of Runes,Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof wants you to bring him The Book of Runes. ,"Chieftain Ashtotem dispatched me on a scouting mission to Giants' Run, a broad, rocky plateau to the southeast, past the Frozen Glade. The area has been taken over by Iron Dwarves who seem to be altering the giants as they emerge from the earth. The iron rune stonecallers and binders carry large tomes with them, which must contain the runes they're carving on the giants. Capture the pieces of this book, assemble them, and bring it back to me. It's the only way we'll understand their plans. "
416,The Battered Hilt,"Bring the Battered Hilt to Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds. ","This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art. The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the Sunreavers would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representatives at Quel'Delar's Rest, to the south of the Argent Tournament Grounds. "
417,Return To Myralion Sunblaze,Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest. ,"We must get this book to Myralion Sunblade. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at evading the Silver Covenant's men. Take it with you to Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Myralion will be waiting for you. If he can identify that blade, we may be able to claim it in the name of Aethas Sunreaver and show Dalaran and the Alliance that we will lead the charge against the Lich King. "
418,The Battered Hilt,"Bring the Battered Hilt to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds. ","This battered old sword hilt has seen better days.

Travel to the Violet Citadel in Dalaran as soon as you can, <name> and bring Quel'Delar with you. The archmage wishes to congratulate you personally! "
420,It's All Fun and Games,Destroy The Ocular and then report to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault. ,"The Knights of the Ebon Blade want to take the Scourge base known as The Shadow Vault to the northwest. I have a contact in their group who has asked for help. The first step is to blind the Lich King. He's using a device known as The Ocular to watch the area, which floats above the vault's spires. Our goblins have created something for you to use against it. After the 'eye' has been destroyed, find Baron Sliver on the vault grounds. He's pretending to still be under the Lich King's will. "
421,Tempering The Blade,Temper the Re-forged Quel'Delar in the Crucible of Souls. ,"At last, the pieces of Quel'Delar are rejoined and the blade is whole, but it cannot see battle until you have tempered it. That jagged saronite edge is brittle and will shatter the moment it strikes anything. Deep in Icecrown Citadel's Forge of Souls is a place where the blade can safely be tempered. Take Quel'Delar with you to the abode of the Devourer of Souls and look for the crucible. Plunge the blade into the crucible to temper it and bring it back to me. I'll be waiting in The Frozen Halls. "
422,An Audience With The Arcanist,Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from Arcanist Tybalin. ,"I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Silver Enclave's defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way up to the top level of the Silver Enclave and meet up with the Silver Covenant's man there, known as Arcanist Tybalin. While disguised, obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest, and return the book to me. "
423,A Suitable Disguise,Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Glossgleam. ,"Getting you inside the Silver Enclave will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess Silver Covenant tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work. On the balcony above Threads of Fate, you'll find Shandy Glossgleam. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while. "
424,A Victory For The Silver Covenant,Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to Vereesa Windrunner at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran. ,"In spite of Queen Lana'thel's boasting, you have restored Quel'Delar, <name>.

I do not recognize these particular markings, but we haven't hit a dead end yet. Korialstrasz, better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the quel'dorei and the Kirin Tor. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something. Travel to the top of Wyrmrest Temple and seek his counsel, then report to Magister Hathorel inside Sunreaver's Sanctuary in Dalaran. "
426,Basic Chemistry,Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar. ,"<Koltira takes the pustulant spines and drains their fluid into a flask. >A little-known quality of the flesh giants. . . Their spinal fluid interacts with the plague in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid. Poured from the towering ramparts, acid may not be a welcome sight to the troops below, but at least the victims won't rise up and add to the enemy's numbers. Pour the contents of this flask into one of the plague cauldrons in the western chamber of the death gate. "

Hold no fear in your heart. "
429,The Sum is Greater than the Parts,Mount and take control of Nergeld. ,"Opening the tome, you notice all manner of disgusting illustrations concerning the construction of what the doctor refers to as ""the ultimate weapon""! Clearly the prototype, Nergeld, is the massive flesh giant standing still at the end of the nearby Hall of Horrors. If an army of those things were to be constructed, then it would mean doom. The only way to ensure that doesn't happen is to slay Dr. Terrible! Perhaps if you were to take control of the construct, the doctor would reveal himself? "
430,Return To Caladis Brightspear,Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest. ,"We must get this book to Caladis Brightspear immediately. Would you bring it to him?

450,If He Cannot Be Turned,"Defeat General Lightsbane and then report your success back to Thassarian aboard the gunship, The Skybreaker. ","Death knights, such as General Lightsbane, are held on too tight of a leash to be able to be turned from the Lich King's will except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The general keeps himself within the vault overseeing the creation of new weapons. Disturb one of his weapon racks at the northern forge and I assure you, he will come. I'll send Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper in to help you. If we are to finally own The Shadow Vault, General Lightsbane must fall! "
451,The Crusaders' Pinnacle,Seek out Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle in Icecrown. ,"Stand proud in knowing that it was you who helped establish the Argent Crusade inside the walls of Icecrown, <name>. The Crusaders' Pinnacle now stands in direct defiance of the Lich King and his twisted minions. Highlord Fordring and the crusaders who survived await your arrival at Crusaders' Pinnacle. Travel once more through the Breach and seek out the highlord! "
452,Orgrim's Hammer,Seek out Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer flying above Icecrown. ,"The Argent Crusade pulled my ravaged body from the Broken Front. What a glorious battle, <race>. My axe sang as it cut down Alliance filth and Scourge alike. My time is over. It will be a good death. Carry a message for me, soldier. Our base flies out of reach of Scourge - overhead between Mord'rethar and Aldur'thar. It is called ""Orgrim's Hammer. ""<Hork futilely attempts to salute. >Fly high and avoid the Alliance juggernaut, Skybreaker. Tell Korm. . . tell him I died. . . fighting. . . For the Horde. "
453,Assault by Air,Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim has ordered you to use the Skybreaker Suppression Turret to keep the Skybreaker Troop Transport alive long enough to make all of its drops. ,"I've got some boys suited and ready for their drops inside of Ymirheim. I could use you to see them there safely. Inside the walls, the vrykul have set up some kind of automated spear guns that have been tearing up our transports. We had our engineers install a Suppression Turret to shut down those spear guns - just fire a round near any gun and the smoke should block its sight and clog its gears. Hop on the turret and see to it that all my boys make it to their drops in one piece. "
454,Exploiting an Opening,Speak to Captain Kendall below Icecrown Citadel. ,"I've got an interesting assignment for you, <name>.  If you're up for a challenge, that is. We've been tipped off about an opening below Icecrown Citadel.  Our engineers have studied the layout and have decided it's a structural weakness. We've sent some men there along with some ""borrowed"" saronite bombs.  They're under Captain Kendall 's command. With a little help we could deal a huge blow to the forces of the Scourge.  What do you say, <name>? "
455,Preparations for War,"Speak to Officer Van Rossem to secure passage to the Skybreaker in Icecrown, and then report to High Captain Justin Bartlett. ","You there! You look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown. You may have heard rumors of our failure in assaulting the glacier from the ground, but let me set those concerns to rest. We're now mounting our assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to Azeroth, the Skybreaker. The Horde don't stand a chance, and neither does Arthas. Speak to me when you're ready to depart. "
456,If He Cannot Be Turned,"Defeat General Lightsbane and then report your success back to Koltira Deathweaver aboard the gunship, Orgrim's Hammer. ","Death knights, such as General Lightsbane, are held on too tight of a leash to be able to be turned from the Lich King's will except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The general keeps himself within the vault overseeing the creation of new weapons. Disturb one of his weapon racks at the northern forge and I assure you, he will come. I'll send Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper in to help you. If we are to finally own The Shadow Vault, General Lightsbane must fall! "
457,Blackwatch,Speak to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch in Icecrown. ,"The Scourge has a large facility called the Fleshwerks, dedicated to producing abominations and flesh giants. If we can shut it down, we can deprive the Lich King of a large component of his armies. I've sent Darkrider Arly to the area. She has a small base, Blackwatch, on a ridge overlooking the Fleshwerks and to the west of Corp'rethar. I'm told the Argent Crusade is sending someone to coordinate their efforts there, but the darkrider will know what to do. Find and assist her. "
458,Battle at Valhalas: Final Challenge,Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Prince Sandoval. ,"I'm afraid that your success is going to be your undoing, <name>. <If the val'kyr could turn more white, she would. >Word of your success in Valhalas has reached deep into Icecrown Citadel, stirring one whom you have no desire to meet. Prince Sandoval himself is on his way at this very moment. Gjonner warned you that you should run and I cannot disagree. What will you do? He's on his way. Will you face the blood prince in final battle? "
459,Not a Bug,"Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect 5 Dark Matters and summon a Dark Messenger at Aldur'thar. ","Alright, <friend/missy>, time to plant a bug. Relax, it's not a bug exactly, but it'll serve our purposes. In the northern portion of Aldur'thar the cult's void summoners enslave demonic minions. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of these enslaved minions, and then use their summoning crystal to bring our little spy into being. Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy. "
460,Basic Chemistry,Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar. ,"< Thassarian takes the pustulant spines and drains their fluid into a flask. >A little-known quality of the flesh giants. . . Their spinal fluid interacts with the plague in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid. Poured from the towering ramparts, acid may not be a welcome sight to the troops below, but at least the victims won't rise up and add to the enemy's numbers. Pour the contents of this flask into one of the plague cauldrons in the western chamber of the death gate. "
461,Honor Above All Else,Report to Crusade Commander Entari at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown. ,"Long has been the path to our salvation, young <class>. We have fought across continents, worlds even, to reach this point. Now we face our greatest challenge: the destruction of the Lich King and his Scourge. Alas, we fight this battle divided. The Horde and Alliance are in the throes of war and will lend us no support. We must remain unyielding in our cause! For what choice have we to do otherwise? Do you join the cause? Lend us your strength, <class>! My commander, Entari, awaits you at his post. "
462,The Skybreaker,Seek out High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker flying above Icecrown. ,"We were neck deep in Scourge and Horde. The screams of the dying covered that field. It was torturous. . . unrelenting! At some point my body gave out. I fell, only to be awoken by the Argent Crusade. They pulled me out of the Broken Front and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, <race>? Our base, the Skybreaker, flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the Alliance. "
463,Light Within the Darkness,Bring Crusader Bridenbrad's Tabard to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle. ,"< Crusader Bridenbrad's tabard rests in the bottom of the chest, shifting slightly as the howling wind finds its way in. >Tirion will desire this last remnant of the great crusader. "
464,Killohertz,"Chief Engineer Boltwrench wants you to find Kibli Killohertz at the hidden Alliance airport above Aldur'thar, the Desolation Gate. ","The goblins got lucky and found a new energy.  They call it infra-green, and I'll be a one-eyed ogre if those psychos didn't strike green gold. Go find Kibli Killohertz.  He's leading the reverse engineering efforts of infra-green, at a small, hidden Alliance airport above Aldur'thar, the Desolation Gate.  I'll give you infra-green vision to help you find it.  Go to the dome with our Alliance banners -- if you fly near the Horde airport then you'll be in a load of green trouble. "
465,Tirion's Gambit,"Tirion Fordring, at the Crusader's Pinnacle, wants you to obtain and wear a Cultist Acolyte's Hood and meet him at the entrance of the Cathedral of Darkness, northwest of Icecrown Citadel. ","Just this morning, my scouts informed me of a Cult of the Damned procession leaving from Icecrown Citadel to the Cathedral of Darkness, bearing an artifact. And now I learn that it might be Arthas's own heart. . . a thing containing the last bit of his remaining humanity. This is a sign of the Light.  As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that Arthas Menethil can become a man again! Meet me at the cathedral's entrance.  Be sure to bring a cultist's hood -- we're going incognito. "
466,Putting Olakin Back Together Again,"Obtain a Spool of Thread and the Doctor's Cleaver, then take them to the Sanctum of Reanimation Slab and use Olakin's remains to attempt to reanimate the crusader. ","We can't afford to waste any time putting Olakin back together. Fortunately, the Scourge has provided a perfect place for you to stitch him back together. Near the Fleshwerks' flesh giant lab is the Sanctum of Reanimation. Search the area for a spool of thread and the doctor's cleaver. Then, take Olakin's remains to the large slab in the middle of the sanctum and get to work. "
467,Reading the Bones,The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village has instructed you to collect 15 Vrykul Bones. ,"One of the benefits of possessing this creature is that I have access to all of her powers. As a bone witch and rune reader, she has the power to throw the bones and determine one's fate. < The Bone Witch smirks. >Lucky for you and I that I have it within my power to influence those readings. Bring me the bones of the vrykul that you kill here in Jotunheim and I will toss them to allow you to determine your own fate. "
468,Intelligence Gathering,Aurochs Grimbane at Death's Rise wants you to collect 5 Onslaught Intel Documents. ,"I need to know what the Scarlet Onslaught is planning today. You will be my instrument in this task. Fly to Onslaught Harbor and rifle through their baggage trunks for documents. The trunks will be locked, so you'll have to take the keys from the Scarlet Onslaught members by whatever means. "
469,Second Chances,Kill Archbishop Landgren and then summon Arete's Gate in the presence of his corpse. ,"I'd heard they have an archbishop in their cathedral, but I had no idea that they'd resurrected and promoted Landgren! The Crimson Cathedral is heavily guarded with only one entrance, so you'll need help. We still need to know where the grand admiral is, but this time we're not taking any chances! Take this device. It can be used to summon a gate for me to step through once you've killed the archbishop. I'll have my answers directly from his compelled soul! We will find Grand Admiral Westwind! "
470,Judgment Day Comes! ,Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown. ,"We cannot defeat the Lich King on our own. Divided we shall all fall! I implore you to answer the call, <brother/sister>. The Argent Crusade accepts all who would volunteer to aid in the war effort. Highlord Tirion Fordring himself awaits you at the Argent Vanguard! Get upon your mount and fly to the southeastern reaches of Icecrown. It is there that you will find Lord Fordring and the soldiers of the Argent Crusade. Go now, <class>, for judgment day comes! "
471,The Boon of Remulos,Return to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown with the Emerald Acorn. ,"I shall open a portal to take you back to the druid that brought you here. You and your crusader have my well wishes. I hope that this acorn is able to purify your crusader and save him from the wretched fate of the plague. Farewell, <race>. "
472,Opportunity,Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel. ,"We recently came upon schematics that indicate a weakness in Icecrown Citadel.  An opening in its defenses, both figuratively and literally. The captured diagrams show an orifice leading several hundred feet into the ground.  We're unsure of its purpose, but our scouting has revealed it to be of high importance to the Scourge. Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel, she's leading the attack on the site. "
473,The Scourgestone,The Ebon Watcher at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to bring him 15 Scourgestones. ,"A Scourgestone is an item given to all Scourge upon birth or creation. It provides certain benefits to the holder, but more importantly it allows Scourge leaders visibility into the location and movement of all of their units. With enough Scourgestones, I might be able to track the movement of other Scourge units across Icecrown. As you slaughter Scourge in Scourgeholme, gather all of the Scourgestones that you find. Return to me when your bags are full. "
474,Hope Within the Emerald Nightmare,Keeper Remulos at Moonglade has instructed you to enter the emerald dream and recover 3 Emerald Acorns. ,"What we need exists only in the emerald dream. . . acorns that are infused with a powerful restorative magic. Many places in this sacred glade are closely tied with the dream, and my shrine is among them. I will send you into the dream to recover some of these acorns. Be prepared though <class>, for this method of entering the dream is dangerous, and it is very likely you will be beset by nightmares. Recover a few acorns quickly, and then depart from my shrine or pinch yourself to return to our world. "
475,The Shadow Vault,Report back to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault. ,"It sounds like you did extremely well. And you secured three very important allies for the Knights of the Ebon Blade in the process. < Thassarian gazes out over the horizon. >You should head back. By now, Baron Sliver and the other death knights will be fighting tooth and nail to hold The Shadow Vault against the might of the Scourge. I'm sure they'll need your help. "
476,Neutralizing the Plague,Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar. ,"You no longer need my assistance in neutralizing the enemy's plague cauldrons, <race>. Hunt down the flesh giants at the death gate and use the fluid from their spines to render batches of the plague ineffective. You are striking at the heart of the enemy's strategy. This is an important mission - vital to our cause, and should be carried out whenever time permits. Remember, the giants and the plague cauldrons can be found on Mord'rethar. "
477,You'll Need a Gryphon,Deliver an Onslaught Gryphon to Uzo Deathcaller at Death's Rise. ,"What could be more fitting than to take one of their own gryphons to use against them? Go to Onslaught Harbor and take the reins to one of their gryphons from the dead clutches of its rider. Return with the gryphon, delivering it to Uzo Deathcaller. He will see to its proper transformation and provide you with further instructions. "
478,Find the Ancient Hero,The Bone Witch at Njorndar Village wants you to return with Iskalder. ,"Quickly, <name>, head southwest to the Halls of the Ancestors! Within you will find slumbering mjordin. Wake them until you find Iskalder. When you do, use this amulet upon him and bring him back to me. Now go. There is no time to waste! "
479,Shadow Vault Decree,"Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault has ordered you to read the Shadow Vault Decree in the presence of Thane Ufrang the Mighty, and then to slay him. ","Thane Ufrang the Mighty sits within his hall overlooking the Savage Ledge. I've studied him. The thane is a patient vrykul, with a head for strategy and warfare. He's also shown a penchant for biding his time and not wanting to overplay his hand in the ongoing battle. I need him dead! I've written a decree. Stand before the thane and read it aloud. <The duke arches his eyebrow in amusement. >It should. . . unnerve him at the least. "
480,The Bone Witch,Speak with The Bone Witch within the cave at Njorndar Village. ,"You remember Lady Nightswood, don't you? She certainly remembers you. She's the forlorn and very angry banshee that you 'saved' when you also broke Vile and myself out from under the Lich King's dominion. The lady has gone into Jotunheim and possessed their bone witch. She intends to wreak havoc upon the vrykul from within. She has asked that you seek her out. You'll find her in the cave on the south side of Njorndar Village to the southwest within Jotunheim. "
481,Not-So-Honorable Combat,The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village wants you to defeat Iskalder upon Battlescar Spire. ,"Atop the tallest peak to the southwest overlooking Jotunheim is Battlescar Spire. It is a place of reverence for the vrykul, second only to Valhalas in terms of where they prefer to do honorable combat. We shall visit not-so-honorable combat upon it. Gather your companions and fly to the spire. When you are ready, light the signal fire and I will appear within the body of Iskalder. We will fight, you will win, and Vardmadra is sure to come to witness the battle! "
482,The Grand (Admiral's) Plan,Deliver the Note from the Grand Admiral to Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise. ,"At first this note looks like any of the other intel that you've been looking for. However, a quick perusal of its contents disabuses you of this notion. The letter conveys that Grand Admiral Westwind is present somewhere on the island, but that he is keeping himself secluded for now. He speaks of a glorious day that is coming soon in which the Scarlet Onslaught will wash over first the Lich King and then the rest of world to finally bring order to Azeroth. The lord-commander will want to see this! "
483,Where Are They Coming From? ,"Investigate a Summoning Altar in the eastern part of the Fleshwerks, then report back to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch. ","The Lich King's tireless minions labor away night and day to assemble scores of abominations and flesh giants down there in the Fleshwerks. Yet, that is not enough. More and more skeletal constructors keep appearing to increase the pace of work. If we do not discover where they're coming from and how they're able to work so quickly, we'll be overrun before we can act in force. Search to the southeast and see if you can find the source of these skeletons. "
484,No Rest For The Wicked,"Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to defeat Alumeth the Ascended at Aldur'thar. ","These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans! The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul. If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary. Combine his heart, skull, scepter and robes from around their chamber and use his remains on the crystal there. Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful! "
485,Need More Info,"Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the Cult Researchers at Aldur'thar and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis. ","The Cult of the Damned are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time. . . . Perhaps it's the proximity to the Lich King that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident than ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way to strip them of it! I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details. "
486,Battle at Valhalas: Fallen Heroes,"Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to, in a single combat, defeat all six of the fallen heroes: Eldreth, Geness Half-Soul, Jhadras, Masud, Rith, and Talla. ","If you believe yourself ready to begin then I have just the match for you to cut your teeth on. Another group of outsiders thought themselves prepared for the rigors of Valhalas. They had much hubris, but in the end they fell like all of the others. If you think yourselves so different -- if you think that you have the skill and experience to fight here amongst such storied warriors -- then please accept the challenge. "
487,That's Abominable! ,"Koltira Deathweaver on Orgrim's Hammer wants you to use the Abomination Reanimation Kit to create a Reanimated Abomination, which you are to use to kill 15 Icy Ghouls, 15 Vicious Geists, and 15 Risen Alliance Soldiers. ","Abominations. . . They can be a very capable enemy. I've seen them turn the tide of battle more than once. What few realize, is that they can also be very capable friends. They are not deep thinkers. If you know the secrets of their creation, you can issue them basic orders that they will not question. Fortunately for you, I know these secrets. This kit will reanimate the remains of the abominations you defeat. Take it, and learn to use them against the Scourge on the death gate. "
488,Judgment Day Comes! ,Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown. ,"We cannot defeat the Lich King on our own. Divided we shall all fall! I implore you answer the call, <brother/sister>. The Argent Crusade accepts all that would volunteer to aid in the war effort. Highlord Tirion Fordring himself awaits you at the Argent Vanguard! Get upon your mount and fly to the southeastern reaches of Icecrown. It is there that you will find Lord Fordring and the soldiers of the Argent Crusade. Go now, <class>, for judgment day comes! "
489,Death's Gaze,"Use the Death's Gaze Orb to place orbs on the Abomination Lab Orb Stand, the Flesh Giant Lab Orb Stand, and the Cauldron Area Orb Stand, then return to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch. ","The Fleshwerks is a vast operation, and it will be difficult to keep an eye on all that transpires there. Fortunately, I have a plan. <Arly produces an orb from the folds of her cloak and shows it to you. >This is a death's gaze orb. With it, we can observe the Scourge's actions and decide how best to strike. Place these orbs on the stands at three crucial areas -- the abomination lab and the flesh giant lab to the southwest, along with the area surrounding the green cauldron far to the west. "
490,Destroying the Altars,"Kill Master Summoner Zarod and use his Summoning Stave to destroy the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Summoning Altars. ","So they're summoning in their workers and warriors at those altars? They'll need to be the first thing to go. The master summoner should have a staff which allows him to activate the portal. If you kill the master summoner and take the staff, you can use it to overload the summoning portal and destroy its altar. Do this at all four of the altars and return to me once they've been destroyed. "
491,New Recruit,Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering has requested that you bring a subdued Lithe Stalker to the top of the rocks northeast of the Rise of Suffering. ,"First things first. I saw some Lithe Stalkers on the ramparts just east of us. They used to serve us before we broke with Arthas, and they're about as perfect a scout as you can get. . . with a little prodding from an eye of dominion. Fly up, find one of the stalkers, beat it down a bit, and then use this Sigil of the Ebon Blade to command its obedience. It will recognize the sigil, guaranteed. Lead it back to the top of the rocks northeast of here and it will find its way to me. "
492,A Victory For The Sunreavers,Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to Justicar Mariel Trueheart at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"At last, Quel'Delar is restored for the glory of the Sunreavers! All the Horde will celebrate you as a hero, <name>. As a <class>, the sword seems to know you lack the training to wield it and hasn't bonded to you. Where, then, will its next master come from? I will not conceal my disappointment; I had hoped it would be a worthy sin'dorei. Let us seek the Argent Crusade's counsel. Go north to the Argent Tournament Grounds and present the sword to Justicar Mariel Trueheart on behalf of the Sunreavers. "
493,Stunning View,Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering wants you to use a Lithe Stalker's heave ability to destroy 12 sleeping Iceskin Sentries. ,"Gargoyles make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have a very obvious weakness. Most of them have to go through long periods resting as stone to maintain the energy they need to carry their heavy bodies through the air. As I peered through the eye you were using, I noticed dozens of iceskin sentries resting on the eastern and southern walls inside. Use the stalker to leap up to their ledges and devastate them while they sleep. "
494,An Undead's Best Friend,Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault wants you to use the Eidolon Watcher to feed 18 Hungering Plaguehounds. ,"As is usual practice, the undead at the saronite quarry to the southwest starve plaguehounds to keep them extra aggressive. Use the shade to get up close and feed some of those hounds and I promise you they'll be content to leave you alone, if not side with the hand that fed them. Don't get too close to those things until you've fed them though. Their noses don't fall victim to your shade's elusiveness. "
495,Get the Key,Vaelen the Flayed at Ufrang's Hall has asked you to retrieve the Key to Vaelen's Chains. ,"<class>, the key to my shackles is hanging around the neck of Instructor Hroegar outside. Perhaps you could retrieve it by separating his head from his shoulders? "
496,"I Have an Idea, But First. . . ","Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault has asked you to collect a Cultist Rod, an Abomination Hook, a Geist Rope, and 5 Scourge Essences. ","When I was in the - ahem - employ of the Lich King, we would often use a device known as a sovereign rod to keep some of the more intelligent Scourge in line. I require that you assist me in the construction of a new one. Luckily for you, all of the necessary components are at hand: a cultist rod, an abomination hook, a geist rope, and a handful of Scourge essences. This should not be difficult, <class>. "
497,A Cold Front Approaches,Report to Siegemaster Fezzik at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown. ,"The chill of death stirs in the west, threatening to freeze our hearts and souls to this wasteland and bind us to its dark master. We will stand and we will fight! The preparations have begun. Report to Siegemaster Fezzik at the front gate for your assignment. "
498,No Rest For The Wicked,"Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to slay Alumeth the Ascended at Aldur'thar. ","These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans! The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul. If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary. Combine his heart, skull, scepter and robes from around their chamber and use his remains on the crystal there. Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful! "
499,Green Technology,Speak with Fringe Engineer Tezzla. ,"Tezzla is the one you want to meet, yes she is. . . she mastered a new wavelength, infra-green, and used it to hide herself near the Scourge!  Near enough to bomb them! I'll give you infra-green vision so you can find her hiding above Aldur'thar, the Desolation Gate.  Go, go. . . I know she has work for brave heroes eager to blow up!  I mean. . . eager to blow up the Scourge! And <name>, the Alliance has stolen our technology and has their own hidden airport nearby.  Avoid the dome with the Alliance banners! "
500,Field Repairs,"Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect 5 Demolisher Parts from the Scavenging Geists and take them to the Wrecked Demolisher in the Valley of Lost Hope. ","All right.  Let's not celebrate just yet.  We need to capitalize on the momentum we've gathered with our little bombing mission. We've spotted a workable Horde demolisher-class catapult in the field below.  The geist seem to be taking it apart. If you can put it back together, we'll be able to do some serious damage to the Scourge's armies in the Valley. Sure, you'll be a little outnumbered, but I've a lot of faith in you! "
501,Preparations for War,"Speak to Sky-Reaver Klum to secure passage to Orgrim's Hammer in Icecrown, and then report to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar. ","You there! You look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown. The Alliance scum rushed into Icecrown ahead of us, unprepared, and got just what they deserved for their impatience. We took our time, we made ready, and soon we will mount a true assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to Azeroth - Orgrim's Hammer. The Alliance don't stand a chance, and neither does Arthas. Speak to me when you're ready to depart and lend a hand. "
502,Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend,Deliver Father Gustav's Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown. ,"Silas and Spitzpatrick have signed off on the materials and fuel needed to begin construction of Justice Keep. Thanks to you and the Ebon Blade the Scourge presence within Scourgeholme has been decimated and their lieutenants have been defeated. I have chosen the site at which we will break ground, but first you must deliver my report to Highlord Tirion Fordring. We will begin our march into Icecrown on his command. "
503,If There Are Survivors. . . ,Speak with Penumbrius at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown. ,"Across the Valley of Echoes, west of here, and through the Breach, is the first Scourge encampment in Icecrown known as Scourgeholme. We fought a good fight at Scourgeholme and killed many Scourge, but in the end we were forced to retreat. Many soldiers were left behind - their fate unknown. If there are survivors, we must attempt a rescue. Directly down this southeastern path is Penumbrius, ally of the bronze dragonflight and caretaker of the proto-brood. Seek him out and ask for his assistance. "
504,Assault by Air,Ground Commander Xutjja at the edge of the glacier north of Ymirheim has ordered you to use the Kor'kron Suppression Turret to keep the Kor'kron Troop Transport alive long enough to make all of its drops. ,"Alright scrub, I've got something to keep you from being a complete waste. A unit of highly trained infiltrators is ready to be dropped inside of Ymirheim. The vrykul inside have automated spear guns that have been ripping our transports to shreds, so we had the engineers on Orgrim's Hammer whip us up a suppression turret. You're the gunner. Launch rounds at their spear guns to obscure their vision and clog their gears. See to it that my men all make their drops and the transport stays in one piece. "
505,Argent Aid,Speak to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Crusader's Pinnacle. ,"There were rumors about the events you speak of among the death knights.  I always expected the story to be more. . . symbolic. We must warn others, but we must be discreet.  As soon as the Lich King knows we're making our move, he'll move the location of the heart -- we'll never get a chance like this again. The Horde and the Alliance have been infiltrated by the Cult of the Damned before.  The Ebon Blade operates too close to the Scourge. We have to speak to Tirion Fordring and his Argent Crusade. "
506,Eliminate the Competition,"The Leaper at The Shadow Vault wants you to duel and defeat Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun and Tinky Wickwhistle. ","Mrrfrmrfrrmrrr. . . < The Leaper clears his throat. >Sorry about that. It can sometimes be hard to understand what I'm saying. You know how it is. I wanted to make sure that if you find yourself at the Savage Ledge, over the mountains to the west, that you make sure to eliminate the competition there. Specifically, I'd like you to challenge to duels and humiliate Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun, and Tinky Wickwhistle in front of the vrykul. "
507,Generosity Abounds,Vereth the Cunning wants you to use the Lithe Stalker's Iron Chain to drag Scourge Bombs to 4 Lumbering Atrocities inside Malykriss. ,"We need to cause some disruption. . . anything to bring those death knights away from their leaders. If we lay waste to their minions below, I suspect they'll have to devote more attention to keeping a close eye on operations. Abominations are easy prey - slow, predictable, and most importantly, stupid. Take advantage of their trust of the stalkers to drag them some of the Scourge bombs scattered throughout the construction area. You'll be able light the bombs far before they figure out what's going on. "
508,The Hunter and the Prince,Matthias Lehner in the Court of Bones wants you to look for a Bloodstained Stone and complete the Prince's Destiny. ,"Before the prince became a king, he fought many battles. . . but only one where he came close to dying. It was fought right here.  After you let me show you what happened, you'll understand everything. Find a bloodstained stone and pick it up from the floor.  You'll see what happened. "
509,Parting Gifts,Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault wants you to use an Eye of Dominion to take control of a captured Eidolon Watcher. ,"Look what we have here. . . eyes of dominion. The Cult normally goes to great lengths to keep these things safe, but I suppose their options for retreat are few when we're slaughtering them in their own home. The eyes allow a being of any relative power to control an undead minion's actions precisely. As you can imagine, this can be extremely useful when it comes to your typical clumsy ghoul or skeleton. Care to try your hand at it? Use one of the eyes to control a captured shade. "
510,The Art of Being a Water Terror,The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village wants you to possess a Water Terror and use it to slay 10 vrykul in the greater Jotunheim region. ,"The water lock outside my cave is teeming with elementals that the vrykul magi have yet to tame.

511,The Rider of the Unholy,"Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering wants you to kill Rokir, the Rider of the Unholy. ","It's time that we start cutting off the heads of the beast. I served beside Rokir for quite some time. He knows the unholy arts better than most any other death knight I've met and he's equally as ruthless. Rokir 's strengths are most apparent when you are fighting him on his own ground. Sadly, we don't have much option in those regards, but stay on your feet to avoid his undead minions and you should come out victorious. Be nimble, <class>, and do not take him lightly. "
512,Need More Info,"Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the Cult Researchers at Aldur'thar and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis. ","The Cult of the Damned are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time. . . . Perhaps it's the proximity to the Lich King that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident than ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way to strip them of it! I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details. "
513,Retest Now,Chief Engineer Boltwrench aboard the Skybreaker wants you to throw a Writhing Mass into a cauldron at Aldur'thar. ,"This should do the trick! Those twisted hooligans are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then I say we help 'em out a bit! Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty. . . I'm almost positive that its only effect will be to detect any cultist's essence once you've defeated them. When you've collected a bunch of them, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls into any of their cauldrons. Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine! "
514,Cradle of the Frostbrood,"Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to slay 5 Wyrm Reanimators, 8 Cultist Corrupters and 3 Vrykul Necrolords at Sindragosa's Fall.

The Cult of the Damned operate there, under close supervision of the Lich King's undead vrykul lackeys. It is a place of great power, possibly a blue dragonflight graveyard.  The feared frostbrood are raised there from the bones of blue dragons. An attack there would have great impact on the enemy's access to frost wyrms.  Are you up to it, <name>? "
515,The Hunter and the Prince,Matthias Lehner in the Court of Bones wants you to look for a Bloodstained Stone and complete the Prince's Destiny. ,"Before the prince became a king, he fought many battles. . . but only one where he came close to dying.

517,A Hero's Burden,Kill Artruis the Heartless. ,"Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done. We need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar. . . the Sundered Shard. The corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway.

Our enemies have forced my hand and the fury of the titans will cleanse all. "

521,The Sapphire Queen,Bring the Stinger of the Sapphire Queen to High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill. ,"Bristlepine can be dangerous, but most stay far away from wolvar.

I wanted to take down a ferocious lion named Pitch. He's said to make his home south of here, near where the Wildgrowth Mangal meets the northern face of the Skyreach Pillar.

It appears that a key fits inside a large stone keyhole. Perhaps one of the guardians in the vicinity has this key in its possession. 
564,Reconnaissance Flight,Help Pilot Vic complete the Reconnaissance Flight. ,"It's about time we had planes up and running in this place.  The professor's been asking me to check out a strange weather pattern coming from the northeast. Thing is, I'm going to need a co-pilot if we're going into uncharted territory.  No way in hell I'm heading out there alone. What do you say, <tough-guy/hotshot>?  You might learn a thing or two.  And once you learn to deal with the northern winds. . . you can pretty much fly anywhere. "
565,An Issue of Trust,Obtain Freya's trust by destroying 6 Blighted Corpses and 10 Bonescythe Ravagers in the Lost Lands. ,"This should never have happened.  The forces of undeath storm the very cradle of life! If you're not here to destroy the minions of the Lich King, then leave at once.  Do not incur my wrath by distracting me from my duties. "
566,The Great Hunter's Challenge,Kill 60 Game Animals while you aid Hemet and his companions in their hunting. ,"So y'have something of a hunter's instinct. You're not a bad shot, and Hemet hasn't driven you out, so he must be planning on including you in the hunt. How'd you like to have a bit of a competition, just me and you? Hemet and the others will ask you to help in their hunting. Along the way, you and I will count up the kills we contribute to their goals. Now, this isn't something you can win in the blink of an eye, and you'll find yourself killing many different kinds of creatures. Good luck! "
567,Make the Bad Snake Go Away,High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to kill Venomtip and 10 Emperor Cobras. ,"We were here long before the puppy-men came. This is very sacred place - we will not leave. You seem like maybe you good, but we have Lafoo stay with you just in case. You understand we think. There snakes thing that keeps trying to eat our hatchlings. Go with Lafoo and make them stop, okay? Especially big one near waterfall to northeast. "
568,Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator,Kill 15 Dreadsabers and return to Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp. ,"If you've hunted with Hemet before, you know that he's tested his skill against many large cats, but the dreadsabers here in Sholazar are different. They're able to bring down larger game than I've ever seen a cat hunt. To overcome and kill such a predator is the mark of a true hunter. If you seek to prove you're up to the challenge, test yourself against the dreadsabers. They live in the wilderness surrounding the camp and south of the river. "
569,A Mammoth Undertaking,Bring a Shattertusk Mammoth to Zootfizzle at Dorian's Outpost. ,"Before you go off challenging Broodmother Slivina, Dorian thought it might be a good idea for you and Hemet to coordinate your efforts by riding into battle on the back of a mammoth. The area around the camp is full of them. Just take this bridle and skip it over the head of a shattertusk mammoth. Be careful of the bulls, though. They won't tolerate the harness at all. Bring the mammoth back here when you've found a suitable one. "
570,"Kick, What Kick? ","Using the RJR Rifle, shoot the apple on top of Lucky Wilhelm's head, then speak with Drostan. ","So you think you can shoot? Well, let's give it a try. Here, we'll start you out with something nice and gentle. Don't worry, it's got no kick to it at all. Remember, don't point that gun at anything you don't intend to fire at. Now, when you're ready, just take aim at that apple on top o' old Lucky Wilhelm's head and let 'er fly! "
571,Force of Nature,"Travel to the Blight Line, between Rainspeaker Rapids and the Lost Lands in Sholazar Basin and seek the Avatar of Freya. ","I'm not sure about what I saw while flying to the northeast, but to me it looked like a gigantic woman kicking some Scourge butt. I'd heard the professor talk about a certain ""lifewarden""  appointed by the titans to look over Sholazar.  I might not be a titan historian, but it sounds like she fits the bill. I also know that if the Scourge cross the border between the Lost Lands and the rest of Sholazar, our expedition's as good as dead.  What do you say you go look for her and lend a hand? "
572,Tools of War,Retrieve some of Zepik's traps from his stash in Kartak's Hold. ,"Zepik tell me that you maybe the best gorloc hunter he met. . . other than Zepik. Still big battle to southwest - you go help. Zepik keeps some of biggest, baddest traps in his stash at Kartak's Hold. . . told Vekgar to use them for battle, so you use them too. Go pick out any traps you want and kill lots of big-tongues. Lots and lots! "
573,Return of the Friendly Dryskin,Return to Rainspeaker Canopy and speak to High-Oracle Soo-say. ,"Yay! Soo-say probably worrying about us! Maybe you go back to town and tell him everything okay? Yeah, go tell Soo-say. I going grab shiny ball thing from dead lich guy - I meet you there! Go go! I meet you there! "
574,Flown the Coop! ,Capture 12 Chicken Escapees for Elder Harkek. ,Dumb Goregek stumble into chicken house and let all the chickens go! They all around hill - go get chickens back! < Elder Harkek shoos you away. >
575,Wipe That Grin Off His Face,Kill Foreman Swindlegrin and Meatpie and return to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp. ,"We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and  isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight. The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig. Remember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, <name>. "
576,Song of Reflection,"Soo-nee at Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to use the Didgeridoo of Contemplation at the top of the Glimmering Pillar, the Suntouched Pillar, the Mosslight Pillar and the Skyreach Pillar. ","Of course you not as smart as gorloc!  You just simple <race>. You not without hope, though!  You show you can learn.  Maybe crystals make you smart like crystals make us smart! I teach you to play song to clear your mind.  You play song by crystals then crystals make your mind better. . . not as good as gorloc's but better than you have now.  Lifeblood Pillar is broken, but other pillars still good! "
577,Appeasing the Great Rain Stone,High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to take a companion to dig up and collect 6 Shiny Treasures. ,Since mosswalker been attacked I worried maybe we not good to Great Rain Stone. . . we maybe too greedy. We need more treasures to offer! You good at finding shinies last time. . . maybe you go look more around village for shinies? You maybe need one of good Rainspeakers for help. Just tell us who. 
578,In Search of Bigger Game,Speak with Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost in Sholazar Basin. ,"Well, <name>, you've certainly proven your mettle as a hunter of all kinds of game animals -- rhinos, cats, and crocolisks. For some members of the expedition, these creatures are sufficient to test their hunting skills, but others, like myself, crave larger challenges. Dorian Drakestalker went north, across Bittertide Lake and established a camp there. He's heard rumors of gigantic primordial drakes. Just imagine what a quarry they would be! Go check up on Dorian and see if he's had any luck. "
579,Chicken Party! ,Capture 12 Chicken Escapees for Elder Harkek at Frenzyheart Hill. ,"I bet you not guess what happen again. Nope, not Goregek or chickens. Okay, I lie. Goregek let chickens out again. Dumb Goregek and rumbly belly. Let me know if you need help from any of the hunters. . . they around here somewhere. "
580,Rhino Mastery: The Test,Kill 15 Shardhorn Rhinos and return to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Base Camp. ,"No rough landing is going to stop ol' Hemet from mastering the largest game Sholazar has to offer. In the wilds northwest of the camp, the jungles are ruled by the mighty shardhorn rhino. You can prove your worth to the expedition, <lad/lass>, by showing me that you're tough enough to face down those powerful beasts. "
581,Powering the Waygate - The Maker's Perch,The Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids wants you to go to the Maker's Perch and use the Activation Switch Gamma. ,"It is time then.  Let us activate the waygate. You will find the first switch inside the Maker's Perch in the western edge of the basin. Beware, <name>.  The titans used the perch to watch over their creations.  Many of their stone servants still guard the place. "
582,Secret Strength of the Frenzyheart,"Using the secret Frenzyheart drink, slaughter 30 of the Sparktouched Gorlocs around Kartak's Hold. ","Battle still going at Kartak hold. . . I think it time for you to learn big secret of Frenzyheart. We have berries we keep from other lands we came from. . . they not so special on their own, but mix them with drunk drinks and they make Frenzyheart super strong. You a Frenzyheart now. . . it time you get to be strong too. I give some drink, then you be super strong and you go smash all the spark big-tongues. "
583,An Embarassing Incident,Look for Vic's Keys inside the lake at River's Heart. ,"There's one little problem we have to solve before we head out.  You see, I can't seem to find the keys to my flying machine. I've looked pretty much everywhere for them. . . maybe you can give me a hand.  Only place I haven't looked yet is inside the lake. I'll even give you my very own air tank.  It's almost empty, but it's got a couple of hits left. "
584,The Lost Mistwhisper Treasure,Kill Warlord Tartek and retrieve the Mistwhisper Treasure for Mistcaller Soo-gan at Mistwhisper Refuge. ,"So some puppy-men come and smash blue crystals at Great Mist Stone! Lots of rain and lightning and badness. . . blue is wrong crystal for Great Mist Stone! Dumb puppy-men. After lightning, puppy-men stole big treasure we found in the sea-lake. We need treasure back to give to Great Mist Stone! Mist Stone is angry after what the puppy-men did! One who took it named Tarter. . . no, Tiktak. . . no, no. . . Tartek. That it, Tartek! He went to the camp thing to north. Go get treasure back! "
585,"Have a Part, Give a Part",Bring 7 Venture Co. ,"Great, now that we've got an engine, we're going to need an assortment of other parts to get her back in flying condition. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. A good mechanic can hold his creations together with anything, but we're better off if it doesn't come to that. Anyway, those Venture Company dullards have plenty of spare parts for their mining equipment all over Swindlegrin's Dig on the far side of that yellow crystal pillar to the northeast. Scoop up a few and bring them back here. "
586,Lakeside Landing,Speak with Tamara Wobblesprocket at Lakeside Landing. ,"When the trouble with the Venture Company started, I asked Marvin Wobblesprocket and his wife, Tamara, to take their flying machines east to River's Heart. I asked them to setup a small camp there so that we could use them as a relay to fly in supplies and survey the area. They should have arrived by now and started setting up. River's Heart is near the center of the basin where the rivers converge. Search for Lakeshore Landing on the northeast shore. Marvin mentioned it would be the best spot. "
587,Powering the Waygate - The Maker's Overlook,The Avatar of Freya wants you to head to the Maker's Overlook in eastern Sholazar Basin and use the Activation Switch Theta. ,"We cannot stop now, <race>.  You've triggered the first switch, but one remains. The titans constructed a second vantage point where they oversaw their creations.  You'll find it to the east, high in the mountains. Pull the activation switch theta inside the overlook and the waygate will open. "
588,Securing the Bait,Bring 6 Primordial Hatchlings to Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost. ,"We're not likely to get Broodmother Slivina's attention waving our arms around like fools, but if we're smart, we can bait her into fighting us. We'll also secure more, uh, fodder for my little project. <Dorian glances over at Zootfizzle. >But don't worry about that for now. Just look for the primordial drake eggs in the area east and northeast of the camp. Burst them open and scoop up the hatchlings that come out. When the broodmother realizes what we've done, she'll have no choice but to face us. "
589,Salvaging Life's Strength,The Avatar of Freya wants you to go to the Sundered Shard to the southeast and use the Lifeforce Gem on 8 destroyed Lifeblood Elementals. ,"The Lifeblood Pillar was toppled over with great force, sending the very earth into an upheaval. The elementals that wander the sundered shard carry with them the very life essence that gave the pillar its strength.  I cannot allow this energy to be wasted, for only four pillars remain. Head to the sundered shard, to the southeast, and seek the lifeblood elementals. Use this gem on their remains to recover their rampant energy.  We'll need the energy to heal the land when all this is over. "
590,Mischief in the Making,High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill wants 8 Skyreach Crystal Clusters. ,"You good hunter, but Frenzyheart can make you stronger. Harkek think maybe you ready for something more important. Before Rakjak send you on important mission, you need gather things for Rakjak. All along river to south are blue crystals. Rakjak need lots of blue crystals. You go get crystals now. "
591,Cultist Incursion,Speak to the Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids. ,<It appears the Avatar of Freya was right.  The undead were not able to enter Sholazar Basin before the Lifeblood Pillar was brought down -- they used their living agents from the Cult of the Damned instead. ><You'd best warn her about the Lich King's living agents within Sholazar Basin. >
592,Freya's Pact,Listen to what the Avatar of Freya has to say. ,"The cultists have been taken care of, but the Scourge's invasion has not slowed down.  The situation is becoming desperate, <name>. There exists a last resort.  Before I reveal any more, however, I must be sure I have your absolute trust. "
593,A Steak Fit for a Hunter,Bring 5 Longneck Grazer Steaks to Korg the Cleaver at the Nesingwary Base Camp. ,"Sometimes, there's nothing worse than a camp full of hunters. They're all so busy taking down prey animals that the only meat I get is tough and stringy. That's hardly the kind of thing you want to come home to after a long day on the hunt. Lucky for us, though, there is a source of tender, succulent meat nearby. To the south of the river and the camp live longneck grazers. They're a perfect source of meat for our hungry hunters. Bring me back the best cuts of meat and we'll properly toast our comrades. "
594,Frenzyheart Champion,I know you weren't traitor thing like others said. ,"I know you weren't traitor thing like others said. We hunt together. . . I know you better than all of them. Thank you for saving me. May sound funny. . . I not a big fan of big-tongues. . . but even I feel little bad for big-tongue dying like that though. . . they fight good enough they deserve fair fight. You want to be friends with Frenzyheart again? I think I can convince them that you save me and got the big-tongues good. I no want you to make me look dumb though, so you sure no more big-tongues for you? "
595,Song of Fecundity,"Soo-nee at Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to go to the Stormwright's Shelf, northwest of the Maker's Perch, and play the Horn of Fecundity near 8 piles Soaked Fertile Dirt. ","The storm is a destructive force.  Storm burns trees.  Storm floods houses. But storm can also be life force if you know right song.  In Stormwright Shelf, above Maker's Perch, you can find small dirt mounds.  They very fertile -- they carry inside a strong seed.  All they wait for is the right song. You take this horn and play song for them. "
596,Return of the Lich Hunter,Return to Frenzyheart Hill and speak to Elder Harkek. ,"Okay, I going back to Frenzyheart Hill to make sure all Frenzyheart know what you done for wolvar and for Zepik. You great hunter and they dumb to think you not. Go back to hill and talk to Elder Harkek. . . I make sure he knows you not traitor before any other Frenzyheart. Thank you, Lich Hunter. "
597,Rhino Mastery: The Kill,Bring Farunn's Horn to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Base Camp. ,"Now that we know where to find Farunn, all that remains is the battle against the great beast. Are you ready to take on this rhino, <name>? For all the spirit's blustering, I'm certain it was telling the truth about the beast's strength. When you're ready to face him, head north past the Suntouched Pillar and look for Farunn on the northeast shore of the Bittertide Lake. It may even venture near the Glimmering Pillar. Bring back its horn to commemorate your kill. "
598,Rejek: First Blood,"Blood Rejek's Blade on the corpses of a Sapphire Hive Wasp, a Hardknuckle Charger, and 3 members of the Mistwhisper Tribe. ","Rejek just became youngest warrior in all of Frenzyheart tribe. Father gave Rejek a mighty sword to defeat Frenzyheart enemies, but old tradition say sword need to be blooded first. Older warrior usually do that. You do this honor for Rejek? Take blade, put in corpses of all Frenzyheart foes: wasps and hardknuckles to southwest, and the big-tongues. Maybe blood blade on Mistwhispers, far to northwest near Bittertide Lake. "
599,Dreadsaber Mastery: Stalking the Prey,Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to identify 3 Shango Tracks from the Dreadsaber Tracks near Bittertide Lake. ,"I have heard that the natives tell stories of a large dreadsaber they call Shango. I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp. If you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. Debaar said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints. "
600,Weapons of Destruction,The Avatar of Freya wants you to go to the Death's Hand Encampment to the northwest and destroy 4 Unstable Explosives. ,The Lich King's lackeys have dared to bring weapons of destruction into my domain.  I will not stand for this. Go to their outpost to the north and destroy the weapons they would use against the land.  We cannot let the Scourge taint another inch of these sacred lands. 
601,Rhino Mastery: The Chase,Speak to Oracle Soo-rahm at the Bones of Nozronn. ,"Well, that's settled then. We'll seek out this native sage and have a word with him. He's not likely to volunteer his services, though. I'm told he keeps a small lean-to near the Bones of Nozronn, just across the river to the south. Seek him out, introduce yourself, and ask what he requires to help us track down this patriarch of the rhinos. "
602,Exterminate the Intruders,The Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids wants you to go to the Death's Hand Encampment to the northwest and slay 8 Cultist Infiltrators. ,"I am an embodiment of but one aspect of Freya, daughter of the titans.  I am the Lifewarden -- I was left here to protect this land against the threat of the Scourge. I never anticipated the Lich King would send willing living servants to do his work. I could easily crush these cultists myself, but I am all that stands between the undead armies and the rest of the basin.  Go, <name>.  Deliver my wrath to these insolent trespassers. "
603,Aerial Surveillance,Professor Calvert wants you to take the flight to Lakeside Landing and speak with Pilot Vic there. ,"You did a good job helping Wes with getting that flying machine back up and running. If you'd like to help us further, there is an unusual weather pattern coming in from the northeast.  I have a pilot ready to work for me, but I'm afraid he needs a copilot. If you think you're up to it, you can take the flight to Lakeside Landing.  Tell Vic I sent you. "
604,Forced Hand,Kill 8 Frenzyheart Spearbearers and 6 Frenzyheart Scavengers for Mistcaller Soo-gan at Mistwhisper Refuge. ,"We try to be nice to puppy-men ever since they came, but they nothing but mean. We okay with them being dumb - they not do much harm. Now they mess with sacred shrines though. Sacred shrines not for messing with. The Great Stones are here from all the way back when the Great Ones made us. We wouldn't know what to do if the Great Mist Stone were hurt. Go to their camp to north. . . make puppy-men stop and not come back! "
605,My Pet Roc,Bring 7 Roc Eggs to Zootfizzle at Dorian's Outpost. ,"Dorian's had me training and feeding the baby drakes he captures, and it has gotten me thinking. I want a pet of my own! No, not a juvenile drake. I don't want a pet capable of biting my hand off! However, in the Bonefields to the northeast of the camp, beyond the area dominated by the drakes, there's a large population of goretalon rocs. The grown ones are beyond hope of domesticating, but if you bring me the eggs from their nests, I can raise them from the time they hatch. "
606,Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial,Kill 15 Mangal Crocolisks and return to Debaar at the Nesingwary Encampment. ,"I warn you, stranger -- do not make any comments about crashing the ship. I already get enough of it from the rest of the expedition. If you're looking to try your hand at hunting, though, you should test your skills against the wily mangal crocolisks. They live all along the river to the south, and in the Wildgrowth Mangal to the east. Prove you can hold your own against them and we'll talk again, hunter. "
607,In Search of Bigger Game,Talk to &lt; x&gt; at &lt; x&gt; . ,"Well, <name>, you've been an enormous asset to the expedition so far. Debaar, Buck, and I couldn't have have assembled such an amazing collection of trophies without you. But, I hear there are even fiercer monsters in other parts of the basin. I've sent a search party up north to get an idea of what other beasts await us. I'd like you to meet up with them and see what they've found. Head north, beyond Bittertide Lake and search for the encampment. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(12586))"
608,Home Time! ,Return to Rainspeaker Canopy. ,"You're a good dryskin. Mistwhisper safe, treasure safe, and puppy-men sure to leave us alone now. You go back to Rainspeaker Canopy and tell Soo-say you done good. "
609,Crocolisk Mastery: The Plan,Bring 5 Sandfern fronds to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp. ,"The mangal crocolisk is a master of the ambush, and I intend to beat the best at his game. To do that, we'll need to construct a convincing camouflage for you. We'll use plants that grow in the sandy soil of the riverbanks and lake beaches. The sandfern is best for this purpose. It grows in the sandy areas near the shores of the Seabreach Flow, just to the south, Bittertide Lake and Bittertide Falls, to the north, and the edges of River's Heart, the large lake beyond the mangal to the east. "
610,Sharpening Your Talons,Kill 6 Primordial Drakes and then speak with Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost. ,"The primordial drakes occupy most of the area to the north and east, and I can feel the heat of their breath even at this distance. Before we can challenge the mightiest among the drakes, we must test our skills against the lesser creatures. Still, don't let your guard down; any one of these beasts can devour a man whole. Once you've familiarized yourself with the combat tactics of these drakes, return and I will tell you our next step. "
611,An Offering for Soo-rahm,"Bring 5 Intact Cobra Fangs to Oracle Soo-rahm, near the Bones of Nozronn. ","We not know you, stranger, but we know you want something. We will talk to Bones of Nozronn for you, but you must bring us offerings. We need powerful emperor cobra fangs to complete our oracle's necklace. Go to the Wildgrowth Mangal, northeast of our hut, find cobras and bring back best fangs. Then we make bones speak to you. "
612,The Bones of Nozronn,"Use Soo-rahm's Incense near the Bones of Nozronn, then return to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Base Camp with the information you learned. ","Bones of Nozronn, Oracle Soo-rahm sends <name> to you! We have prepared incense for you. Light it and place it near Nozronn's head and you will hear his voice. <Confused, you tell Soo-rahm that you haven't even told him your question. >True, we not know, but mighty Nozronn does. Do not doubt. Nozronn will answer your heart's question. Go. Nozronn not wait long. "
613,Aerial Surveillance,Professor Calvert wants you to take the flight to Lakeside Landing and speak with Pilot Vic there. ,"You did a good job helping Wes with getting that flying machine back up and running. If you'd like to help us further, there is an unusual weather pattern coming in from the northwest.  I have a pilot ready to work for me, but I'm afraid he needs a copilot. If you think you're up to it, you can take the flight to Lakeside Landing.  Tell Vic I sent you. "
614,PvP Test,Kill 10 opponents. ,"Kill me some guys from the other side!  Those guys suck!  I need to test something, so let's just repeat this over and over again.  I need to test something, so let's just repeat this over and over again.  I need to test something, so let's just repeat this over and over again.  I need to test something, so let's just repeat this over and over again.  I need to test something, so let's just repeat this over and over again.  I need to test something, so let's just repeat this over and over again. "
615,Reagent Agent,Bring 5 Twisted Roc Claws to Colvin Norrington at Dorian's Outpost. ,"That Archmage Pentarus, back in Dalaran, will be expecting us to return with all kinds of reagents and talismans. It seems the locals are fond of animal parts. Twisted claws from the goretalon rocs are among their favorite. It's not my place to say whether the rumors are true or not, but I've a feeling there's something here. The rocs live in the Bonefields off to the northeast, where they feed on the corpses of old mammoths. Will you help me gather talons for the archmage's research? "
616,They Took Our Men! ,Gretchen Fizzlespark wants you to go to Sifreldar Village and rescue 5 Goblin Prisoners. ,"You have to help us!  We were in the middle of an expedition into the mountains to set up a transmission tower when we were attacked. They looked like vrykul, except their skin was blue and layered with frost. . . and they were all female!  They took all the men in the expedition and let us women go.  Please, <name>!  We think they're being held in Sifreldar, the village overlooking K3. "
617,Forging an Alliance,You are to go to Dun Niffelem and ask King Jokkum to allow Thorim's armor to be reforged. ,"< Thorim, for the first time since your meeting him, smiles. >This is all beginning to have the smell of fate's hand, <race>. Your discovery is what remains of my armor, long ago cast off in a fit of grief and left to the elements. Only the sons of Hodir are capable of its reforging, for they are its original creators. Perhaps you've done enough to soften their hatred of me. Seek out their king, Jokkum, if he still breathes. Find your way into his good graces and plead for his assistance. "
618,Mending Fences,"Thorim at the Temple of Storms wants you to Kill Fjorn and 5 Stormforged Iron Giants at Fjorn's Anvil, east of Dun Niffelem. ","If I hope to wrest control of the Temple of the Makers from my brother, I must make amends with my old allies. Perhaps by eliminating a common enemy, we may at least take a step towards renewing my friendship with the frost giants. Fjorn has besieged Dun Niffelem with giants of iron. You must defeat him at Fjorn 's Anvil, far to the east of here, and weaken his forces sufficiently for the Sons of Hodir to emerge victorious. Take this charm, <name>. Use it to summon my earthen to your aid. "
619,The Prototype Console,Interact with the Prototype Console in The Inventor's Library. ,Designation SCRAP-E. Directive: Maintain consoles and databases of Inventor's Library in Keeper Mimir's absences. Time since last maintenance cycle: 489 days. Status of schematic data: unknown.

621,A Spark of Hope,You are to bring the Refined Gleaming Ore to Thorim in the Temple of Storms. ,"Clearly, this is more than an ordinary hunk of metal. Unlike any ore you're familiar with, it is hard but not brittle, far lighter than it looks, and glows even when cool. Looking closer, you can make out one of Thorim 's runes shining beneath the surface. . . . "
622,Everfrost,You are to return to Dun Niffelem and ask Calder about the piece of Everfrost. ,"This piece of ice has been submitted to immense pressures and exposed to natural magics from deep beneath the world's surface. In combination, these effects have yielded an ice that will never melt. Knowing little of these things, you resolve to bring the sample back to Dun Niffelem. Someone there is bound to be familiar with its properties. "
623,Cold Hearted,"Brijana, just east of Brunnhildar Village, wants you to fly to Dun Niffelem, then free 3 Captured Proto-Drakes and rescue 9 Brunnhildar Prisoners. ","To be slain honorably on the field of battle brings us all glory. To be frozen in a block of ice and endlessly taunted does not. . . . You are to fly to the frost giant city of Dun Niffelem, just east of the Valley of Ancient Winters, and liberate a captive proto-drake. With her, you will be able to free our sisters from their frozen bonds and carry three of them safely home. Beware the giants' clubs, sister, lest you find yourself numbered among the captives. "
624,The Refiner's Fire,You must collect 10 Furious Sparks from the Seething Revenants at Frostfield Lake and then use the anvil at Fjorn's Anvil. ,"Beneath its porous exterior, this hunk of metal gleams with a mysterious quality. You feel it would only be prudent to burn off the slag at Fjorn's Anvil. As you ponder where in this frozen waste you might find something hot enough for the job, a fire revenant crosses your path. . . "
625,How To Slay Your Dragon,You are to use Hodir's Spear to challenge a Wild Wyrm in the Valley of Ancient Winters. ,"Hodir's Spear is an icon of great prowess in battle. Its mere presence instills a deep hunger for glory in all who enter Dun Niffelem. In fact, simply being near it has compelled you to test your own abilities. Scanning the horizon, your vision locks on a wild wyrm as it flies nearby. It is decided. Of you and he, only one shall see the next sunrise. . . . "
626,Making a Harness,Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to obtain 3 Icemane Yeti Hides. ,"So you want to ride?  Well, if you've made it this far someone must think you've got a shot at the Hyldsmeet. First things first; we'll have to make you a harness. In the cliffs to the south, you'll find scattered groups of yeti.  Their hides are tough and just the right thickness.  Bring me some and we'll get you started on the path of the bear-rider. "
627,The Drakkensryd,Use the Hyldnir Harpoon to defeat 10 Hyldsmeet Drakeriders at the Temple of Storms. ,"This is it.  You've passed all the tests of the Hyldsmeet. . . all but one.  You've risen among our sisters' best and fiercest. The final test is at hand.  The Drakkensryd - the true test of a Hyldnir's worth and warrior spirit.  It'll be you, your riding drake, a chained harpoon and a score of your sisters vying for dominance. Show no quarter.  None will be expected. "
628,The Iron Colossus,Use a Tamed Jormungar to defeat the Iron Colossus and return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge. ,"We have failed to prevent the completion of the iron colossus, <name>, which means we have no choice but to face it in battle. Bruor has devised a plan to exploit the colossus' only weakness. No matter how tough the colossus' armor is, it is still vulnerable to a jormungar's acid. Take control of one using the orbs along the northern edge of the Snowdrift Plains, then use it to fight the iron colossus on the Snowdrift Plains. If you need help controlling the creature, speak to one of the nearby handlers. "
629,SCRAP-E,Bring the SCRAP-E Access Card along with 4 Handfuls of Cobalt Bolts and 5 Overcharged Capacitors to SCRAP-E at The Inventor's Library. ,"This card allows the user to access the control panel of the scrapbot designated SCRAP-E, in order to perform maintenance and reprogram the bot's directives. SCRAP-E appears to be assigned to the interior of the building at The Inventor's Library. The card displays a list of the bot's broken components and failing systems. With the proper parts, the bot can be restored to working condition. "
630,Ample Inspiration,Ricket at K3 wants you to retrieve a U. ,"Wow! That stuff is nasty. Not to account for gnoll taste or anything, but I figured whatever they had would at least be. . . edible? Let's get more creative. Tore's got an explosive dispenser north of town. . . not far from the big cavern entrance, can't miss it. I'm sure she intends them for mining purposes of some sort, but I've got a better idea. Grab one of those things and rush it to one of the nearby mammoths. . . most of them are to the west. Collect the meat, bring it back. "
631,The Last of Her Kind,Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to rescue an Icemaw Matriarch in the Hibernal Cavern. ,"For as long as I can remember, we've obtained our best bears from the Hibernal Cave to the east. Those times might finally be gone.  The cave has been overrun by ravenous jormungar and the wild bears are all but extinct. If you were to find a surviving matriarch, however, I would guarantee you that she would fight better than any of these bears born in captivity. Take this harness to the Hibernal Cave and rescue a surviving matriarch.  Good luck finding one. "
632,Placing Hodir's Helm,Njormeld wants you to fly to the tip of the northern ice spike in Dun Niffelem and use the Tablets of Pronouncement. ,"The helm is forged. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, small one. Though there remains much to do, we sons of Hodir are grateful for your accomplishments. In return, I offer you the opportunity to present Hodir's helm to our king and our brethren. Fly to the sparkling tip of the small ice spike in front of me and read to our people from this tablet. Enjoy the privilege, <class>. Never before has an outsider been given such an honor! "
633,Cell Block Tango,Ricket at K3 would like you to locate the Transporter Power Cell and use it to activate the Transportation Pad at Garm's Rise. ,"The sapper squad is ready. That means it's time for fun! There's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on Garm! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind him--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet. . . which means the power cell didn't get there. I need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter. "
634,The Warm-Up,Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch to defeat Kirgaraak. ,"You've been very fortunate, sister.  This is a matriarch the likes of which hasn't been seen in years. A good bear won't do you much good without the skill to ride it. I'm going to have you practice some moves on Kirgaraak.  He's the largest yeti we've ever managed to capture so be careful.  Don't be afraid to walk away if he gives you a beating. . . there's a reason why we keep him chained. "
635,The Heart of the Storm,Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to travel to Uldis and try to prevent Overseer Narvir from obtaining the Heart of the Storm. ,"According to the documents you captured at Narvir's Cradle, the iron colossus is complete except for one key component -- the Heart of the Storm. Without it, the iron colossus' weapons would be much weaker than the design predicts. If we can deny Overseer Narvir the heart, we could defeat the colossus! Notes on the documents you found say that the heart is in Uldis, a titan facility far to the south. Its entrance is on the south side of a tall mountain overlooking the Bor's Breath River. "
636,The Crone's Bargain,Lok'lira the Crone inside the Forlorn Mine wants you to retrieve the Runes of the Yrkvinn from Overseer Syra. ,"Yes, it must be the little green prisoner you're after. . .  We might be able to help each other. You're not going to get the goblin out of here by force. Not alive, anyway. Among my people I am known as a Yrkvinn, a practitioner of illusions. As you can see, the Hyldnir have made me their prisoner. If I had my runes, I could make you go unnoticed among them. Further inside, patrolling the mines, you'll find an overseer named Syra. She has my runes. Retrieve them and we'll talk some more. "
637,Culling Jorcuttar,King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to slay Jorcuttar in Hibernal Cavern. ,"I have an opportunity that will help you to gain approval with my people, provided you prevail. The jormungar are a nuisance best dealt with quickly. If given any quarter, they breed like hares and spread like fire. They have appeared southwest of here, in the Hibernal Cavern. If their spawnmother is not slain soon, they will gain a foothold in our region. She cannot refuse food. Take this knife and get the flank of a bear corpse from their cave. Place it near her crater and kill her as she feeds. "
638,The Reckoning,Meet Thorim near the Temple of Wisdom. ,"Loken killed my wife, turned my followers and me against each other.  He took away everything I had, but today. . . that changes. Today we reclaim our sacred grounds.  Today. . . Loken dies. Meet me on the bridge near the Temple of Wisdom, just southwest of Ulduar.  I will finish this one way or the other. I need you there as a witness.  You will not aid me -- this is personal. After it's done, send word to Jokkum, King of the Frost Giants.  He's a good friend and will know what to do. "
639,Forging Hodir's Spear,Lorekeeper Randvir in Dun Niffelem wants you to collect 3 Everfrost Shards from the depths of Hibernal Cavern and 3 Stoic Mammoth Hides from the Stoic Mammoths in the Valley of Ancient Winters. ,"The time has come, little <class>. The stars have foretold of this day. I have received a vision from mighty Hodir himself, revealing the secret to the creation of a great artifact. We must obey! Were we to fail in receiving this gift, doom would surely follow. I call upon you to assist me in this sacred undertaking. Go across the valley, deep into the Hibernal Cavern and gather everfrost shards from the icy crater there, then collect hides from the mammoths outside the cavern. "
640,Sibling Rivalry,Thorim wants you to listen to his story. ,"Sif? Is it truly you? No? A <race>? But for a moment. . . . Enough of this! The visions of my Sif have tormented me for far too long. It is time for me to avenge her, and to bring honor to her memory. My brother must pay! "
641,"Krolmir, Hammer of Storms",Thorim wants you to talk to King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem and discover what he knows of Krolmir. ,"One task remains before I can reclaim my home at the Terrace of the Makers. Krolmir must be found. On that fateful day, I threw it to the earth with all the power and rage I possessed. A mighty explosion followed. I've thought it lost for these many years, but now I must be certain. Return to King Jokkum and discover what, if anything, he knows of my hammer's fate. "
642,Loyal Companions,Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to obtain 8 slabs of Fresh Ice Rhino Meat and use them to feed the Stormcrest Eagles above town. ,"Fresh blood! Good to meet ya! I've got some work if you've got some time. Off to the east are the Foot Steppes. . . pretty hard land, but there's quite a group of rhino that graze there. Our birds have a taste for that rhino meat, but it's always a bit dangerous for them to go hunting with all of the proto-drakes that nest around there. If you're keen, head over that way and get some rhino meat, bring it back to the peaks above here, and then use it to feed some of the eagles that nest there. "
643,Only Partly Forgotten,An Injured Goblin Miner in Crystalweb Cavern wants you to bring back an Icetip Venom Sac from an Icetip Crawler. ,"Oi. . . it's like there's a propeller in my stomach. I think I can walk, but I got something nasty in my system when I got bit by something in the back of the cave. It was bigger than the other spiders. . . and brightly colored. Ricket can probably make me an antidote, but she'd need the venom sac from whatever bit me. Would you mind finding it for me? I don't think Tore's coming. I'll just pretend I'm dead here and hopefully they'll leave me alone. "
644,Leave No Goblin Behind,Find the entrance to the Forlorn Mine in northern Sifreldar Village and look for clues for Zeev Fizzlespark's whereabouts. ,"All of our boys are back. . . thanks to you, <name>!  Well. . . all but one. My brother Zeev is still up there according to the others.  Apparently they have some sort of mine where they make their prisoners work.  Go in there and see if you can find out anything. "
645,Sniffing Out the Perpetrator,Use the Frosthound Collar at the Abandoned Camp to track down whoever took Brann's possessions. ,"The tone of Brann's note suggests he meant to bury something with the note, maybe a pack of some kind. You're sure this was all you found? Okay, I'm going to have you take one of these frosthounds with you. The frostborn use them for tracking. Bring it to the destroyed camp and let it get Brann's scent. It should at least lead you to the location of those missing possessions, and if we're lucky, Brann himself. "
646,A Flawless Plan,"Gino at Garm's Rise wants you to plant the Hardpacked Explosive Bundle near Frostgut's Altar, kill Tormar Frostgut, and then escape the cave before it collapses on you. ","Hey there! Joining us for the assault I assume? I've got a special task for you. . . we're going to bring the whole cave down on their heads! Towards the back of their cave, you should find Frostgut's Altar.  Sneak up and plant this hardpacked explosive bundle somewhere close to it. Once the charge is placed, stick around just long enough to make sure Frostgut bites it, then get out quickly! There's no knowing how long the cave will last once that thing goes off! "
647,The Brothers Bronzebeard,Accompany Brann Bronzebeard and his flying machine to Frosthold. ,"That does it! We finally have the keystone. . . It's beautiful! I've been around the world more than once, but this thing's got me all jittery with excitement again. I suppose now's not the time to stop and admire though, we need to get the heck out of here. Hop on my flying machine and help keep us covered from those iron dwarves on the way out! "
648,The Core's Keeper,Obtain Norgannon's Core. ,"Prospector Soren's notes say that Norgannon's Core is in the keeping of a sentinel named Athan, one of Mimir's creations. Soren says the vault where Athan resides is called ""Loken's Bargain"" these days. Loken, eh? The earthen have mentioned him. The vault is said to be southwest of the ruined Explorers' League camp, with a round entrance on a mountainside overlooking the Valley of Ancient Winters. Find this Athan and get the core from him, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were in for a fight. "
649,You'll Need a Bear,Speak to Brijana outside Brunnhildar Village. ,"You've succeeded in the first rounds of the Hyldsmeet.  To advance further, you're going to need a warbear of your own. Unfortunately, the Hyldnir don't give them out to just anyone.  You'll have to emerge victorious from true battle, not just gladiatorial combat. The Hyldnir of Brunnhildar are currently involved in a feud against the Sons of Hodir, Thorim's former allies.  Speak to Brijana just outside the village and see how you can help them and prove yourself in the process. "
650,Pieces to the Puzzle,Gather 6 Inventor's Disk Fragments and use them to assemble the Inventor's Disk. ,"Thank the Light that someone got my message. Now that I'm safe from the iron dwarves, I need to ask your help with something. I've got a lead on Norgannon's keystone, which guards access to Ulduar's archives, but the Titans divided it into two pieces and secreted them away. One of the pieces, the keystone's shell, is held within the Inventor's Library on the northern coast, south of Ulduar itself. The first thing you'll need to do is retrieve the fragments of an access disk from the library's guardians. "
651,You Can't Miss Him,King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to find Njormeld at Fjorn's Anvil. ,"<Jokkum listens patiently to your request, then ponders it carefully before responding. >So it is you we have to thank for Fjorn's demise? While it's true that you have aided us in our time of need, there is still much that must be done to repair our relations with Thorim. For now, I shall allow Njormeld to reforge the armor we gifted to the Stormlord so many ages ago. Consider it payment for your assistance against Fjorn. Njormeld was sent to recover Fjorn's anvil. You should find him there. "
652,Forging a Head,Njormeld in Dun Niffelem needs you to use the Diamond Tipped Pick on the Dead Iron Giants at Frostfield Lake and return to him when you have collected 8 Stormforged Eyes. ,"Greetings, <race>. I have a task that King Jokkum felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people. I have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant Hodir's blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect are the very eyes of our fallen enemies. Take this tool, and gather the eyes from the iron giant corpses that litter our fields. "
653,Back to the Pit,"Gretta the Arbiter, in Brunnhildar Village, wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch inside the Pit of the Fang and defeat 6 Hyldsmeet Warbears. ",To truly stay in your best riding shape you'll want to test yourself against the other Hyldnir every day. Head back into the Pit of the Fang and show them what you're capable of.  They'll appreciate suffering defeat to one as skilled as yourself. 
654,Hot and Cold,"You are to go to Frostfield Lake, kill the Brittle Revenants there and use the Essence of Ice on the Smoldering Scraps at Fjorn's Anvil. ","As you stare at the anvil you relive your recent accomplishments, particularly those which brought this artifact to rest here. It suddenly occurs to you that more remains to be done. To the east, smoldering scraps clutter the landscape--shrapnel from the battle fought there. If they could be cooled and gathered somehow, the frost giants would have an abundant supply of metal and the region would be cleared of these remnants of war. "
655,Loken's Lackeys,Thorim wants you to slay Eisenfaust inside the Hall of the Shaper and Halefnir the Windborn and Duronn the Runeforged in the Terrace of the Makers. ,"The attack on the Terrace of the Makers was not a half-hearted move on my brother's behalf.  He sent a legion of iron dwarves and some of his most powerful lieutenants. Use the Horn of the Peaks to call the earthen to your side and defeat Loken's servants. You'll find the giant, Eisenfaust, inside the Hall of the Shaper to the north.  You'll find the others deeper inside the Terrace of the Makers, beyond the stairs to the northwest. "
656,Sirana Iceshriek,Glorthal Stiffbeard at Frosthold wants you to kill Sirana Iceshriek. ,"This Sirana Iceshriek sounds like the one that's spurring the harpies to be more aggressive. If we kill her, I suspect their attacks won't last long afterwards. One of our stormriders claims to have spotted her circling the peak directly northwest of here.  Go find the wench and put her down. Let's see this done. "
657,The Lonesome Watcher,Recover Frostgrip's Signet Ring from an Iron Dwarf Monitor and then bring it to Creteus in the Foot Steppes. ,"I never found the core. . . but I've often spoken to the keeper Creteus, and his omissions give him away. You'll find Creteus over the mountains to the east, in the Foot Steppes, keeping watch on the Engine of the Makers. The core might well be in there, but you'll need to win Creteus 's favor. The iron dwarves were here looking for something. . . it might well be the core. They took my ring. Find their leader, get the ring back, and show it to Creteus so that he knows I sent you. "
658,The Earthen Oath,"Thorim, at the Terrace of the Makers, wants you to use the Horn of the Peaks and call on the Earthen to defeat 20 Iron Dwarves and 7 Iron Sentinels. ","For years I neglected my duties, giving into defeat and self-pity. Not the brave earthen, however.  Their oath to protect these grounds with their lives has gone unbroken. Even now, they fight the corruption of iron with selflessness, waiting for the moment in which the tides turn. That moment has arrived.  We must rally what remains of the earthen defenders and lead them into a glorious victory.  Sound the Horn of the Peaks to call them to your side and take back the Terrace of the Makers. "
659,Battling the Elements,Njormeld wants you to accompany Snorri to Fjorn's anvil and help him kill 10 Seething Revenants. ,"Snorri was once the pride of our nation. A mighty warrior, many an enemy fell to his club. We honor him, though he's no longer what he once was. Age has taken its toll, dulling his senses and sapping his strength. Still, he remains as proud as ever, never missing an opportunity to join a battle. Speaking of battle, we're cooling Fjorn's anvil so it can be taken home. The remaining fire revenants are putting up some resistance. Help Snorri relive his glory days, <race>. Guide him against this enemy. "
660,The Terrace of the Makers,"Find Thorim at the southeastern edge of the Terrace of the Makers, just northwest of Dun Niffelem. ","It is time, <name>.  I am prepared to face Loken now. Let us make our way to the Terrace of the Makers and face my brother's forces.  The fool will regret ever crossing me. "
661,The Hidden Relic,Creteus in the Foot Steppes has provided you with the information to locate Norgannon's Core. ,"During your absence, I was privileged enough to parley with the dwarf Brann Bronzebeard. This dwarf indicated his purpose for seeking the keystone, and I am satisfied that it is for satisfactory intent. . . I believe this dwarf may be the entity for which the keystone was created. Norgannon's Core is located in the Frigid Tomb to the southeast. Its guardians are ancient beings of ice, and they will not welcome your presence. Best these guardians and retrieve the keystone with my blessing, <race>. "
662,Missing Scouts,Glorthal in Frosthold has requested a search of the Bor's Breath valley and Bor's Fall for any sign of the missing Frostborn Scouts. ,"There is something that I could use a hand with now that I have you. We have a few scouts that are extremely late in returning. The peaks are harsh. . . but these boys know what they're doing. Head to the east. . . along the Bor's Breath valley and near Bor's Fall. . . they should be out that direction. If you find any sign of one of them, bring me back news immediately. We have a few enemies in the area - if any of them are getting a bit uppity, the more warning the better. "
663,Slaves of the Stormforged,Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to free 6 Captive Mechagnomes and kill 3 Stormforged Taskmasters. ,"To the southwest, on the western side of the Snowdrift Plains, the iron dwarves have dug a mine into the hillside. There, they use captive mechagnomes, servants of Keeper Mimir, to mine ore. I don't know where these mechagnomes came from, nor what they would do with their freedom, but perhaps we can win their help. Go to the Frozen Mine, <name>, and set these creatures free from their bondage. Ask if they would fight alongside us against iron dwarf tyranny. "
664,Ancient Relics,Return 10 Relics of Ulduar to Rork Sharpchin in Frosthold. ,"Why hello thar! Before you be headin' off to do your grand questin' and adventure, might I beg a wee favor of ya, <lad/lass>? These mountains be packed full'a precious relics and baubles. . . this place be a dream come true for tha league. I'd be much obliged if ya could bring any such treasures you stumble upon back ta me. You can even share in me ale for tha trouble! Trust me <lad/lass>, that's a rich deal! "
665,Examples to be Made,Mildred the Cruel at the Forlorn Mine wants you to slay Garhal. ,"For every action there is an opposite reaction, sister.  In the case of us applying pressure on the males, this has meant newly spread rumors of insurrection. The bearded pig behind this rabble-rousing is called Garhal.  Put an end to him. . . and make sure the other males see his demise.  They must learn that insubordination will not be tolerated. "
666,Deemed Worthy,Brijana wants you to go to Brunnhildar Village and speak with Astrid Bjornrittar. ,"You have succeeded where many have failed, sister. Whether it be by strength and courage or mere luck remains to be seen. Go back to the village and seek out Astrid Bjornrittar. Tell her of your accomplishments. But be warned. She is not easily impressed. "
667,The Master Explorer,Bring Norgannon's Core to Brann Bronzebeard in the Engine of the Makers. ,"Combining the keystone will require Norgannon's Binding - a device located in the Engine of the Makers, the large pit beside us. Brann should be down there with the other half of the keystone now. I have instructed him on the use of the device. He awaits your presence. I will do what I can to keep the iron dwarves occupied, but I do not have confidence that I will hold them for long. King Stormheart is returning to the defense of Frosthold with some of his men shortly. Please hurry, <race>. "
668,A Monument to the Fallen,King Jokkum wants you to bring Hodir's Horn Fragments to Njormeld in Dun Niffelem. ,"Bring these fragments to Njormeld. He will use the pieces of that sacred relic in the construction of a mighty monument. May it soothe the pains and heal the scars my people have borne these many years. May its presence help to bring about a new age that sees us once again in glorious battle at Thorim's side. Go now, <class>. Njormeld awaits you. "
669,The Armor's Secrets,Take the Dark Armor Plate to Mimir's Workshop and ask Attendant Tock to examine it. ,"The presence of that armor plate is disorienting, but we need to find out all we can from it. It could be part of one of Valduran's schemes. He's dedicated an extraordinary amount of effort to mining, refining, smithing, and testing this metal. To the east, along the northern mountain face, is a building called Mimir's Workshop. It hasn't been used in quite some time, but if we're lucky, some of its attendants are still functional. Take your armor plate there and learn what you can from it. "
670,Veranus,"Thorim, at the Temple of Storms, wants you to obtain 5 Small Proto-Drake Eggs from the peaks near Brunnhildar Village. ","If I'm to launch an attack against my brother's army, I'm going to need some way to get around. I released my riding drake back into the wild years ago.  Veranus was magnificent.  The leader of her own brood -- to whom she has now returned. Finding her will be hard, but perhaps there's a way.  She keeps her old empty nest out of pure pride.  She's a broodmother in name only, for she is beyond the age of breeding. Bring me small eggs from the other nests near Brunnhildar.  I think I've an idea. "
671,Territorial Trespass,Place the Stolen Proto-Dragon Eggs on top of the Broodmother's Nest and return to Thorim at the Temple of Storms. ,"Veranus is proud like no other beast I've known.  She still keeps her old nest and makes sure none of the younger proto-drakes takes it over. Take the eggs you've collected and place them on her nest.  You'll find it atop a small peak, directly southeast of here. I should be able to get control of her before she kills you in a fit of rage.  Hopefully. "
672,The Scrapbot Construction Kit,Interact with the Prototype Console in The Inventor's Library. ,"Searching the databanks of the prototype console reveals schematics for a scrapbot construction kit. With your engineering expertise, you could learn this schematic and produce scrapbot construction kits of your own. "
673,Ancient Relics,Return 10 Relics of Ulduar to Olut Alegut at the Grom'arsh Crash-site. ,"Welcome to the peaks. I have a simple request before you head off on whatever grand jaunt you have planned. There are relics and treasures of ancient Ulduar scattered through these mountains. Most are likely in possession of the various sentient races. Return any that you find to me, and I will reward you in kind. Perhaps I'll even let you partake on my many potent ales. "
674,Rare Earth,Use the Earthen Mining Pick to mine 7 clumps of Enchanted Earth. ,"It seems so long ago that these hammers pounded and hewed stone instead of iron. Our expulsion from Ulduar saw the weakest of us dead and the strongest of our craftsmen reborn as warriors. As the irons beat us back, even the strongest find themselves failing. We can do little for the wounded, save when we have a stock of enchanted earth. We used to mine it from the deposits on the sheer cliff face to the northwest, but the constant battle has prevented us from replenishing our stock. Would you help? "
675,Going After the Core,Find Prospector Khrona's Notes and Prospector Soren's Maps at Brann's Base-Camp. ,"With Norgannon's Shell in hand, only half of the archive key remains to be found. Luckily, I've had the Explorers' League hard at work chasing down leads about the whereabouts of Norgannon's Core. Far to the southeast of the Inventor's Library, on the slopes to the north of Dun Niffelem, is a camp bearing my name. The Explorers' League representatives seeking the second half of the key are based there. Bring me the maps and the notes they've made and we should be able to track down the other key half. "
676,Valduran the Stormborn,Use Bouldercrag's War Horn when you have found Valduran the Stormborn. ,"We have no choice, <name>. What you learned in Mimir's Workshop means that we must act before Valduran can complete and unleash his new weapon. Even now, the refuge's defenders fight to buy us time to deal with Valduran the Stormborn. You must go to Nidavelir, across the Snowdrift Plains to the southwest, and then find and face Valduran. But you will not be alone. Bring this war horn with you and sound it as you prepare to face the leader of our enemies. Bruor and I will aid you in this battle. "
677,Armor of Darkness,Bring 4 Dark Armor Samples to Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge. ,This armor plate is thick and oversized compared to the rest of the golem's defenses. A quick examination of the golem's corpse reveals that this heavier plate seems to have been bolted on as an afterthought or a crude upgrade. Why would the iron dwarves have added this redundant and mismatched armor to their war golems? Perhaps Bruor Ironbane would know if he had the chance to examine several of these plates from stormforged war golems. 
678,The Aberrations Must Die,Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village wants you to go to Valkyrion and obtain Vials of Frost Oil from the Valkyrion Aspirants. ,"It is not enough to demonstrate your prowess among your peers.  You must also fight our enemies, dear sister. The Valkyrion traitors continue to mock our noble drake-riding traditions by rearing plagued proto-drakes. Seize the frost oil they wield and use it to freeze their abominable plagued eggs. "
679,Valkyrion Must Burn,Use the Valkyrion Harpoon Guns to burn 6 Dry Haystacks. ,The crate is filled with incendiary harpoons.  You recall seeing harpoon guns and dry stacks of hay outside. Perhaps Iva will appreciate the extra effort and reward you appropriately. 
680,Into the Pit,"Astrid Bjornrittar, in Brunnhildar Village, wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch inside the Pit of the Fang and defeat 6 Hyldsmeet Warbears. ","Besting a tethered opponent is one thing.  Fighting other bear riders on equal footing is another. Head into the Pit of the Fang and use what you've learned to defeat your opponents.  Good luck, sister. Glory awaits, should you succeed. "
681,The Slithering Darkness,Astrid Bjornrittar wants you to slay 8 Ravenous Jormungar in the Hibernal Cavern east of Brunnhildar Village. ,"The vile jormungar have taken over most of the Hibernal Cavern.  They are despicable beings. . . children of Loken, Thorim's scumsucker of a brother. As Thorim's servants we owe it to ourselves to kill these scum where we find them.  You'll find the cavern just east of here, outside the village. "
682,Feeding Arngrim,"You are to feed Arngrim 5 Disembodied Jormungar, then return to Arngrim's frozen image in Dun Niffelem. ","Arngrim's hunger was legendary. Even in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl. It is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king. No sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand. "
683,Is That Your Goblin? ,Challenge Agnetta Tyrsdottar in order to save Zeev Fizzlespark. ,"I trust that's the green little one you've been looking for.  If I were you I'd step in before that Hyldnir splits him in half. You've arrived in the middle of the Hyldsmeet, so all challenges must be accepted by participants.  There's nothing to stop you from taking your green friend's place. "
684,Defending Your Title,Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village wants you to defeat 6 Victorious Challengers. ,"Everyone's impressed by your performance, sister.  But do not let your guard down -- every new challenger with delusions of grandeur is going to come out swinging for your title of Hyldskvinnar. Show these upstarts what you're made of. "
685,Changing the Wind's Course,Use the Lorehammer to travel back in time and face the North Wind as Stormhoof. ,"At last, we have all that we need to right the wrongs of the North Wind and its followers. You have attuned the Lorehammer to Stormhoof's time and his persona. Take the hammer again, head to the Temple of Life in the plains to the northwest. Use the hammer to assume the role of Stormhoof. Face the North Wind as Stormhoof, but realize that for the timeline to be restored, Stormhoof must die as the North Wind weakens. Then, you must find and use the Horn of Elemental Fury to destroy the North Wind. "
686,In Memoriam,King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to collect 8 Horn Fragments from Thunderfall. ,"Surely Thorim has told you of the tragedy that divides us. It was in Thunderfall, northeast of here, that these events unfolded. The frozen fossils there are a reminder of that dark day, as are the spirits that haunt that place. If my people are to forgive Thorim, something must take the place of those images. A memorial must be constructed to bring our hearts peace. Go there, <race>. Collect the fragments of Hodir's Horn that was shattered that day. "
687,On Brann's Trail,Retrieve the Burlap-Wrapped Note from Brann's camp and return it to Archaeologist Andorin at Frosthold. ,"After the discovery of Brann's journal in Grizzly Hills, we've only had one other communication from Brann. A mysterious note found its way to Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge, with no indication of where it came from. All it said was that we're to meet Brann at his camp and help him with his search. From what I can tell, the camp should be located northeast of here, across the Bor's Breath River and at the foot of some ruins from the Path of the Titans. "
688,Bearly Hanging On,Brijana at Brunnhildar Village wants you to mount Icefang and shoot 7 Frostworgs and 15 Frost Giants in the Valley of Ancient Winters. ,"The test awaits, woman! Do you have the heart of a warrior queen? Or that of a sniveling seamstress? One taste of war and you'll know the answer. You might lie to your mother, your sisters, and even yourself, but the battlefield always exposes one's true nature. When you've made your preparations, mount Icefang and ride into battle. From her back, you must rain down a shower of death upon our enemy. "
689,Bitter Departure,Escort the Injured Goblin Miner out of Crystalweb Cavern and then speak to Ricket at K3. ,Oi - thank you! I thought for sure I'd just be a spider snack. Perhaps I'm speaking a bit soon though - let's get the heck out of here! Let me know as soon as you're ready to go. . . make it quick. 
690,Pushed Too Far,Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to ride with a Stormcrest Eagle and kill 16 Stormpeak Wyrms in the Foot Steppes. ,"You were there with Loken, weren't you? The iron dwarves captured Veranus, the brood mother of the proto-drakes. The drakes don't seem even a little bit happy about the situation. . . they've gotten very aggressive. They've pushed into stormcrest territory and the eagles have taken to an all out fight with them. It's time to return the favor. We're riding to the Foot Steppes and slaughtering them there. King Stormheart left this hammer to me - make good use and see to it that I get it back. "
691,A Change of Scenery,Reconvene with Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village. ,"Excellent.  There's an exit in the eastern end of the mine that leads to Brunnhildar Village.  Follow it and I'll meet you there. We must not be seen together so no one suspects you of aiding me.  I'll use my magic to disguise my appearance.  Do not worry, <race> -- we'll find your friend in no time. "
692,Hodir's Call,You are to defeat 5 Niffelem Forefathers and 5 Restless Frostborn at Thunderfall. ,"You have done a great service to the giants of Dun Niffelem. Without your aid, this monument would not exist. As you silently ponder its significance, feelings begin to flood your heart. The feelings fill your mind with thoughts and images. . . as well as a sense of urgency. The sensations fade and leave you with a knowledge of what you must do. The restless spirits at Thunderfall must be put to rest. As you set off, you find that your hands have been filled with an ethereal horn. "
693,Fate of the Titans,"Creteus in the Foot Steppes has requested that you travel to the Temple of Invention, the Temple of Winter, the Temple of Life, and the Temple of Order and utilize the databank to examine each area. ","Norgannon's Core is not at this location. I am not sure why you seek it, <race>, and I am equally unsure if you truly know the purpose of that which you seek. I would like you to aid me before I consider extending my assistance.  I have recently encountered knowledge of the watcher, Thorim. His seat of power is contested, and his fate remains to be seen. This troubles me, for I do not know of the other watchers. Utilize this databank to examine their temples to the northeast and return the knowledge to me. "
694,A New Beginning,Njormeld wants you to take the Reforged Armor to Thorim at the Temple of Storms. ,"It remains uncertain whether or not our people can ever rekindle the affection we once held for Thorim. May this armor, if nothing else, remind him of the days when we stood together in honor, invincible. "
695,Sniffing Out the Perpetrator,Mount Frostbite and ride her to the source of the scent from Brann's note. ,"Boktar can have his way this time, but I'll expect him to make it up to me. Don't look at me like that. Boktar may be in command, but no one tells a hunter what to do. 'Put that beast away, ' he says. 'Make it stop growling. 'All of a sudden he changes his mind when it suits him. Next time he complains, Frostbite'll just nip him a bit. Don't worry, she'll do an admirable job tracking your prey. After she locates her target, you're on your own to deal with iron dwarves, or Brann, or whatever you find. "
696,Remember Everfrost! ,"Have you discovered any more everfrost, little &lt; race&gt; ? A level 77 The Storm Peaks Quest. ","Well done, little <class>. Everfrost was once plentiful in this region. Over the ages, though, the jormungar devoured nearly all of it. It is now very rare and very precious to my people. As you roam these lands, keep a lookout for more pieces of everfrost. Return to me with any that you find and we will be most grateful. "
697,Norgannon's Shell,Recover Norgannon's Shell from Archivist Mechaton. ,"Charging inventor's disk. Disk charging completed. Preparing emergency protocol gamma. Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified. Please have a pleasant millennium. "
698,Fervor of the Frostborn,Yorg Stormheart at Frosthold has requested that you speak to Fjorlin Frostbrow to secure a ride and face your challenge. ,"I be more than willing ta lend my shelter and home ta travelers in need, but I'm nae too keen ta force my people inte yer affairs. I'll tell ye what. . . my people are warriors, straight and true. On the day a frostborn becomes a man, he has ta prove himself in battle. He has ta show us that he'll not let size hold'm back. Show me yer as strong and fierce as one of my men, and I'll have them lend ye an ear or a blade. Speak ta Fjorlin over by the cliff to the south there and he'll put ye ta the test. "
699,Aberrations,Thyra Kvinnshal in Brunnhildar Village wants you to go to Valkyrion and obtain Vials of Frost Oil from the Valkyrion Aspirants. ,"The Lich King sent emissaries to us on three different occasions.  All three were promptly dismembered. Our sisters in Valkyrion were not as dedicated to our traditions and accepted the Scourge's advances.  Now instead of capturing their drakes from the wild, they raise them from the blight and filth that the Scourge wallow in. Take the frost oil that the Valkyrion Hyldnir carry on them and use it to freeze any blighted eggs you find.  Rumors speak of a fetid pool of blight where the eggs are kept. "
700,An Experienced Guide,Locate Drom Frostgrip. ,"I don't know where this core is hiding, but ye knew that. I said I'd help though, and that I shall. There's a hermit by the name of Drom Frostgrip who lives in a cave north of here. . . down in tha valley. We've strayed away from the titans a bit ourselves being that there are so few about, but Drom's loyal to the old ways. . . he keeps an eye on their most precious places and speaks te the keeper Creteus often. Yer sure to find him in the back of his cave. . . tell'm I sent ye and he'll help ye. "
701,Forging the Keystone,Brann Bronzebeard wants you to meet him at the Temple of Invention and help him combine Norgannon's Shell and Norgannon's Core. ,"Aha! Here it is: the Temple of Invention, the seat of Keeper Mimir himself! Of course, that's where one would go to join the two parts of the key. According to the prospector's notes, the Temple of Invention is one of the highest points on the western side of the Terrace of the Makers. That means it should be roughly east of your Grom'arsh Crash Site. I'll meet you at the temple and we'll combine the parts together. "
702,A Colossal Threat,Retrieve the Colossus Attack Specs and Colossus Defense Specs and bring them to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge. ,"You've done an excellent job of delaying the work on the iron colossus, but I fear we've only made the stormforged more determined to complete the weapon. Even now, they're bringing in new laborers and the overseers push them to the limit. We may not be able to keep them from bringing the colossus online, after all. Return to Narvir's Cradle, to the south and find the documents detailing the colossus' offensive and defensive abilities. They should be near the tents and forges on the bottom level. "
703,Norgannon's Shell,Recover Norgannon's Shell from Archivist Mechaton. ,"Charging inventor's disk. Disk charging completed. Preparing emergency protocol gamma. Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified. Please have a pleasant millennium. "
704,Taking on All Challengers,Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village wants you to defeat 6 Victorious Challengers. ,"Let's get you started.  The good news is that by defeating Agnetta, you've earned yourself a spot in the next round of matches. The bad news is that all your opponents will also have defeated someone in the first round.  Do not expect pushovers. "
705,Aid from the Explorers' League,Take Norgannon's Shell to Lagnus at Frosthold. ,"Interesting. I don't see any locking mechanisms on the shell. That suggests to me that it may take more than just finding the other piece to combine the keystone. Take the shell back to the expedition leader, Lagnus, at Frosthold. Once he gets over his awe, he should be able to glean what the core looks like based on the shell, and maybe they can get the Frost Dwarves to help find it. I'm going to see if I can find out how to combine the two pieces. We'll catch up once we've both made some progress. "
706,Pieces of the Puzzle,Use Brann's Communicator to contact Brann Bronzebeard and find out what to do next. ,"We've seen the iron dwarves and their constructs making war on the creatures of stone that Brann calls the earthen, along with their giant allies. Contact him and aid him in any way you can, and remember that anything we can learn from his search may aid us in fighting against the iron dwarves and their master. "
707,The Hyldsmeet,Listen to Lok'lira the Crone's proposal. ,"Whether you've noticed or not, by defeating your first Hyldnir in hand-to-hand combat, you've entered the Hyldsmeet -- the great competition of Hyldnir against Hyldnir to determine who will rule by Thorim's side. The Hyldsmeet is the reason why I was imprisoned, for I sought to partake in the competition but was far too old and frail to be a match for the Hyldnir. If you're willing to listen, I've a proposal for you. "
708,Discipline,Mildred the Cruel at the Forlorn Mine wants you to use the Disciplining Rod on 6 Exhausted Vrykul. ,"Let's start you off with something straightforward.  The male vrykul that work the mines for us do so against their will. . . purely out of fear of our blades. Once in a while, one of them will lose their motivation.  Find any uncooperative vrykul and put them in their place. Take this disciplining rod.  You'll want to inflict pain, not death.  Well, most of the time anyway. "
709,Mildred the Cruel,Speak to Mildred the Cruel inside the Forlorn Mine. ,"Our deal is made then, <name>.  You help me get out of these chains and I'll help you find your little green friend. The Hyldnir who runs this mine is known as Mildred the Cruel -- and with good reason. Tell her you've been sent to lend a hand with the mines.  Do whatever she asks until she trusts you with the keys to my shackles. "
710,Lok'lira's Parting Gift,Speak to Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village. ,"You've been a great ally, <name>.  Now comes your true test.  You will need skill, courage and a little luck. <Lok'lira attaches a thin strand of hair to yours. >You cannot fail now sister.  Speak to Gretta the Arbiter.  She'll see you on your way. "
711,Destroy the Forges! ,"Destroy the North Lightning Forge, the Central Lightning Forge, and the South Lightning Forge with Bouldercrag's Bombs, then return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge. ","In my folly, I'd thought Valduran's project at Narvir's Cradle, a large construction area to the south, no more than a grotesque monument to ""Keeper"" Loken's cruelty. Now we know the truth, that it was meant to be used as a weapon against us and our allies. We must not allow this iron colossus to reach completion, <name>, for it will mean the end of the refuge. Go to Narvir's Cradle, find the lightning forges the stormforged artisans use, and sabotage them. "
712,Looking for Survivors,Help Zak Wobblesprocket complete the Test Flight. ,"Gretchen Fizzlespark wants to use my flying machine to look for survivors from her expedition.  Apparently she thinks they're being held prisoner in the village to the north. The only problem is I don't have a co-pilot.  If you're willing to take it on, I'd be more than happy to teach you a move or two. What do you say, <name>?  Deal? "
713,Ore Repossession,Tore Rumblewrench outside of Crystalweb Cavern would like you to retrieve 5 samples of Impure Saronite Ore. ,"We're moving in! There were some snobolds here when we arrived. . . their mining operation seems to have met some unfortunate happenings though. Doesn't much matter - we were taking over soon anyway. I sent some of our miners in there to get me some ore samples that I can use to calibrate our machines for processing, but they haven't come back. Mind going in there and nabbing some samples for me in their stead? The snobolds probably have some on them, though I'd expect most of them are dead by now. "
714,Spy Hunter,You must defeat 3 Stormforged Spies in the Valley of Ancient Winters. ,"The rapport you've developed with the inhabitants of Dun Niffelem has yielded some unexpected discoveries. For example, you somehow find yourself able to understand the denmother's guttural growls and sharp quips--at least you think you do. It would seem that she senses danger outside the stronghold and wants you to do something about it. With her forepaw, she removes the chain from around her neck and lets it drop at your feet. As you pick it up you notice an aged fang attached to it. . . "
715,Equipment Recovery,Gretchen Fizzlespark wants you to obtain 8 pieces of K3 Equipment in Sifreldar Village north of K3. ,"Please, <name>.  When the Hyldnir took our men, they also took all our equipment.  Of course, it's more important that we get our boys back, but if you run into any of our equipment, I'd really appreciate it if you brought it back to us. You'll find their village just above us, to the north. "
716,There's Something About the Squire,Obtain a Large Femur from a Skeletal Woodcutter and use it to incapacitate Maloric. ,"Every day, the Black Knight's squire, Maloric, makes a big show of heading to Crystalsong Forest with his axe over his shoulder. He wants us to believe he's chopping wood, but he never returns with more than a few twigs. He usually goes toward the ruins southwest of the Mirror of Twilight. He spends a lot of time out there, even for a squire with responsibilities to his knight. Find a way to distract or incapacitate him and search him. If he's up to something, we'll know it. "
717,A Worthy Weapon,Bring the Blade of Drak'Mar to Arcanist Taelis at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"Our champions have taken a liking to ancient weapons produced here in Northrend. I've heard the bards telling tales of travelers offering winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to the circle of lamps in Drak'Mar Lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills. Ask the lonely maiden for a worthy blade. "
718,The Black Knight of Silverpine? ,Investigate the Black Knight's claims and return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds with your findings. ,"No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end. Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background. He claims to hail from Valgan's Field in Silverpine Forest. It's a small farm on the western shore of Lordamere Lake. Would you visit the farm and let me know if there's any truth to his story? "
719,The Black Knight's Orders,Use the Enchanted Bridle to gain control of the Black Knight's Gryphon and ride it to its destination. ,We must discover who sent the Black Knight to the tournament and what his master hopes to gain by killing the competitors. The Kirin Tor has offered to help in this matter and provided us with something to help our search. Take this enchanted bridle to the Black Knight's camp on the eastern edge of the tournament grounds and use it to gain control over the Black Knight's gryphon. The bridle's magic will force the gryphon to take you to his master's home. Search it and return with anything you find. 
720,The Black Knight's Fall,Defeat the Black Knight and then speak to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"We must put an end to the Black Knight 's scheming, and show those who oppose us that we will not stand by and allow our champions to be murdered. By now, he will suspect that someone is on his trail. Challenge him in the light of day, where he cannot refuse or murder in the dark, <name>. Use my argent charger for the battle. It's housed in the stables. Speak to Squire Cavin at the Ring of Champions. The squire will call the Black Knight to battle, but you will make him answer for his crimes. "
721,A Blade Fit For A Champion,Retrieve the Ashwood Brand and bring it to Magister Edien Sunhollow at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"Some of the champions believe an ancient weapon born of Northrend will bring them luck in the tourney. I have agreed to help them search for these weapons. There's an old legend from Grizzly Hills about a maiden cursed with a frog's form to protect the blade she has long guarded. She lives among the lake frogs on the shore of Ashwood Lake, just east of Ashwood Post. The only thing said to break the curse is a kiss, freely given. Apply this balm before kissing anything, <name>. Otherwise, you'll catch warts. "
722,The Edge Of Winter,Magister Edien Sunhollow at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to bring him Winter's Edge. ,"I heard an interesting story from one of the Ogrimmar valiants. In southern Crystalsong Forest, overlooking the Crystal Vice's exit, you will find Lord Everblaze. Kill him and take the everburning ember from his corpse. Bring it to the center of Winter's Breath Lake in northern Howling Fjord, and use it to free the maiden encased in ice. She is the guardian of an ancient sword and will award it to whoever frees her. Prove your worth and earn the weapon that she has guarded for so long, <name>. "
723,The Seer's Crystal,Bring a Seer's Crystal to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"Now that we know there's no truth to the Black Knight's stories, we must find a way to connect him to the murdered knights. I know a way to reveal the truth about how they died, but it requires a rare material. We must gain a seer's crystal, found only among the unbound seers who congregate near night elf ruins in the Forlorn Woods in the central part of Crystalsong Forest. Find one of these seers, <name>, and bring me the crystal it holds. "
724,The Black Knight of Westfall? ,Investigate the Black Knight's claims and return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds with your findings. ,"No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end. Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background. He claims to be descended from the Cooper family of Westfall. Would you visit their residence in the western part of Moonbrook in Westfall? See if you can find any proof of his story. "
725,Threat From Above,Eadric the Pure at the Argent Tournament wants you to defeat Chillmaw and 3 Cultist Bombardiers. ,"Highlord Tirion Fordring has doubled the guard since your exposure of the Cult of the Damned's infiltrator. He doesn't believe that they will stop just because their Black Knight has been defeated. Our skytalon scouts have reported sighting a frost wyrm named Chillmaw leading a cult raiding party. If we don't intercept them, the tournament will come under attack. The scouts reporting seeing Chillmaw to the southwest, flying over the area between the Ironwall Rampart and Aldur'thar. "
726,The Argent Tournament,Speak with Arcanist Taelis at the Argent Tournament grounds to enroll in the tournament. ,"We have invited you here to test your skill and valor against others who have bravely opposed the Scourge. Many have been our divisions, but the time has come for heroes fighting under all banners to test their blades against one another in preparation for facing our mutual enemy. Arcanist Taelis is the Silver Covenant's representative to the tournament and he'll enter your name into the rolls and begin your training. Seek him out inside the large Alliance tent in the northeastern part of the grounds. "
727,The Edge Of Winter,Marshal Jacob Alerius at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to bring him Winter's Edge. ,"Curse that death knight for breaking my sword! In southern Crystalsong Forest, overlooking the Crystal Vice's exit, you will find Lord Everblaze. Kill him and take the everburning ember from his corpse.

Prove your worth and earn the weapon that she has guarded for so long, <name>. "
728,A Blade Fit For A Champion,Retrieve the Ashwood Brand and bring it to Arcanist Taelis at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"Some of the champions believe an ancient weapon born of Northrend will bring them luck in the tourney.

729,A Blade Fit For A Champion,Retrieve the Ashwood Brand and bring it to Marshal Jacob Alerius at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"Good, honest, honed steel may not carry the day. The other combatants are using enchanted blades and I find myself at a disadvantage, but all is not lost.

She lives among the lake frogs on the shore of Ashwood Lake, just east of Ashwood Post. The only thing said to break the curse is a kiss, freely given.

Seek him out inside the large Horde tent in the southeastern part of the grounds. "
732,The Stories Dead Men Tell,"Use the Seer's Crystal at the graves of Sir Wendell Balfour, Lorien Sunblaze, and Conall Irongrip to determine how they died, then return to Crusader Rhydalla. ","The crystal will reveal the truth about how three of the tournament's combatants died. Take it with you to the graveyard east of the Tournament Grounds and use it before the graves of Sir Wendell Balfour, Lorien Sunblaze, and Conall Irongrip. If indeed these men were murdered, then we must find a way to tie it to the Black Knight before he strikes again. Look closely at what the crystal tells you, <name>, for we must be certain these deaths were not accidental. "
733,Up To The Challenge,Present Magister Edien Sunhollow at the Argent Tournament with 15 Aspirant's Seals to signify you're ready to undergo the aspirant's challenge. ,"When you have mastered the skills of the aspirant, you may choose to take the aspirant's challenge.

735,Get Kraken! ,"Crusader Silverdawn wants you to mount an Argent Hippogryph, throw 6 Flaming Spears at the North Sea Kraken and take out 3 Vrykul Deepcallers. ","The Sunreavers and Silver Covenant sent ships north to engage the Kvaldir at Hrothgar's Landing, but were intercepted and detained by a Kvaldir Raiding vessel.  To make matters worse, the Kvaldir have found a way to call forth the dreaded Kraken that lives beneath the North Sea.

738,Breakfast Of Champions,Acquire 4 Jormungar Egg Sacs and bring them to Savinia Loresong at the Argent Tournament Grounds. ,"Now that the coliseum is complete, the Argent Crusade has asked us to help look after the creatures that champions will be fighting.

855,Unfinished Business,Har'koa wants you to speak with Tol'mar at Dubra'jin. ,"While it is true that the Prophet of Akali will trouble this world no more, there yet remains work to be done. The greater part of Akali's blood has empowered another, and it is in him that the true danger lies. Quickly, <name>, make your way north of Gundrak to Dubra'Jin and speak with Tol'mar. He will be able to direct you further in this cause. "
856,The Leaders at Jin'Alai,"Scalper Ahunae at Zim'Torga has asked you to retrieve the Treasure of Kutube'sa, the Treasure of Gawanil, and the Treasure of Chulo the Mad.

859,Sabotage,Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to perform another task for Drakuru. ,"While we're working to discover the purpose of these crystals, we need you back in Voltarus doing Drakuru's bidding. Every task you perform successfully gets you closer to him, and brings us that much nearer to knowing his mind. While you're there, I have another mission for you. Drakuru's Scourgewagons pose a significant threat. We need them destroyed. Make your way to the wagons and activate these charges. Once they're set, get clear! The explosion will expose you if you're too close. "
860,Infiltrating Voltarus,Stefan wants you to use your Ensorcelled Choker to get into Voltarus and do whatever the Scourge leader there asks of you. ,"By now you've probably guessed the details of my plan. We're using the Scourge's interest in you against them. You're going undercover. I know it's likely a death sentence, but if we do nothing your death is a certainty. Travel northeast to Reliquary of Pain and stand on the platform while wearing your disguise. Once inside Voltarus, you must earn the trust of the Scourge commander. When you've completed your mission, blow this horn and I'll fly to your location to receive your report. "
861,Lab Work,"Alchemist Finklestein at Heb'Valok wants you to find a Muddy Mire Maggot, a Withered Batwing, an Amberseed, and some Chilled Serpent Mucus from within his laboratory. ","I assume by your interruption that you wish to be numbered among those I am considering for apprenticeship. A worthy aspiration. . . Should I someday choose to accept your petition, I must be confident that you can find your way around my laboratory. I have many ingredients here; some plentiful, and others in short supply. Take your time, <class>. Find a muddy mire maggot, a withered batwing, an amberseed, and some chilled serpent mucus. Succeed, and I'll know to take your request seriously. "
862,Zero Tolerance,Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to go to the Reliquary of Pain and use the Scepter of Empowerment on a Servant of Drakuru. ,"Ignorance! Dis be intolerable, mon! My entire batch of blight be useless! Dat mongrel, Darmuk! He be responsible for watchin over da blight. He failed me, mon! Dis be a good lesson for ya, <name>. Failure be like a disease dat spreads.

Let dat be an example to all, mon. Don't be failin' Drakuru! "
863,The Gods Have Spoken,Deliver the Unblemished Heart of the Guardian and the Gusty Essence of the Warden to Har'koa at Zim'Torga. ,"The gods have spoken and we must heed their wisdom. Gather friends to your side, <name>. Take them north to Zim'Rhuk to destroy guardians there until they yield the unblemished heart. Take them east to the Altar of Quetz'lun and disrupt the altar wardens until you recover their gusty essence. Deliver both to Har'koa and she will combine them into that which will compel late Akali's prophet to appear. "
864,"An Invitation, of Sorts. . . ",Take the Unliving Choker to Stefan at Ebon Watch. ,"Crafted of bone and dripping with blood, this choker is of intricate and deliberate design. Gazing upon it overwhelms you with an ominous presence - one that compels you to wear it. You fight the urge, and resolve to bring it back to Ebon Watch. If anyone can explain this, a death knight can. . . . "
865,Convocation at Zol'Heb,Har'koa at Zim'Torga has asked you to slay the Prophet of Akali. ,"You and your friends must take this instrument of convocation - of summoning - to Zol'Heb just south of Gundrak. Therein you will find a circle of power. Use the convocation to force the prophet of Akali to appear. My heart goes out to you, <name>. We have been through much together, and you have done all that you can to not only save my life, but those of the other gods the Drakkari have destroyed. But I fear this time we may not see each other again until the afterlife. "
866,Gluttonous Lurkers,Deliver 5 Basilisk Crystals to Alchemist Finklestein in the shrine at Heb'Valok. ,"My master, Finklestein, is in the shrine at Heb'Valok to the northwest preparing a truth serum, and he needs basilisk crystals. Heb'Valok is on the west side of the road leading north before the Altar of Sseratus. There are basilisks to the east at Drak'Agal. If you grab the Zul'Drak rats and throw them at the basilisk, they will become gorged and docile after eating five. Then you'll be able to take their crystals. Killing the basilisk won't do you any good. That'd just break its crystals! "
867,The Key of Warlord Zol'Maz,Har'koa at Zim'Torga has asked you to acquire the Key of Warlord Zol'Maz. ,"<name>, we need a key to unlock the chains of the rhino god, Akali. Even now he is being prepared for the slaughter. The Drakkari warlord, Zol'Maz, carries the key. Hearing of your exploits, he has secluded himself and his family at their stronghold up the steps to the northeast. The warlord is strong and you will need help. If you were to combine the tiki, sword and incantation of his family members, you would be able to summon such help as you challenge him before his home's gate. "
868,"So Far, So Bad",Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to return to Drakuru and complete any tasks he has for you. ,"Everything you've reported is consistent with what we know. Learning of Drakuru and earning his trust will lay the groundwork for your future missions. Return to him and do as he says. Do whatever you must to appear sincere, <name>. A great deal is riding upon your performance. This time I'm adding an additional assignment: While you're in the field, pour this additive into their blight cauldrons. It should neutralize the scourging agent and render the batch useless. "
869,In Search Of Answers,Search Rageclaw Den for a clue about who or what initiated the attacks against the Rageclaw Wolvar. ,"These poor creatures are the only survivors. According to their chief, the Drakkari trolls and Rageclaw wolvar have been allies for thousands of years. They've been living here, alongside the trolls, for generations, completely unaware of the ever changing world around them. To the Rageclaw, a troll is a troll, so the troll attack upon their den took them by surprise. We need some answers, <name>. Scour their village - southeast of here - for clues as to who or what is in charge of these attacks. "
870,Kickin' Nass and Takin' Manes,Stefan in Ebon Watch wants you to use Nass to collect 10 hair samples from Withered Trolls. ,"Before you meet Nass, there's something you should know. He got a toxic dose of blight back in the day, and now he's deaf, blind, and mostly numb. It's not all bad, though. He's virtually immune to the stuff now, which makes him perfect for certain tasks - like the one I'm about to give you. There are many freshly scourged trolls nearby and we need to study the blight's effect on them. Take Nass, and this boot. When you've slain a troll, give him a good kick and he'll know to take a hair sample. "
871,Dark Horizon,Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to speak to Gorebag and take the tour of Zul'Drak. ,"Ahh, another supplicant answerin' da Lich King's call. <Drakuru sniffs you. >Freshly scourged, eh?

Dere be much ta do if you're to be of any worth to me. "
872,Leave No One Behind,Dr. ,"Ahh, good. They sent someone. Listen, <race>. We need a hand here. Our forces were pushed back and we've lost Drak'Sotra to the Scourge. Where they came from is anyone's guess. . . . The point is, we need every man we can get here, and some of our best have yet to return from battle. I need you to enter the ruins now that the fighting has died down and find our wounded, patch them up, and bring them here to me. Scour Drak'Sotra! They couldn't have gone far. "
873,You Reap What You Sow,Slay the Drained Prophet of Quetz'lun and then inform Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga. ,"This is what it has come down to. . . revenge. < Har'koa sighs. >Take this ritual kit and enact it near Quetz'lun's corpse upon her altar. If everything works properly, her spirit should be drawn into the material world where she will be able to reclaim her power from the prophet. The rest will be up to you, <name>. You must slay the prophet in his drained state. "
874,The Amphitheater of Anguish: Yggdras! ,Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Yggdras! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward. ,"I was wondering when you'd show up, <name>! Having a past champion of the Ring of Blood here will be a huge draw! We're gonna be rich, buddy! RICH! Anyway, this dump is Zul'Drak. All the ice trolls seem to use it as a toilet. I dunno, the whole place is off its rocker if you ask me! Who cares, though, right? We're here to make some gold! You know the drill, <name>. When you're ready let me know and we'll get this show on the road! "
875,Blood of a Dead God,Har'koa has asked you to collect 7 Blood of Mam'toth. ,"Mam'toth, the god of the mammoths, destroyed himself, and took much of his temple with him, rather than allowing his trolls to gain his power. If I'm to sacrifice a portion of my spirit, I will need something with which to bolster myself. Mam'toth left behind an enormous crater to the northeast, just north of the Altar of Quetz'lun. Within the crater his blood yet lives. Bring it to me. "
876,Malas the Corrupter,Sergeant Moonshard at Drak'Sotra insists that you return with the Head of the Corrupter. ,"<name>, gather at least one other person and head back down there! You'll find the leader of Kolramas, Malas the Corrupter, gloating from atop the crashed necropolis. Kill him and bring me his head! "
877,The Amphitheater of Anguish: Korrak the Bloodrager! ,Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Korrak the Bloodrager! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward. ,"You're not gonna believe this, pal. Your next fight is against Korrak the Bloodrager! Looks like the Drakkari trolls are pulling a power play! And let me tell you, buddy, he's been sippin' the animal god juice. He's good and ready to pound you into the ground. Are you ready? "
878,Precious Elemental Fluids,Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand wants you to acquire 3 Precious Elemental Fluids. ,"<The hexxer examines the decanter of mojo. >I have an idea for how to deal with the prophet of Sseratus. But first, we're going to need some things. The Drak'Sotra Fields are directly to the south. Because of the stresses on the land from the Scourge and the deaths of gods, the wall between worlds has weakened and the elementals are flooding in. We need the precious fluids of their lords. If you combine three links from the elementals a tether will be made, and one of their lords can be summoned. "
879,Pa'Troll,"Commander Kunz at The Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their leaders' orders, and then return and report to him. ","Welcome to The Argent Stand, scrub. I am Commander Kunz, but you - you can call me. . . Commander. Don't think you're going to just cruise through my region, picking which missions you're going to participate in, answering to no one. Here, you report to me and you follow my orders to the letter. Understood? ! First, you're going to get familiar with my men and the region we're charged with clearing. Report to each of them and do as they ask. Return to me when your patrol is done. "
880,Near Miss,Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to take the Unliving Choker to Bloodrose Datura. ,"It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, <race>. Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurance. You've been targeted by someone, or something. . . . Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you. "
881,Just Checkin',To'kini wants you to speak to Bah'kini at Dubra'Jin. ,There have been fearsome sounds echoing from Gundrak. They have been increasing in volume and frequency of late. My long-time student is currently recording events from her post just west of Gundrak. Perhaps you could find the time to check in on her for me? 
882,Mushroom Mixer,Collect 10 Muddlecap Fungus and deliver them to Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand. ,"Now what we need is something to spike the mojo with. Something that'll make it so that when the prophet drinks it, he'll become less powerful. Drak'Agal lies to the east. There's a mushroom there that the natives call muddlecap fungus. I think it's exactly what we need. Bring back lots of them. When we mix them into the mojo, the mind of anyone who drinks it will become muddled. "
883,But First My Offspring,Har'koa has asked you to use her whisker on the corpses of her children to free and resurrect them. ,"I am the last of the gods to be subdued, so we must first attempt to free the others. Bound by the magics of my subduers, I am unable to discern their fates. But first, I would ask that you do me a kindness. Already the Drakkari turn my magic against me. They have transformed my offspring into monstrosities. Take one of my whiskers. Slay my tortured children and use the magic of it to release them from their nightmare, and bring them back to life. "
884,Hell Hath a Fury,"Quetz'lun's Spirit at the Altar of Quetz'lun wants you to use Quetz'lun's Hexxing Stick upon High Priest Mu'funu, High Priestess Tua-Tua, and High Priest Hawinni. ","It is now time for you to punish my three high priests: Mu'funu, Tua-Tua, and Hawinni. You'll find them spread around the altar grounds. Take this hexxing stick. I've empowered it with my rage and indignation. I'm sure that it will prove potent. Just use it and proceed to destroy them. The hex will take care of the rest. <Quetz'lun displays a toothy grin. >Succeed and I may let you go. Fail and die. "
885,"You Can Run, But You Can't Hide",Stefan in Ebon Watch asked you to go to the Reliquary of Agony to collect 5 Putrid Abomination Guts from the Putrid Abominations and 5 Gooey Ghoul Drools. ,"Once the Scourge have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it. You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse. . . . <Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin. >. . . unless we can use their desires against them. I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components. Travel due east of here to the Reliquary of Agony. Slay abominations and gather the ghoul drool you'll find there then return to me with their remnants. "
886,Rampage,Har'koa at Zim'Torga has asked you to free Akali and then to inform Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga. ,"<name>, there is no time left. You must take the key and use it to unlock Akali. He is being held in the courtyard in front of Gundrak, the capital of Zul'Drak. Akali's chains are secured by four anchor points. You must unlock each of them to set the rhino god free. Gundrak is teeming with ice trolls. However, I believe that if you're careful, you should be able to slip in without too much danger. Once you're done, please inform the witch doctor. "
887,Spirit of Rhunok,Speak with the Spirit of Rhunok at the Altar of Rhunok. ,My feelings tell me that Rhunok doesn't have much time.

888,The Blessing of Zim'Torga,Witch Doctor Khufu wants you to present 10 Drakkari Offerings to the statue of Zim'Torga. ,"Hexxer Ubungo probably told you about making offerings to the gods of Zul'Drak. Zim'Abwa is not the only god that stands forgotten by the Drakkari. We have taken refuge within the presence of Zim'Torga, the Mother of Prosperity. As with Zim'Abwa, if you were to give offerings of the Drakkari to her, she is sure to give you her blessing. "
889,Troll Patrol: The Alchemist's Apprentice,Alchemist Finklestein at Heb'Valok wants you to assist him in the creation of a truth serum. ,"Ahh, you must be the promised patrol. Your timing couldn't be better. I have urgent need of an extra pair of hands. We have a Drakkari prisoner who's been sent here to undergo questioning. Before the interrogation begins, I require assistance in the creation of a truth serum.

892,Too Much of a Good Thing,Slay the Muddled Prophet of Sseratus and then return to Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand. ,"There. I've modified the mojo. Now when the prophet drinks it, not only will he lose some of his power, his mind will also be addled by the effects of the fungus. At least that's the theory. As for how to get him to drink it, might I suggest you simply throw it at him? No doubt he'll catch and drink it given the arrogance that he's displayed at the altar. Unless you can kill him, <class>, your Argent Crusade is about to come to a terrible end. "
893,Troll Patrol,"Commander Kunz at the Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their captain's orders, and then return and report to him. ","Unsheathe that weapon, <race>. It's time to go on patrol! I've got four posts under my command and it's crucial to our success that they remain in our control. I'm ordering you to visit each of them and offer your assistance. You can begin with Captain Brandon southeast of here. He'll direct you to the next post when he's finished with you.

All of my people are fighting. Tell you what, you've come this far, you think you're up to doing me a small favor? Head out there and round up my soldiers?

897,The Amphitheater of Anguish: Magnataur! ,Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Stinkbeard! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward. ,"This next match is a doozy, buddy! Apparently some magnataur from the Dragonblight wants a piece of the action.

898,The Blessing of Zim'Rhuk,Witch Doctor Khufu wants you to present 10 Drakkari Offerings to the statue of Zim'Rhuk. ,"There is another god of Zul'Drak that is being neglected. Zim'Rhuk 's statue lies directly to the north. Known as ""The Wise One"", Zim'Rhuk is also known to be very protective of his domain. He maintains guardians that deal harshly with anyone that does not have the wits to slip past them. Avoid the guardians and give the Drakkari offerings to Zim'Rhuk so that you will benefit from his blessing. "
899,Breaking Through Jin'Alai,"Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga has asked you to disturb the Blue Cauldron, Green Cauldron, Purple Cauldron, and Red Cauldron. ","I have been trying to commune with the gods. However, the medicine men at the Pools of Jin'Alai are performing rituals that are interfering with my attempts. It is imperative that we break through their obtrusion. If you were to head southwest into the pools area, I am certain that you would come across the cauldrons they are using for their magic.

When you are ready, ask and I will call one of my kittens for you. "
901,That's What Friends Are For. . . ,"Crusader MacKellar at Crusader Forward Camp has asked that you find Crusader Dargath, Gerk and Burr. ","We were attacked by Prince Navarius and at least a dozen Scourge. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, ""If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all. "" He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen. I heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to Thrym's End, northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them? "
902,Reunited,Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to speak to Gorebag and take the tour of Zul'Drak. ,"<name>! Ya musta received mah gift! Turn around, mon, lemme get a good look at ya. . .

903,Dressing Down,Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to use the Ensorceled Choker to apply the Scourge disguise. ,"There. . . I've created a disguise that should make you indistinguishable from the Scourge. You'll be free to walk among them as long as the disguise holds. Only the blightguards will be able to see through my illusion. Watch out for them! Another thing you must know is that the disguise is unstable and may drop unexpectedly, so stay alert.

904,Gymer's Salvation,Engineer Reed at Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak wants you to bring him 6 Banshee Essence and 6 Diatomaceous Earth. ,"Now you say that he's locked up in a 100 foot tall cage, eh? If my calculations are correct, we should be able to at least weaken the hinges on the cage, giving the giant enough leeway to break out. If this is going to work I'm going to need some plasticizers and stabilizers. Banshee essence should do nicely for the plasticizer. You can get that from the banshees in the Dead Fields, northeast of us. The stabilizer can be found on the earthragers to the southwest, near Ebon Watch. Get a move on! "
905,A Tangled Skein,Specialist Cogwheel at Drak'Sotra has asked you to use the Tangled Skein Thrower in order to cause the destruction of 5 Plague Sprayers. ,There! One tangled skein thrower ready and waiting for you to take those plague sprayers down. You just aim and let loose. The webbing should foul up their hover spells long enough to cause them to crash to the ground just like Kolramas. Kind of poetic. I like that! 
906,Foundation for Revenge,"Quetz'lun's Spirit has tasked you with the destruction of 12 trolls, either Quetz'lun Worshippers or Serpent-Touched Berserkers, near her Soul Fonts. ","I have something special planned for my favorite high priests. But first you get to prove yourself in laying the foundation for my revenge. You do still want to live, yes?

There are fragments of the power that fueled my curse scattered about the altar grounds. It is my desire that you collect some of them for me.

By the time I realized that his cry for help was a trap, it was too late. I am now a prisoner of the Scourge and I fear that soon I will suffer the same fate as many of the other storm giants.

I'm given to understand that you might be heading northeast up to the Zol'Maz Stronghold. Such a trip presents a great opportunity for us to conclude our Drakkari goods gathering. As I have come to know, the Drakkari warlord is extremely paranoid. He's had all of his caches at the stronghold hexed with dire magic. Rumor has it that his tiki warriors carry the cure, but who can say? If you could find the time to acquire some of those goods, I would be most appreciative. "
917,This Just In: Fire Still Hot! ,Elder Shaman Moky at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak wants you to use the Rageclaw Fire Extinguisher to douse 15 hut fires at Rageclaw Den. ,"Trolls attack Rageclaw Den and kick Rageclaw out!

The children of Mam'toth are enraged and cry out for justice! Follow the avenue northeast up the steps to the next tier of Zul'Drak. On your right you will find what's left of the Altar of Mam'toth. When you get there, flash this Medallion of Mam'toth in front of the eyes of one of the enraged mammoths. It'll calm down for a little while, letting you hop on its back. Ride it around, trampling all of the Mam'toth disciples that you can find! "
920,Seek the Wind Serpent Goddess,Seek Quetz'lun's Spirit at the Altar of Quetz'lun. ,"You are prepared, but I'm not certain that you're ready for what is to come. When you cross back over into Quetz'lun's altar area, you will enter the realm of the dead. From what I can feel of it, it's not going to be pleasant. Try not to be distracted by what you see in there. Simply head for the altar building and seek out Quetz'lun's Spirit. "
921,Throwing Down,Captain Rupert at Drak'Sotra wants you to use High Impact Grenades near 5 Nerubian Craters. ,"Clever. . . Just when it seemed we were getting things under control, they tunneled right underneath us and secured the shrine!

","I couldn't help but overhear what you were talking to the sergeant about. That doesn't change the fact that we still have a job to do here.

924,Light Won't Grant Me Vengeance,Gerk at Thrym's End in Zul'Drak wants you to kill 15 Vargul. ,"They. . . They killed my brother. < Gerk fights back tears. >Slaughtered him like he was some sort of animal. Now they got him laid out on one of their tables on the other side of the camp, ready for their grizzly experiments. Dargath's dead too. The paladin made a heroic stand at the ruins to the northeast, but the leader of the Vargul, Algar, was too strong. I'm all that's left and I'll be dead soon too. I. . . I'm turning. If the Light won't grant me vengeance, maybe you will, <class>. Kill them all. "
925,Defend the Stand,Commander Falstaav has tasked you with the destruction of any 10 Scourge in the courtyard at The Argent Stand. ,"Despite our substantial successes in the lower third of Zul'Drak, we must still face the onslaught of the Scourge. Such is the way in this frigid hell. The attacks are unrelenting, yet my men need rest. If you are willing, we could use your aid in reinforcing them.

926,One Last Thing,Deliver the Underworld Power Fragments to Har'koa and beseech her for a portion of her spirit. ,"There is one last thing that is needed to enact the final revenge against my prophet. The power fragments you collected must be imbued with a portion of a living gods' spirit. You're going to need to beseech Har'koa for some of hers. Once you've done that, when you return here, you will not come to the underworld. Instead, you will return to the physical world of my altar. My children and guardians will no longer attack you, and you'll be able to get to my prophet without having to worry about them. "
927,"My Prophet, My Enemy",The Spirit of Rhunok at the Altar of Rhunok has asked you to acquire his Arctic Bear God Mojo. ,"My prophet absorbed too much of my power too quickly, and subsequently killed himself. You can see the results at the water-filled crater to the south in Drak'Mabwa. My former priests have already resurrected him so that he can finish the job.

928,Congratulations! ,You made excellent time on that patrol. ,"You made excellent time on that patrol. It appears that you may be of use to us after all. As promised, here's a little something extra for your efforts. Keep up the good work, <name>. Dismissed. "

931,Siphoning the Spirits,Captain Arnath at Heb'Valok wants you to collect 5 Ancient Ectoplasms from the Lost Drakkari Spirits at the Pools of Zha'Jin. ,"You should be happy he's coming, they said. You'll enjoy his company, they said. . . . Well it's not as if I had a choice in the matter. Finklestein is the Crusade's best alchemist. I suppose I should be honored that he's chosen my post to set up shop. But ever since he's arrived, I've been relegated to collecting various alchemical ingredients. Say, <race>, how about you give me a hand? Just south of here are some pools that are haunted by spirits of ancient trolls. Collect their ectoplasm for me. "
932,First Things First,Commander Kunz at Argent Stand wants you to report to Sergeant Riannah at Light's Breach. ,"Listen up, <race>! This entire region is full of crises. Everywhere you look you'll find those who could use your assistance. <Kunz looks you squarely in the eye. >No one needs your help right now more than Riannah.

934,Crusader Forward Camp,Seek out Crusader MacKellar at the Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak. ,"Crusader Dargath, Crusader MacKellar, Engineer Reed and the twins, Gerk and Burr, were sent to the Dead Fields to establish a battle front days ago. As of my last correspondence with them, they had successfully established a camp on the border of the Dead Fields, northwest of here. In light of this newfound information about Drakuru and Prince Navarius I think it would be prudent to send someone to the Crusader Forward Camp post-haste. Pack up your belongings, <name>. You must leave at once! "
935,To the Witch Doctor,Speak with Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga. ,"We Zandalari could use your help, <name>. We must put an end to what the Drakkari are doing to their gods! To the northeast, up the great steps that lead to the next tier of Zul'Drak, lies Zim'Torga. It is the home to another of the god statues and a refuge that my people are desparately attempting to defend. I would like for you to travel there and speak to Witch Doctor Khufu. Be warned though, the place is under constant attack from the Drakkari. "
936,Stocking the Shelves,Captain Arnath in Heb'Valok asked you to collect 7 units of Fresh Spider Ichor from the Trapdoor Crawlers in Zul'Drak. ,"Listen, <class>. I realize that it's a lot to ask. . . . Fresh spider ichor is somewhat hard to come by, even in these heavily infested regions. But Finklestein said he'd settle for no less than a vat of it, and that he needs it soon. I'll keep my men out in the field collecting reagents, but if the alchemist's order is going to be filled in time, they'll require some assistance. As you roam the fields of Zul'Drak, keep your eyes peeled for trapdoor crawlers and bring me all of the ichor you can find. "
937,Orders From Drakuru,Return the Orders From Drakuru to Crusader Lord Lantinga at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak. ,Minions be hearin' da call of your masta!

938,Cocooned! ,Captain Rupert wants you to open the Nerubian Cocoons in Drak'Sotra and return to him once you have freed 3 Captive Footmen. ,"Now that the tunnels have been sealed, our next concern is recovering those who have fallen to the enemy. With any luck, several of our soldiers are still alive and relatively well inside the nerubian cocoons. Free them, <class>, while you still can! "
939,Bringing Down Heb'Jin,Element-Tamer Dagoda at Zim'Torga wants you to kill Heb'Jin. ,"<Dagoda looks at Ahunae and sighs. >You want to really deal with Heb'Drakkar? Collecting scalps isn't going to get the job done. You have to take out their leader, Heb'Jin. The problem is, he's up on the bat rookery goading his forces on. Bang his drum and I guarantee that he'll fly down. That's when you kill him. You can take this net we got from one of his headhunters. Use it to trap his bat when he lands. That way you won't have to fight both of them. "
940,Taking a Stand,Bloodrose Datura at Ebon Watch wants you to speak with Commander Falstaav at The Argent Stand. ,"A few moments ago I spotted a signal flare over the treeline to the east. That can only mean that things are not going smoothly for the Crusaders at Argent Stand. I cannot leave our post here, <race>, but you can. When time permits, make your way up to Commander Falstaav and see if there's anything you can do to lighten their burden. "
941,Sealing the Rifts,Scalper Ahunae at Zim'Torga has asked you to seal 7 Elemental Rifts. ,"Dagoda gonna be sendin' you northwest to Drak'Mabwa to get her more stuff for her defenders if she didn't already. While you up there, Ahunae be wantin' you to destroy the rifts those elementals pourin' out of. The last thing we needin' is for them to attack us! Just watch out, more of those frozen earth'll show up when you try to seal the rifts. "
942,Back to Har'koa,Speak with Har'koa at the Altar of Har'koa. ,"And now it is time for you to return to the leopard goddess. Somehow I sense that she has other plans for you. Tell her that no matter what, we are eternal. "
943,Silver Lining,Stefan in Ebon Watch asked you to go to the Reliquary of Agony to collect 5 Putrid Abomination Guts from the Putrid Abominations and 5 Gooey Ghoul Drools. ,"Once the Scourge have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it. You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse. . . . <Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin. >. . . unless we can use their desires against them. I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components. Travel due east of here to the land beneath the Reliquary of Agony. Slay the ghouls and abominations you'll find there and return to me with their remnants. "
944,Levixus the Soul Caller,Destroy Levixus and take the Book of the Dead from his possession. ,"Go now, <name>. You will find Levixus on the uppermost ruins of Auchindoun. Enter there from the southern reaches of the Bone Wastes. He stands amidst a storm of souls. . . Destroy him and take the book of the dead. Once you have the cursed book in your possession, destroy it! Destroy it so that such an atrocity can never again be made possible. "
945,Terokk's Legacy,"Bring Terokk's Mask, Terokk's Quill, and the Saga of Terokk to Isfar outside the Sethekk Halls. ","My people honor an ancient hero named Terokk. Arakkoa hatchlings are regaled with stories of his deeds and descriptions of his beautiful plumage. He dwelt among my people for hundreds of years, but mysteriously vanished one day, leaving only his mask, spear, and writings behind. The relics are cherished by the arakkoa, but they were heartbroken when the Sethekk bore the objects away from Skettis at their departure. I have written down what little I know about their location within the halls. "
946,I See Dead Draenei,"Speak to Ramdor the Mad, standing on the bone pile outside of the Auchenai Crypts. ","I see dead draenei. They're all around us. Bah, nobody believes me because I'm a child. Not even my own mommy believes me. < Ha'lei points to Ramdor. >He believes me, though. . . He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it! It's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up! You should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest. "
947,The Soul Devices,Steal 5 Soul Devices and deliver them to Spymistress Mehlisah Highcrown at the Terrace of the Light in Shattrath City. ,"Gah!  They've been torturing me, trying to get me to tell them everything that I know. I failed - they fed the others to Hellmaw, and I was to be next.  But I told them nothing! They're crazy!  They're hell-bent on summoning demonic forces that they have no way of controlling! They're using special devices to make their soul shards, and their summoning, more powerful.  You must steal these devices! I would join you, but I must return to Shattrath City to report to the Lower City's spymistress. "
948,Ezekiel,Find and speak with Ezekiel of Shattrath in Shattrath City. ,"I believe that the dead, which we have been caring for these last 500 odd years, should be left alone. Maladaar has other plans. He has retreated to the Crypt of Remembrance to start his experiments. . . Necromancy. I hope you weren't thinking about going in there. . . Not before helping me out so that these damned spirits will finally leave me alone. I know where they keep their treasures, <race>. Got your attention, eh? Bring me the book of the dead, held by the Aldor, Ezekiel of Shattrath. "
949,Find Spy To'gun,Locate Spy To'gun in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun. ,"To'gun, the fool!  We're barely holding off the attacks here, and he goes back in to get more information and try to save the other spies! I don't know whether to love him or kill him! The Shadow Council must have used magic to ferret us out, because all of our spies had to get out of there in a hurry.  Most of us didn't make it. Please, if you're brave enough to enter the Shadow Labyrinth, will you keep an eye peeled for To'gun?  It's been a while, and I fear the worst. "
950,Into the Heart of the Labyrinth,Destroy Murmur and inform Spymistress Mehlisah Highcrown at the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City of the events that have transpired inside the Shadow Labyrinth. ,"The Shadow Council has lost control of the cosmic being that they summoned here almost two years ago!  It is what caused the explosion of Auchindoun, and the creation of the Bone Wastes beyond. Known only as Murmur, it threatens to overrun the Shadow Council and break free into the outside world! With the grandmaster, and the rest of their leadership dead, you are Outland's last hope against this monstrosity! <name>, you know at the core of your being that you and your companions dare not fail! "
951,Brother Against Brother,"Kill Darkweaver Syth in the Sethekk halls, then free Lakka from captivity. ","The Sethekk departed Skettis with great fanfare when Auchindoun exploded. Surely it must've been an omen of our master's arrival. My brother, Syth, was one of their leaders and told us we were obligated to go into the temple ruins and face our god. After we took up residence in the ruins, calling them the Sethekk Halls, I began to doubt my brother and his ally, Ikiss. In time, Syth had me cast out of the Halls, but he refused to let me take our sister Lakka with me. Will you help me rescue her? "
952,Trouble at Auchindoun,Report to Field Commander Mahfuun at the entrance to the Shadow Labyrinth at Auchindoun in Terokkar Forest. ,"I have spies within Auchindoun and they have been sending me disturbing reports.  That place has been nothing but trouble ever since it exploded a couple of years ago. Something in there has gone horribly wrong - again - and the Shadow Council is now on a war footing.  Though the reports were lacking on details, their preparations appear to be directed inward. You must make your way to the entrance of the Shadow Labyrinth.  My field commander, Mahfuun, will fill you in on what needs to be done. "
953,The Book of Fel Names,Venture inside the Shadow Labyrinth in Auchindoun and obtain the Book of Fel Names from Blackheart the Inciter. ,"I sympathize with your intentions of stopping Varedis and his followers, but you won't stand a chance against him.  That is, unless you find the artifact that gave him his power. The Book of Fel Names is rumored to be in the possession of Blackheart the Inciter inside the Shadow Labyrinth in Auchindoun.  Obtaining it will be your only hope against Varedis. "
954,Wanted: Murmur's Whisper,Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain Murmur's Whisper. ,"When I'm done speaking, you may not want to take this commission. I have an eccentric client who specializes in the study of dead realities. It is rumored that the being known as Murmur destroyed the last world from which he was summoned. The professor is interested in examining his 'whisper' as he called it to understand how it is that Murmur accomplished such a feat. Will you journey to the Shadow Labyrinth within Auchindoun and retrieve it for me? "
955,The Codex of Blood,Read from the Codex of Blood in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun. ,"It has been two years since the Shadow Council summoning that resulted in the explosion of this once-great mausoleum, and the formation of the Bone Wastes. Now they are at war with an unbelievably powerful force on the inside. <name>, you must make your way into the Shadow Labyrinth to determine what they are up against, and to see if it poses a threat to us.  Our spies speak of their use of a forbidden book of unholy summoning, known only as the Codex of Blood. Seek your answers within its pages. "
956,Wanted: The Exarch's Soul Gem,Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to recover The Exarch's Soul Gem. ,Within Auchindoun's Auchenai Crypts many unsavory experiments are undertaken in the pursuit of a greater understanding of the necromantic arts. Many are the spirits that are tortured or destroyed therein. I have a customer who is interested in the liberation of one of those spirits. I have been informed that this spirit is contained within a soul gem held by none other than Exarch Maladaar himself. Seek him out within the crypts with all due haste and return to me with the gem. 
957,Wanted: Shaffar's Wondrous Pendant,Wind Trader Zhareem wants you to obtain Shaffar's Wondrous Amulet. ,"Today I have a personal request of you, yet the reward will certainly match the danger. My family has a 'history', shall we say, with Nexus-Prince Shaffar and his followers. If the amulet he wears were to fall into my hands then surely that would mean that he had been dealt with. If the bounty I am offering is of interest to you then journey to his lair within Auchindoun's Mana-Tombs. "
958,Wanted: The Headfeathers of Ikiss,Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to acquire The Headfeathers of Ikiss. ,"I've recently been approached by a tauren whose husband is about to be elevated to chieftain. She wishes to make a special addition to his headdress. Specifically, she wants to obtain the headfeathers from the dastardly Talon King Ikiss. If you are interested in collecting my reward, travel to Auchindoun's Sethekk Halls and find him. "
959,Wanted: Malicious Instructors,Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to kill 3 Malicious Instructors. ,"Mah'duun has heard it said that none are as cruel as the six-armed demonesses inside the Shadow Labyrinth. Go to Auchindoun, seek them out, kill them all. If you cannot accomplish so simple a task, we do not have anything further to say to one another. "
962,An Apexis Relic,Gain Apexis Vibrations from an Apexis Relic. ,"Long ago a now-extinct sect of the arakkoa known as the Apexis lived here.  Remnants of their civilization are still present.  We call them apexis relics. What we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon.  Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last. An apexis shard is needed to power the relic.  Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration. "
963,Scratches,Use the Fistful of Feathers on the Lashh'an Spell Circle. ,The pictograms indicate using feathers to cast the spell at one of the circles of power in Veil Lashh. Confusing iconography seems to show an arakkoa being suffused with the spirit of a kaliri. 
964,The Relic's Emanation,Gain Apexis Emanations from an Apexis Relic. ,"Now that you have felt the enlightening vibrations of the apexis relics, it is time for you to further your understanding of their workings.  We are very eager to benefit from your observations! As you progress in your ability to attune to the relics, you will gain a higher level of knowledge.  This recognition will come in the form of an emanation from the relic. Return to us when you have attained such an emanation. "
965,Show Them Gnome Mercy! ,Collect the Collection of Souls. ,"<The blood drains out of Toshley 's face. >These orbs are made up of both nether energy and souls, some of them gnome souls! How dare they!  Were they the ones killing our people that traveled north? ! <name>, you must put a stop to this, and the only way to do that is to finish off their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan. You'll have to coax him out of hiding though.  I'm guessing that you can do that by killing a lot of his Razaani ethereal. Bring me the collection of souls that he no doubt has. "
966,Vision Guide,"Use the Fiery Soul Fragment to transform your spirit into a vision guide, which will reveal the location of the final Thunderlord artifact. ","<race> fool.  You almost destroyed the drum! I've worked too hard to get here, and my hands have been empty up until now.  At least you were able to succeed where the others only met with failure, or worse. It is time to evoke a vision that will lead you to the last relic that I have been seeking. Take this fiery fragment of my soul.  Use it to transform your body into flame and denature your spirit into a vision guide that will shoot forth to reveal the location of the final Thunderlord relic. "
967,Guardian of the Monument,Collect an Apexis Guardian's Head. ,"You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround. These larger apexis monuments function in much the same way, but they take many more apexis shards to activate and require four persons to operate. Of greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use.  These crystal constructs turned on their arakkoan masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la. We would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof. "
968,The Smallest Creatures,Use the Kodohide Drum at the Marmot Den. ,"The ogres, simple as they are, would notice you dispersing this poison throughout their camp. Thus, I will teach you how to enlist the help of one of nature's smallest creatures to do this task. By playing a simple rhythm on this drum, you can coax a marmot to follow your commands. There is a den of marmots near the Bloodmaul camp, to the north, down in the Daggermaw Canyon past the Circle of Blood. Once you have a marmot's aid, use it to disperse the poison to the Bloodmaul's kegs. "
969,A Time for Negotiation. . . ,Negotiate with Overseer Nuaar. ,"When we arrived in the Ruuan Weald, the wyrm cultists were keeping themselves to Blackwing Coven, through the tunnel to the west.  But now, they are encroaching upon us here. I need you to find the wyrmcultists' overseer.  He's known to make a regular patrol between their various camps in the Ruuan Weald. Negotiate with him.  Let him know that there's room for compromise, but that we will not condone or allow the wholesale slaughter of the wildlife, nor the felling of all of the trees. "
970,Whispers of the Raven God,Kill Grishna arakkoa to gain Understanding Ravenspeech for 2 minutes. ,"At Grishnath, totems left by the Oracles of the Raven enable the arakkoa to hear the Word of the Raven. Unfortunately, the language of the arakkoa is indecipherable to us. Using the Harbinger's pendant, we can understand it. You will be able to take the souls of the arakkoa to understand their language. While you are suffused with the arakkoa's spirit, you can visit the totems and understand their message. Discover this for us, <name>. "
971,Bomb Them Again! ,Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks. ,"We're still having problems with those flak cannons, <name>. Don't get me wrong -- I think that you did an outstanding job the last time out -- but, that doesn't change the fact that those damned demons seem to be replenishing their ammo supplies faster than we can knock them out.  And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la. What do you say?  Want to take another shot at it? "
972,A Fel Whip For Gahk,Collect a Fel Whip. ,"Gahk think being smart is dumb sometimes. Gahk not want to think.  Me want little <race> to smash big demons! Dey have some chiefs, and da chiefs all have whips to hurt da little demons.  You bring Gahk a whip! You challenge demon chief in forge camps at burning, green, fel crystal prism.

973,Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger,Collect an Unstable Flask of the Beast. ,"<class>, we've got a problem -- we have lots of sons.  And ever since the Skyguard moved in nearby, all our sons ever talk about is joining their ranks. As a proud father, we want them to have every advantage for when they apply.  So, would you go to the fel crystalforge at either forge camp to the north or south, and procure a magic flask for our sons?  You can't miss their green smoke. We think that they take ten apexis shards to make.  We'd give you the shards, but we don't have any at the moment. "
974,Picking Up Some Power Converters,Use the Protovoltaic Magneto Collector to collect 5 Electromentals. ,"Those dumb ogres at the Bladespire Outpost to the north have been raiding our power converters!  And you're going to get them back for me, sort of. No doubt, with their big, clumsy hands, the ogres have damaged the converters.  So, what I want you to do is release the energy from them and then use this protovoltaic magneto collector on the resultant electromental to encase it. It'll likely be sore with you, so you'll need to 'kill' it while it's contained in the magneto sphere. "
975,You're Fired! ,Slay Doomcryer. ,"Doomcryer did nothing to stop the revolt? How dare she! She has been trying to undermine my authority for some time. However, this time will be her last. You must summon her and deal with her personally. Her anger guards hold the keys that summon her to Forge Camp: Anger. Retrieve the five keys and activate the five Legion obelisks. The obelisks have a short duration, so make sure they are all activated at the same time. Remember, the anger guards carry more keys. "
976,Felsworn Gas Mask,Wear the Felsworn Gas Mask and use the Legion Communicator at Forge Camp: Anger in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"I have a very special mission for you, <name>. I need you to infiltrate Forge Camp: Anger east of here. When you enter the camp you will need to wear the Felsworn gas mask and locate the Legion communicator.

Try telling the demon that Camp Anger has revolted. Good luck to you <class>. "
977,Thunderlord Clan Artifacts,"Collect the Thunderlord Clan Drum, Thunderlord Clan Arrow and the Thunderlord Clan Tablet. ","The artifact bears markings that indicate its origins as being created by the Thunderlord clan orcs.  These orcs used to live at Thunderlord Stronghold before they were changed into fel orcs. For a time the Bladespire ogres inhabited the stronghold until recently when the Horde pushed them out. You've heard of other artifacts that were lost.  A drum, an arrow and a tablet come to mind as objects that you know are being sought after. Find them in Bladespire Hold and return them to Rokgar Bloodgrip. "
978,Stasis Chambers of Bash'ir,Use the Ethereum Key Tablet - Alpha to open Stasis Chamber Alpha at Bash'ir's Landing in Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"The Ethereum have a settlement on the northernmost shelf of Blade's Edge Mountains known as Bash'ir's Landing. According to the key tablet, much larger versions of the prisons are kept at Bash'ir's. It should also be noted that the Ethereum refer to those prisons as stasis chambers. The key tablet grants access to a very specific stasis chamber at the landing known as Stasis Chamber Alpha. Take the key and investigate. My image will be awaiting your return at Bash'ir's Landing. Speak to me there. "
979,A Father's Duty,Collect an Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer for him. ,"As to that other magical flask, it can only be obtained from one spot: Bash'ir Landing.  It's an ethereal base, and they aren't too friendly with outsiders, so it might be a little dangerous to obtain. Where's Bash'ir Landing, you ask?  Well, if you get on your flying steed and head north by northeast, well past Forge Camp: Wrath, you'll eventually spot it.  The Bash'ir crystalforge itself is at the northeast corner of the landing. Thank you for doing this, <name>.  It'll mean the world to our sons! "
980,The Mark of the Nexus-King,The Image of Commander Ameer at Bash'ir's Landing in the Blade's Edge Mountains wants you to bring him a Mark of the Nexus-King. ,"What I must now know is what the Ethereum have held inside the Mana-Tombs of Auchindoun. In your battles against the beasts of the stasis chambers of Bash'ir you may run across an item known as the Mark of the Nexus-King. Should you find such an item, return it to me immediately! It is the final piece in crafting a key that will allow access to the stasis chamber inside the Mana-Tombs. "
981,Creating the Pendant,Collect 6 Ruuan'ok Claws and use them at the Ruaan'ok Oracle Circle to summon a Harbinger of the Raven. ,"The arakkoa of Ruaan Weald elevate from their flock the Harbingers of the Raven, the heralds of their god. They believe that the Harbingers watch over them from the sky, where they receive the teachings of the Raven, and descend to pass this message along. The Harbingers hold a powerful sway over the souls of the arakkoa. They use magical pendants, which we need. Attract one of the Harbingers by slaying its flock and taking their claws. Place the claws upon the altar to get his attention. "
982,Banish the Demons,Use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at Forge Camp: Wrath or Forge Camp: Terror. ,"You've arrived at the perfect time, friend!  We are in need of assistance.  In return, you will receive something very rare, which will help us both in the end. We're not a violent ogre any longer, but the demons nearby threaten to overrun us and the Skyguard.  The problem with demons is that, once killed, they come right back in new bodies! But, if you use this crystal to summon a banishing portal, when they die near it, their essences will be drawn in and banished back from whence they came! "
983,Gauging the Resonant Frequency,"Place the Oscillating Frequency Scanners in such a way that when you stand amongst them, you are hit by 5 overlapping Oscillation fields. ","Take these scanners to the Singing Ridge.  By dropping them in a pattern on the ground, you will create overlapping fields that will read the amplitude of the crystals.  Stand amidst them in such a way that you're in five oscillation fields and I'll have the information that I need! Your scanners will even work with those that others drop. Oh, and it's likely that a rift will be formed!  I have no idea what, if anything, will come out of it, but be prepared for the worst. "
984,Damaged Mask,Deliver the Damaged Mask to O'Mally Zapnabber at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"As you examine the damaged mask, you hear strange sounds coming from within.

985,Mok'Nathal Treats,Collect 3 Raptor Ribs and 3 Serpent Flesh. ,"Hungry, <race>?  The Great Spirit helps those that help themselves.  If you want to earn a meal, I suggest that you listen up, because Braagor there isn't going to give you anything for free, nor as tasty! The raptors and scalewings of Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf have everything that's needed for two of the most delicious dishes you'll ever taste.

986,The Thunderspike,Collect the Thunderspike. ,"If the vision that I granted you is true, then you must travel down into the ravine and to the south end of Bloodmaul Ravine.  There you will find the Draenethyst Mine. Journey to the back of the mine, and retrieve the Thunderspike.  Ignore everything else!  I have no interest in the crystals of the mine, nor the ogres therein. As soon as you have the spear return it to me here! And, <name>, be very careful with it. . . I would hate to think what would happen to you should you break it. "
987,The Trappings of a Vindicator,Collect Vindicator Vuuleen's Blade and Vindicator Vuuleen's Shield. ,"I know it's strange, but I do want to stay in this cage.  It gives me the perfect opportunity to do what I came here for; to gather information on the Bladespire. I can leave at any time, but I would like to have my sword and shield back. Two of their leaders have my trappings.  Droggam has my sword and Mugdorg has my shield. If you have need, obtain and use the brew from Bloodmaul Outpost to the south to thin out their help and entice those two, but beware their sober guards who don't drink! "
988,There Can Be Only One Response,Collect the Collection of Souls. ,"There can be only one response to this. . . this, DEFILEMENT of the souls of our ancestors! <name>, if you would aid us to restore the souls of our honored dead to their rightful place, go back to Razaan's Landing.

989,Into the Soulgrinder,Collect Skulloc's Soul. ,"The grimoire is the key to Skulloc's downfall. Read aloud from the book at Soulgrinder's Barrow to initiate the ritual.  An object known as the Soulgrinder will appear, as well as Skulloc's ghostly victims, who will try to destroy it.  You must keep them from doing so long enough to force Skulloc fully into the world. Find the barrow by heading north through the Daggermaw Canyon on the other side of the Circle of Blood.  It is on the right side before Gruul's Lair. Bring back Skulloc's soul. "
990,Trial and Error,Try out each of Dertrok's wands on an Arakkoa Ogre Slave. ,"I've fashioned four wands that I believe will enhance the power of the arakkoa's crystals. Take these wands to Trogma's Claim, and try them on the ogre slaves. You'll need to find an infused crystal off of the arakkoa in the area. When you figure out which is best, come back to me. "
991,Baron Sablemane's Poison,Deliver Baron Sablemane's Poison to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"Here, take this to your master. I'm sure that whatever the reason, Rexxar will put it to good use. Oh, and do be certain to remind him that he owes me. He knows what I want, and I'm certain that however he intends to obtain it for me, I'll be seeing you again sooner than you think. Now, do be a good little <boy/girl> and run this up to Rexxar. "
992,Planting the Banner,Use the Bladespire Banner atop the Northmaul Tower to lure Gurn Grubnosh. ,"I want you to steal the Bladespire banner from one of their champions and take it south to Bloodmaul Outpost.  Plant it atop their Northmaul Tower. This will infuriate the Bloodmaul and they will attack you relentlessly.  But it will also keep their hatred focused on Bladespire Hold, and away from Sylvanaar. You will know you have accomplished the deed when you have defeated Gurn Grubnosh and taken his helm.  Return it to Sylvanaar. <name>, this isn't going to be easy.  Take a  friend or two with you. "
993,Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater,Collect 3 Grisly Totems from Boulder'mok ogres. ,"We must show the ogres that we are not to be trifled with. We must send a message. Travel to Boulder'mok and kill the ogres there. Make sure you keep their heads. Then go to Gorgrom's altar and place the trap there for him. Gorgrom will appear, and you must lure him into the trap.

994,Grim(oire) Business,Collect Vim'gol's Vile Grimoire. ,"There is one more gronn to be slain: Skulloc Soulgrinder. He keeps himself hidden away, but there is a way to coax him forth. He was trained by an ogre warlock known as Vim'gol the Vile, whose grimoire you must retrieve! Vim'gol must be summoned by standing within a fire ring at his circle. Find Vim'gol's Circle in the mountains, to the northeast, near the Broken Wilds. <name>, if you hear Vim'gol talk about growing bigger, get people back into each of the five fire rings to interrupt his casting! "
995,Fire At Will! ,Use the Naturalized Ammunition to take control of the Death's Door Fel Cannons. ,"Now that the ammunition can affect the Burning Legion, it's time for you to use it. There are two warp-gates, which are used for teleportation and enhancement of the void terrors.  One is in the south and the other in the north, and each is within range of a fel cannon. Use the naturalized ammunition to take control of each fel cannon and destroy the warp-gates. Attack the gate with artillery to begin, and be prepared to kill its defenders to keep the cannon alive if necessary. "
996,To Rule The Skies,Collect Dragon Teeth. ,"As ye've flown around, ye must have noticed the dragons above.  I trust ye haven't fallen victim ta their rage.  Help us put an end ta it, <name>! Rivendark and Obsidia lord over this terrace, while Insidion and Furywing rule the skies over yon terrace ta the northeast.  Each has a perch on their respective domains.  I be wondering if ye and yer friends will go ta one, <lad/lass>, break open an egg and attract the dragon down. Bring me some teeth as proof.  Ta rule the skies, it's either them or us. "
997,Maintaining the Sunwell Portal,Obtain 10 Smuggled Mana Cells and return them to Exarch Nasuun on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City. ,"We must maintain the energy to our portal or it will collapse. The mana cells that the ethereals at Bash'ir Landing have hidden will continue to serve our purposes. The landing sits atop the northwestern corner of the Blade's Edge Mountains, far to the north. Remember, acquire a phase device from one of the ethereals and then use it to locate the smuggled goods. Just be cautious of the phase wyrms that they use to guard the mana cells. "
998,Showdown,"Use Rexxar's Battle Horn at the Altar of Goc, then kill Goc. ","Now it comes to this. We will bring Goc forth from his lair, and we will destroy him. With Goc dead, the Bladespire ogres will threaten the Mok'Nathal no longer. Go to Goc 's altar outside Gruul's Lair, then blow my horn. I will come, and we will face the son of Gruul together. "
999,Cutting Your Teeth,Collect 5 Extra Sharp Daggermaw Teeth. ,"It's nice that you've been helping out Toshley and his scientists.  I, however, do not have the luxury of indulging in my 'personal' interests. If you want to make a difference around here, you'll do what I ask of you, and right now, I need weapons. Our guns are effective at range, but when the bugs get in close, we need to have powerful melee weapons as a backup. The teeth of the daggermaw lashtails in the northern part of the Razor Ridge make for great vibro-weapon blades.  Scare me up some. "
1000,The Stones of Vekh'nir,Collect and use a Vekh'nir Crystal at the Vekh'nir Spell Circle to create a Charged Vekh'nir Crystal. ,"The arakkoa of Vekh'nir have been a thorn in our sides for many years. Some strange religion guides them, a religion which has the arakkoa in a frenzy of activity. They carry these crystals with them now, which they have turned to some dark purpose. I know something of their rituals. They take the crystals to their spell circles to infuse them. We at the village would like to know more. Waylay a few of the arakkoa until you find a crystal, charge it, then return it to me. "
1001,The Truth Unorbed,Deliver the Orb of the Grishna to Tree Warden Chawn at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"This strange, magical orb drops from beneath the contour feathers of the arakkoa. Suffused with an eerie, purple glow, the orb pulses to an unheard beat.  Holding it makes you mildly uncomfortable, and so you quickly place it within your pack. Perhaps Tree Warden Chawn at Ruuan Weald to the west, through the tunnel and across the Wyrmskull Bridge, would be interested in examining it? "
1002,A Date with Dorgok,Slay Dorgok at Bloodmaul Camp. ,"Good, I've seen you around and I've been meaning to speak to you about a matter of some importance. There are reports coming in that for some reason the Bloodmaul ogres are planning an offensive against Sylvanaar and Ruuan Weald.  We don't know who or what is pushing them to do this, but I intend to nip their plan in the bud! Bloodmaul Camp is where the attacks are to be staged from.  Head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald and you will find it.  I want you to kill their leader, Dorgok! "
1003,The Den Mother,Slay Rema. ,"WANTED! Rema, the den mother and primary defender of the Jagged Ridge south of Thunderlord Stronghold.

1004,The Hound-Master,Slay Baelmon the Hound-Master. ,"Baelmon the Hound-Master must die!  He maintains the ritual that keeps the portal functioning. The Death's Door portal is located at the north end of the canyon.  When you find it, you will find Baelmon. You're going to need help on this one, so take this wand.  When you battle the Hound-Master, use it and a couple of my friends will come to your aid. After you have defeated Baelmon, return to Wildlord Antelarion. And, <name>, thank you for all that you've gone through for us here. "
1005,The Crystals,Collect 5 Apexis Shards. ,"When prepared correctly, the crystals of the mountains exhibit strange powers, such as the clarity of mind that we have found here in Ogri'la. All of the creatures atop the mountains covet the crystal shards and use them to further their own goals.  An economy has even sprung up around them. To assist us, you must first learn about the Apexis shards.  Bring me some.  In addition to the creatures here having them, they can sometimes be found where the flayers dig at the larger crystals. "
1006,A Crystalforged Darkrune,Da demons are making da Forge Camp: Wrath bigger. ,"Little <race>, remember, when you control da degrader, you use its hammer ta smash da warp-gate's shield and let loose da demon within. Den you crush dat demon and control it.  Den another demon come and you control it, until da eredar overseer come. Den you crush him too! ! ! "
1007,Prisoner of the Bladespire,Slay Bladespire ogres to get the Wyvern Cage Key. ,"Shortly after my arrival in the mountains, I came under attack by a group of Bladespire ogres. Though I fought free of them, and slew many, they took my wyvern, Leokk, captive. Spirit has found him, locked in a cage in the heart of the Bladespire encampment outside of Gruul's lair. One of the ogres must carry his key. Find it and Spirit can use it to unlock Leokk's cage. You will find the encampment at the north end of the Daggermaw Canyon down below. "
1008,Wyrmskull Watcher,Deliver the Meeting Note to Watcher Moonshade at the entrance of the Wyrmskull Tunnel in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"Hmm, I'm not certain what we should do.  I'm not much of a military planner. Watcher Moonshade will know what to do.  He's heading up our defensive efforts at the Wyrmskull Tunnel to the west at the end of Wyrmskull Bridge.  We have a force out there just in case the cultists try anything funny. Please, take the note to him with all due haste. "
1009,The Encroaching Wilderness,Slay 12 Grovestalker Lynxes. ,"We've been growing the Living Grove at an accelerated rate, but somehow the lynxes there have become lost to our control. Where once their population was stable, the grovestalker lynxes are now beginning to encroach upon Sylvanaar, and there have been a number of unpleasant incidents of late. I suspect that the arakkoa of Veil Lashh are somehow behind it, but the immediate issue is with the lynxes themselves. I would be most grateful if you would help us to deal with this situation. "
1010,Trapping the Light Fantastic,Use the Light Trap to collect 15 Razaani Light Orbs. ,"The Razaani ethereals have been playing with some interesting technology at Razaan's Landing to the north. I'm sure they won't mind if you use this trap to take a few samples of their little pink floating light orbs?  They're probably only for decoration anyway. The trap has a special property to it that when opened should attract one of the floating balls towards it.  Of course, it'll probably also alert the Razaani to your presence. "
1011,Grulloc Has Two Skulls,Collect Grulloc's Dragon Skull. ,"To the east, at the terminus of Dragons' End, is the Cursed Hollow.  Therein, Grulloc, son of Gruul, plots his dimwitted schemes. I heard that one of his possessions was stolen from him through trickery.  Was that you?  Unfortunate that he was not slain in the process. If we are to regain our freedom, I would have you take his most prized possession, a dragon skull from when he rejoiced in his father's slaying of the black dragonflight.  The only way you'll get the skull is to vanquish him. "
1012,Wrangle Some Aether Rays! ,Use the Wrangling Rope to capture 5 Aether Rays. ,"Wanna help the Skyguard and Ogri'la? Just hear me out before you walk away, <hot stuff/girly>.  We're in need of remounts!  The bombing runs and missions to Bash'ir Landing have taken a toll on our mounts. The aether rays that fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast, look like they'd do just fine.  You don't even have to bring them back here, though that would be nice.  Just break and rope them, and we'll track them down later. Think you can wrangle me up some? "
1013,The Skyguard Outpost,Speak with Sky Commander Keller at the Skyguard Outpost in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"<name>, we were wondering if you might be willing to visit our friends just to the north at the Skyguard Outpost? Sky Commander Keller and his Skyguard are here running missions for our mutual protection, and he's asked us to send along anyone that we feel would excel at helping out. That would be you! Head up there as soon as you can, and please, give him our regards. "
1014,Crush the Bloodmaul Camp,Slay 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks. ,"<Tor'chunk leans in close to whisper. ><name>, you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres so far.  And while I have every confidence in what Rexxar has planned, I would still ask that you crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp before returning. That way we'll be doubly certain of the outcome. To get there, head north down the ramp out of Thunderlord.  Then, at the base of the ramp, head west across Dragons' End and north through the Churning Gulch and Daggermaw Canyon. "
1015,On Spirit's Wings,"Find a Bloodmaul Taskmaster and a Bloodmaul Soothsayer engaged in conversation, then use Rexxar's Whistle to summon Spirit to spy on them. ","If the Mok'Nathal are tormented by the Bloodmaul ogres, then I will stop them and their followers. Ogres are simple creatures, and there is little profit they could gain from harassing the Mok'Nathal. There must be something more to this. <name>, take Spirit, my hawk, and spy upon the conversations of the Bloodmaul's leaders. He may go undetected where we cannot. "
1016,Killing the Crawlers,Slay 6 Cavern Crawlers. ,Tor'chunk Twoclaws wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with Swamp Rat. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Tor'chunk Twoclaws at once!

Now it looks like we've finally put down some roots.  All of the crazy scientists have their projects going, and us Roughriders are here to protect them. What we need right now is for you to go north into Razor Ridge, or east to the Scalewing Shelf, and keep them clear by killing the stalkers.  They're stealthy spiders that live amongst the rock outcroppings, and jump unsuspecting passersby. "
1018,Bladespire Kegger,Use the Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg to get 5 Bladespire Ogres drunk. ,"As T'chali was saying, he helped out his Bloodmaul friends to make their brew.  But what T'chali did not say was why. The Bloodmaul are in dire straits.  The Bladespire clan be crushing them, and they needed a new weapon to help out with their fight. That's when T'chali came up with a great idea.  Why not make the perfect brew, one that strengthens you and weakens your enemy?  Only thing is, T'chali does not know if it works. So, you gonna take this brew up to Bladespire Hold and see if it works! "

1020,Spirit Calling,Use the Spirit Calling Totems to collect 8 Lesser Nether Drake Spirits. ,"The spirits of the nether drakes in the Singing Ridge are in need of liberation. The nether drakes were not always nether drakes.  They used to be black drakes. But then, with the destruction of this world, a wave of nether energy washed over everything and had the side-effect of changing the drakeling eggs. Now they are all twisted versions of their former selves.  We must help them to find peace. Do this by slaying a drake near to the spirit calling totem, and then take its spirit from it. "
1021,Protecting Our Own,Use Rina's Bough on 5 of the Grove Seedlings to summon forth defenses for the Living Grove. ,"Though you've done a great deal of good work in defense of our new home here, I still feel that the Living Grove needs more protection. Please, take this small tree bough that I have imbued with the force of nature.  When used upon the seedlings that I have planted out in the grove, it will call down a storm to accelerate the growth of a treant defender. These treants are critical to the defense of the grove, especially if you choose not to make Sylvanaar your home for long. "
1022,Since Time Forgotten. . . ,"Slay Gnosh Brognat, leader of the ogres at the Bladespire Outpost. ","Since time forgotten we have fought with the Bladespire ogres. We have managed to push them back so that now they only hold a tenuous grip at Bladespire Outpost.  It's back the way that you came, on the southwestern edge of the Razor Ridge.

1023,Deceive thy Enemy,Slay 4 Doomforge Attendants and 4 Doomforge Engineers. ,"For every moment I hear silence, you draw closer to your death! SPEAK! What? The camp has revolted?

Every couple o' hours, me aether-techs launch an assault on Bash'ir Landing, far ta the northeast in the Blade's Edge Mountains.  They say that they're there 'studying' the Bash'ir crystalforge, but it's an assault; there be no two ways about it.  We use the crystalforge to resupply, and there's always extra to be sold.

1025,Dust from the Drakes,Collect 4 Dusts of the Fey Drake. ,"The Alliance has recently moved in to the west, using their elven magics to grow a town and grove in a short matter of time.  We must keep their defenses weak so that they do not also grow a spine. I have a plan that will do that and more.  I want you to traverse the bridge to the southwest, which crosses over Bloodmaul Ravine and leads into the Living Grove. Attack their fey drake defenses in the Living Grove and bring back the magical dust that sometimes can be found upon their wings. "
1026,Into the Churning Gulch,Collet 7 Crust Burster Venom Glands. ,"So, your Rexxar would have me fashion a poison for him? I'll give him what he desires, but there will be a price. Even for friends, there must be a price. Free things destroy friendships. First, you must venture a short distance to the southwest to the Churning Gulch. Therein mill some of the most poisonous creatures in all of Outland, or anywhere. I speak of the crust bursters, and this poison will require gathering their glands for me. "
1027,Showdown,"Use Sablemane's Signet at the Altar of Goc, then kill Goc. ","The time has come for us to face Goc, the master of the Bladespire ogres. It is also time that I take a hand in events, to see the last of the gronn's life. Take my signet ring. When you come to the Altar of Goc, use it, and I will come to join you. Together we will destroy Goc. "
1028,Treebole Must Know,"Speak with Treebole, an ancient of lore who lives in the Raven's Wood of the Blade's Edge Mountains. ","This is troubling!  The arakkoa are causing the ancients and protectors to become possessed by evil spirits! But, there is one ancient that could not possibly have been affected.  His name is Treebole, and you must go to him at once if we're to save the trees of the Raven's Wood! Go back to the Raven's Wood.  You will find him at the fork in the path just past Grishnath. "
1029,Even Gronn Have Standards,Collect Slaag's Standard. ,"Are you familiar with Shattrath City, <class>?  Above it to the northwest is a place called the Barrier Hills, which you can only get to upon a flying mount. One of Gruul's sons, Slaag, exiled himself and took control of the Gordunni ogres that reside there.  Even at such a distance, we cannot afford to leave him in peace, lest he return when the rest of his brothers have been slain. <name>, you must travel there, and bring back his standard as proof that he has been dealt with. "
1030,Bombing Run,Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks. ,"You have a flying mount. . . so what!  You think you have what it takes to use it properly? Forge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la.  With all of those fel cannons shooting down the Skyguard left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business. You want to prove yourself?  Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks.  Just don't let them shoot you down, too! "
1031,Meeting at the Blackwing Coven,Collect enough Costume Scraps from wyrmcultists to create an Overseer Disguise. ,"I know what must be done!  <name>, you must pose as Overseer Nuaar and attend that meeting! The wyrmcultists at the coven all have a standard outfit that they wear, so go collect scraps from them, and when you have enough, put together a disguise. Pose as Overseer Nuuar and speak with Kolphis Darkscale to see what he has to say, and then return to Tree Warden Chawn. You'll find the coven by heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel and following the path past the Raven's Wood and Grishnath to its end. "
1032,Whelps of the Wyrmcult,Use the Blackwhelp Net to capture 10 Wyrmcult Blackwhelps. ,"I need to examine the whelps that they are raising at the Blackwing Coven. There should be an abundance of them flying around inside their cavernous base, as well as a number of eggs, which if you get close to them will likely hatch. Please, <name>, take the net and capture a handful of them alive for me. Find them by heading west across the Wyrmskull Bridge and heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel.  Follow the path to its end past Grishnath and the Raven's Wood. "
1033,"Goodnight, Gronn",Collect Grulloc's Sack. ,"I've outdone myself again.  I've fashioned a sleeping powder for you to use on Grulloc, the gronn I spoke of who is guarding what I want. Grulloc keeps himself at the Cursed Hollow, an area at the eastern edge of Dragons' End on the other side of the Circle of Blood. If I were you, I wouldn't tarry long once you have his sack.  The effects of the dust won't last long. "
1034,Ride the Lightning,Use the Repolarized Magneto Sphere to absorb 25 lightning strikes from the Scalewing Serpents. ,"We haven't kept the use of the Zephyrium Capacitorium under budget.  But, it occurs to me that the serpents of the Scalewing Shelf to the east have a lightning breath and glands that we can make use of. I've repolarized the magneto collector to absorb lightning strikes and I want you to head up there, activate it on yourself, and get us some cheap fuel from those serpents. "
1035,Test Flight: The Zephyrium Capacitorium,Speak with Rally Zapnabber and use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. ,"I built an amazing device, the Zephyrium Capacitorium, and I'm sure it'll work perfectly, but. . . do you want to help me test it? There's plenty of hazard pay! Speak with my twin over there, Rally. Good luck, <name>. Come back after your experiment.  Or. . . if that's not possible due to sustained injuries, your next of kin can report to collect your pay. "
1036,Test Flight: The Singing Ridge,"Sign Tally's Waiver, then speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. ","I've been fiddling with the Zephyrium Capicitorium and I'm ready to perform another test!  Do you want to help? This next flight should be short, but fast! Um. . . and although I'm sure there's no danger. . . I have this, uh, waiver that I'd like  you to sign.  It's just a formality, I assure you! Best of luck!  Talk to Rally to launch yourself, and come back to me after the experiment is over! "
1037,The Totems of My Enemy,Collect 5 Bladespire Totems. ,"There is the right way to honor one's ancestors, and there is the wrong way. The Bladespire ogres carry totems with them, but they do not use them to show their respect.  Instead, they seek to use them to manipulate and control. We should steal their totems because they are unworthy!  We will then put them to better use. Go to the Bladespire Outpost to the west, just southwest of the Razor Ridge.  Slay the Bladespire mystics and crushers, and take their totems from them! "
1038,Intercepting the Mana Cells,Obtain 10 Smuggled Mana Cells and return them to Exarch Nasuun on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City. ,"I have devised a plan to acquire a power source strong enough for the creation of our portal. The ethereal forces at Bash'ir Landing, atop the northwestern Blade's Edge Mountains, have been smuggling mana cells out of Tempest Keep and transporting them to the Sunwell for Kael'thas. They have hidden the cells, but there is a way for you to find them; the ethereal carry phase devices that you can use to see the smuggled goods. Just beware the mana cells' phase wyrm guardians. "
1039,Test Flight: Ruuan Weald,Speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. ,"Hey, <name>.  I'm glad I caught you!  I have a very important mission! Here is a nether-weather vane.  I need you to take some in flight readings for me and deliver them to my cousin in Ruuan Weald. Speak with Rally and take a Zephyrium Capacitorium flight to Ruuan Weald.  While you're flying, spin the vane! After you land, bring the spinning vane to O'Mally Zabnabber. Good luck, <name>.  And don't delay! "

1041,Maxnar Must Die! ,Slay Maxnar the Ashmaw. ,"They've left us no choice, <name>.  It's time to put an end to the threat from the Blackwing Coven by taking out their leader, Maxnar the Ashmaw. I don't know if you caught a glimpse of him while you were in there, but he's one of the dragonkin, half-man, half-dragon.  And he's tough, so don't underestimate him! Finish it quickly and with any luck you'll secure the safety of Evergrove and the Ruuan Weald. "
1042,A Curse Upon Both of Your Clans! ,Use the Wicked Strong Fetish to curse 5 buildings or towers in Bladespire Hold and 2 in Bloodmaul Outpost. ,"T'chali wants revenge on all of the ogres! T'chali was a powerful witch doctor in life.  If you reach into me grave you will find a wicked strong fetish. Invoke the fetish's magic at the entrances to the buildings and towers of both Bladespire Hold and Bloodmaul Outpost.  The voodoo you work will summon an evil spirit that you must defeat.  This in turn will curse that building. Beware, if you attempt to curse a building that is already cursed, you will call down another cursed spirit! "
1043,Wrangle More Aether Rays! ,Use the Wrangling Rope to capture 5 Aether Rays. ,"So, I hope that you're up to helping us wrangle up even more aether rays!  From what I can see, you're a natural with the rope!  And it's for a good cause, because not only do we get fresh mounts, but it helps us to protect Ogri'la, which the ogres appreciate. Remember, the aether rays fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast. Think you can wrangle me up some more? "
1044,. . . and a Time for Action,Slay 10 Wyrmcult Hewers. ,"We will not stand idly by while they decimate the Ruuan Weald around us.  Our first priority must be to the trees. <class>, I want you to go back out into the Weald and deliver a very different message for us.  I want you to slay every one of their hewers that you come into contact with! If they will not listen to reason, perhaps they will listen to a more assertive method of persuasion! "
1045,Into the Churning Gulch,Collect 7 Crust Burster Venom Glands. ,"Very well, I'll create this trap, but first I want something in return. There happens to be a nearby gronn that is in possession of an item that I want, but you can't face him, not yet anyway. So, you and I are going to fashion a sleeping powder from the poison of the nearby crust bursters. You'll find them in the Churning Gulch to the southwest.  Bring me a number of their glands, and be quick about it! "
1046,The Softest Wings,Collect 12 Iridescent Wings. ,"Hunting silkwing larva is a difficult challenge for our young warriors, but luckily, even if they fail to harvest the cocoon from the larva, we can still use the wings of hatched silkwings. In fact, we use the wings for much more than the cocoons, and we can never have too many. If you'll be out there, it would be a great help if you could bring me some. "
1047,More than a Pound of Flesh,Collect 5 Ether-Energized Flesh. ,"<name>, I've got something else for you to do.  One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at Razaan's Landing, north of the Razor Ridge. More to the point, they want to study the flesh of the flesh beasts that are there. <Dizzy makes a disgusted face. >But, of course, they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, and they only want the ether-energized flesh, which it's not likely that all of them have. I say, beggars can't be choosers, but what can you do? "
1048,Understanding the Mok'Nathal,"Slay Vekh, leader of the Vekh'nir arakkoa. ","< Leoroxx looks you in the eye with the kind of stare that chills your soul. >You come to the Mok'Nathal, but you do not understand us.  You do not understand our struggle to survive. If you would understand us, then you will have to endure a taste of that struggle. To the south are the Vekh 'nir arakkoa.  They have enslaved a group of ogres in the caverns known as Trogma's Claim and their leader, Vekh is in there. Slay him! "
1049,Mog'dorg the Wizened,"Speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower where Chort is standing, just outside the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ","Mog'dorg the Wizened waits for you at top of da tower.  He tells me to look for a <race> <class> just like you.  You go speak with him about smart things. Go now, but don't tell no one.  It's a secret! "
1050,Follow the Breadcrumbs,Follow the trail of spare parts up the ramp to the Razor Ridge. ,"VERY WELL, I AM HEREBY WARNING YOU THAT YOU WILL FIND NOTHING UP ON THE RIDGE.

1051,Favor of the Gronn,Deliver Gorgrom's Favor to Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"A token in the form of a small statuette falls from Dorgok's dead clutch.  It bears a striking resemblance to one of the gronn. Surely, Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Ruuan Weald, up the ramp to the east, would be interested in this! "
1052,The Spirits Have Voices,Speak with Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"<name>, now that you can see me, there is something you must tell Rexxar. I know that he seeks his people, and I know where they are. The Mok'Nathal, as they are known, have a village to the east beyond the Razor Ridge. Go, give Rexxar this news. His people are in danger, and I know that he will want to come to their aid. "
1053,"Grimnok and Korgaah, I Am For You! ",Slay Grimnok Battleborn and Korgaah. ,"T'chali has been waiting for his revenge! The day they bury T'chali and leave him to die, it was Grimnok Battleborn that led them.  And the next day it was Korgaah that come south to raid and kick T'chali in the head. I want them dead! You will find Grimnok atop the Southmaul Tower in Bloodmaul Outpost.  You will find Korgaah in the top of a building at the north end of Bladespire Hold. Korgaah has sober defenders, so use the brew to distract him away from them, because they won't drink. "
1054,Mystery Mask,Deliver the Mystery Mask to Wildlord Antelarion at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"Ok, it should work now. What is it, you ask? Why, it's a communication device - it allows those blockheads to communicate with each other. You know, the Burning Legion! I would suggest that you hand this mask to Wildlord Antelarion. He's over there pacing around. Always moving, he is. Well get moving, he's been trying to get his hands on one of these for sometime now. "
1055,Killing the Crawlers,Slay 6 Cavern Crawlers. ,Commander Skyshadow wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with the Harborage. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Commander Skyshadow at once! 
1056,The Apprentice's Request,Speak with Dama Wildmane at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"As an apprentice wind rider master, one of my tasks is to care for the beasts when they're not flying. The problem is that we have so few here, there's very little downtime for any of them. I'm afraid we'll work them all to death if we don't receive any replacements. There's a large stable down in Shadowmoon Village, in western Shadowmoon Valley. Dama Wildmane oversees the wind rider care and training there. Would you speak with her on our behalf and let her know about our situation? "
1057,Silkwing Cocoons,Collect 8 Silkwing Cocoons from Silkwing Larva. ,"The silk from the cocoons of the silkwings are used for all manner of things in the village. We can never get enough, and we never have enough. It is difficult to harvest the cocoons from the larva once they begin the process of metamorphosis. Our warriors are occupied with the assault on our village. If you could gather these for us, that would be helpful. "
1058,Bombing Run,Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks. ,"You can fly around as a crow. . . so what!  Ever annihilate something on the ground while you were flying?  Want to? Forge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la.  With all of those fel cannons shooting down the Skyguard left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business. Want to prove yourself?  Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks.  Just don't let them shoot you down, too! "
1059,The Ogre Threat,Travel to Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains and speak with Nekthar. ,"As if the naga and their allies weren't enough, the ogres are extending their reach in the marsh. They've already conquered most of the area to the northwest and there isn't much of a buffer left. For each one we kill, several more take their place. I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold Zabra'jin once they decide to attack. Make your way north into the mountains, to the orcish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Nekthar know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome. "
1060,Ogre Heaven,Speak with Chu'a'lor at Ogri'la in the Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"Now that you have delivered us from bondage, we can begin the process of reunifying the clans.  This will take some time; old grudges are difficult to overcome. But more pressing, you must go to Ogri'la in the heavens above to the west.  You must defend it, and us, from those forces above that the gronn used to protect us from: ethereals, demons, and worst of all, the black dragonflight. When you find ogre heaven, seek out the wisdom of Chu'a'lor on how best to proceed. "
1061,Out of This World Produce! ,Bring the Preserved Fruit to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"I'll be the first to admit I'm not quite sure what this order is for, but Rocket-Chief Fuselage 's instructions were very specific -- only the very best fruit, preserved to survive a long voyage and sealed against the elements. There were other specifications, zero-gravity this and low pressure that. I don't pretend to understand it, but the price is right, so he'll get his superfood. Bring this crate to him up at Area 52. After crossing into Netherstorm, keep following the road until you see the town. "
1062,Arelion's Mistress,Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch wants you to lure Viera Sunwhisper away from the settlement and then use Carinda's Scroll of Retribution on her. ,"With all the important matters at hand Arelion still found time in his schedule to see a mistress! It's all becoming perfectly clear. Viera Sunwhisper, that filthy wench. . . we'll show her to never cross a magistrix again. Take this scroll and find Viera.  Find a way to lure her away from town and use the scroll on her. Arelion mentioned she couldn't resist a particular wine harvested by the cenarion druids.  You might find some at Cenarion Refuge, just inside Zangarmarsh, west of here. "
1063,The Foot of the Citadel,"Kill Force Commander Gorax, place the Challenge From the Horde upon his corpse, kill The Hand of Kargath, and then bring the Head of the Hand of Kargath to Nazgrel in Thrallmar. ","Force Commander Gorax is training Shattered Hand captains at the base of Hellfire Citadel, honing them to a bloody razor's edge.  You must kill him, <name>, for his loss would be a mighty blow to the fel orcs. However, that is not all you must do. Take this banner.  Place it atop Gorax's corpse.  Gorax's commander, the Hand of Kargath, must answer your challenge if he has even a drop of true orc blood within him! His head, the head of the hand of Kargath, is what I seek. "
1064,A Spirit Guide,Use the Wolf Totem at the location where you found Krun Spinebreaker's body and follow the Ancestral Spirit Wolf. ,"Even our best tracking wolves' senses can fail them, <name>.  The spirits have a way of seeing the world differently than ours.  The being you will call forth will find the person you seek, for they'll be drawn not to their scent but their essence. Go now, <class>, take this totem with you and use it at the location you found the stone axe. "
1065,Zeth'Gor Must Burn! ,"Kill Bleeding Hollow Peons for their torches, ignite them at Zeth'Gor's forge then throw the burning torches at Zeth'Gor Buildings. ","The Bleeding Hollow clan have betrayed their noble heritage!  We, the orcs who fought and died to save ourselves from the fel taint of Mannoroth, look upon our vile cousins and see only weakness and ignobility. . . and for that, they must burn! Enter Zeth'Gor, their bastion to the east, and burn their buildings.  Kill peons for their torches, ignite them at their forge, and hurl the burning torches at their hovels, their stable and their barracks.  Burn them all, and then return to me! For the Horde! "
1066,Cruel's Intentions,"Kill Arazzius the Cruel, then return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar. ","Magister Bloodhawk finally deciphered the Legion missive you found earlier. It turned out to be attack plans sent by one of Highlord Kazzak's lieutenants - Arazzius the Cruel. Apparently, Arazzius commands the Legion ground forces in Hellfire. The time has come to terminate his command, <name>. Terminate with extreme prejudice. Head west to the Pools of Aggonar and put an end to this so-called 'Legion lord'. Today, the Horde reclaims Hellfire Peninsula. Let the Legion be damned. "
1067,Arelion's Secret,"Magistrix Carinda wants you to interrogate Magister Aledis, last seen traveling from Falcon Watch to Zangarmarsh. ","Arelion's journal does not deal with any sort of scholarly studies.  It details his escapades with a young female blood elf!  How could I've been such a fool? Unfortunately, the floozy's identity is not revealed in this journal.  Aledis, a colleague of Arelion's, was his best friend and confidant.  Go question him and find out who he was having this affair with. I saw Aledis leave Falcon Watch for Zangarmarsh.  Follow the road headed north from town; it'll eventually lead west, toward Zangarmarsh. "
1068,Overlord,Slay Arazzius the Cruel in the Pools of Aggonar and return to Force Commander Danath Trollbane in the keep of Honor Hold. ,"The honorable Warp-Scryer has told me of your perils, <name> - and of the new foe you've discovered. If Kryv is to be believed, this ' Arazzius the Cruel ' is as powerful and evil as any foe the Sons of Lothar have ever faced. Will you stand for us now, <name>? Will you face this Legionlord and deliver the Light's justice upon him? If so, you will find him at the Pools of Aggonar. If not, his evil will most certainly find you. "
1069,Smooth as Butter,Bring 12 Plump Buzzard Wings to Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash. ,"Screed likes to say his flying is as ""smooth as butter. "" I think ""butterfingered"" is more like it! Take a look at the wreckage over there. He calls it a ""rough"" landing. Sure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often! I think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the Valley of Bones, you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs. "
1070,Hotter than Hell,Destroy a Fel Reaver in Hellfire Peninsula and plunge the Unfired Key Mold into its remains. ,"It's not working, <lad/lass>.  I cannot give it enough heat. . . the materials will not be properly tempered. You know, the Fel Reavers used by the Burning Legion are powered by a scalding core of fel fire - it burns much hotter than normal fire. If you could find enough people to take one down, you could heat the mold in the insides of the fallen reaver.  Beware, <class>, those fel reavers pack quite a punch. "
1071,Avruu's Orb,Take Avruu's Orb to the Haal'eshi Altar southeast of the Den of Haal'esh in Hellfire Peninsula and give it to Aeranas once he's free. ,"<As you hold the orb closer to you, you hear a voice address you. >I sense you're not of the arakkoa, so I will attempt to barter for my freedom.  My name is Aeranas. I once ruled over the eastern winds.  The Haal'eshi mage, Avruu, trapped me inside this orb. Find the altar the arakkoa used to enslave me.  It is hidden to the southeast of the arakkoa's den.  Approach it with the orb and give it to me once I'm free.  In exchange for my liberty I'll reward you with powerful treasure! "
1072,Gaining Mirren's Trust,Mirren Longbeard wants you to bring him 1 Nethergarde Bitter. ,"So you want to gain our trust?  I don't trust many people these days. We lost one of our own not long ago to the arakkoa.  It's got me a bit on edge. Tell you what, if you can prove your loyalty to Honor Hold and. . . bring me a mug of Nethergarde Bitter. . . yes, that sounds rather good about now. . . I'll have a deal to offer you then. Bernie at Nethergarde Keep keeps the bitter in stock. "
1073,Colossal Menace,Slay 5 Raging Colossi and then return to Tola'thion at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"You see that huge red crystal to the north?  It fell from the sky not long ago, causing a massive earthquake. When we came out here to investigate the disturbance, we found all of these colossi wandering about that weren't previously here. There's definitely something strange about that crystal and the energies that it's emanating, but I don't have time for that.  Those mountain giants are my immediate concern. I want you to head up to Fallen Sky Ridge with some friends and deal with them. "
1074,Through the Dark Portal,Travel through the Dark Portal and find Lieutenant General Orion. ,"For years the Dark Portal loomed silent. . . forgotten.  But it is silent no longer. After stopping the demonic assault here, our forces breached the portal and met the demons on their own ground! Now, we are locked in a savage war, and there are some who think we might not win.  So it is our duty, our grim pleasure, to battle the fiends of Outland and ensure our victory, <name>. If you would help us, then report to Lieutenant General Orion at once. He awaits you in the Outland. . . "
1075,Disrupt Their Reinforcements,Defeat enemies around Portal Xilus and Portal Kruul to gather Demonic Rune Stones. ,"Directly east of here is the Legion Front.  Spaced across the front are infernal portals and gateways, used to bring reinforcements to Hellfire Peninsula and throughout Outland. We're going to destroy those portals! Take these primers.  Designed in Area 52, they use the demons' own power as an explosive!  Defeat Legion forces around Portals Xilus and Kruul to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate four stones inside the portals, and watch!  Return to me when your mission is complete. "
1076,Cleansing the Waters,Amaan the Wise wants you to travel to the Pools of Aggonar and use the Cleansing Vial at Aggonar's corpse. ,"I must ask that you finish what we've set in motion.  Now that the demonic influence has weakened you must take this cleansing vial and pour it at the very source of the taint - Aggonar's own corpse. You will find the demon's bones at the northern end of the pools.  Beware, I sense that Aggonar's essence has not quite left this world. "
1077,Boiling Blood,Use Bleeding Hollow Blood at the Cursed Cauldron to make Boiled Blood. ,"That last experiment was not a complete loss -- I did save a small bit of the blood you brought me.  Now boiled down, it should be free of whatever curses the Bleeding Hollow witches placed on their people's blood. I need more for study.  Go gather Bleeding Hollow blood from the orcs in Zeth'Gor.  When you've gathered the blood, bring it to their cursed cauldron and boil it.  Bring me the boiled blood. "
1078,Hotter than Hell,Destroy a Fel Reaver in Hellfire Peninsula and plunge the Unfired Key Mold into its remains. ,"It's no good, <name>!  No matter how many coals I put to the fire, it's just not enough heat. There's only one thing I can think of that is hot enough to temper this key and it is the insides of the Legion's fel reavers. I've only ever seen one downed once.  I remember seeing its insides fuming, shooting fire and steam as it fell.  Take this mold and plunge it into a fallen fel reaver.  I recommend you get yourself some friends if you plan to take one down. "
1079,Hellfire Fortifications,"Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Battlecryer Blackeye in Thrallmar. ","The fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel must be scoured from our birthland!  To attack them, we must first secure forward staging points near the Citadel. Our outrunners found three fortifications that will suit this purpose, but the Alliance has the same idea and even now sends forces to take them! We want you to stop the Alliance and capture these forts.  Aid in the capture of each fort and then return to me. For the Horde! "
1080,The Assassin,Nazgrel wants you to travel to the road north of Hellfire Citadel and look for an assassin named Krun Spinebreaker. ,"<name>, we recently uncovered a plot to assassinate our envoy to Falcon Watch.  Hellfire Citadel learned of our plans to send an expedition there earlier this morning and set up an ambush. Our scouts have informed me that an assassin known as Krun Spinebreaker waits along the road north of the Citadel.  Go there and slay this assassin.  Show the fel orcs we're not to be trifled with! "

1082,Shizz Work,Use the Felhound Whistle to summon a Fel Guard Hound. ,"I finally got my shredder working but I seem to have lost the keys.  I keep a pack of felhounds to protect my camp.  They don't do a very good job and they like to bite me a lot.  They also like shiny things.  I think this one felhound I have may have eaten my shredder keys.  I'll pay you if you'll take my felhound on a walk.  Kill some helboars and let him eat.  He'll do his business.  When he's done, see if you can't find the keys in his ""leavings. """
1083,Entry Into the Citadel,"Entry Into the Citadel is a dungeon quest with objectives in Hellfire Peninsula, and is the first quest in a questline that eventually grants the Shattered Halls Key, allowing players to unlock the gates leading to The Shattered Halls dungeon. ","This freshly cast mold was to be used to create a key of some sort.  From the image engraved on its back, it appears to be related to Hellfire Citadel. Maybe this could prove to interest to Nazgrel, the leader of the Horde's forces in Thrallmar. "
1084,The Demoniac Scryer,"Use the Demoniac Scryer in Hellfire Basin, wait for it to attune, and then take a reading. ","The Demoniac Scryer is now ready.  Take it behind Hellfire Citadel, to Hellfire Basin, and summon it upon the ground.  It will then begin to attune itself to Hellfire Citadel.  After its attunement, speak to the Scryer and transcribe what it tells you.  Bring that transcription to me. . . Go, <name>, but only when you are ready.  There is no doubt that Hellfire Citadel will detect the Scryer and send wardens to destroy it! "
1085,Digging for Prayer Beads,Recover the Draenei Prayer Beads and bring them to Assistant Klatu in Honor Hold. ,"Anchorite Barada plans to exorcise the corruption from Colonel Jules, and will require an assistant for the task.  Such an assistant must be prepared. . . I am ashamed to admit that my prayer beads were lost in Honor Hold's courtyard.  I believe the dog Fei Fei stole them and buried them, but I do not know where.  If you speak with his master, Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell, perhaps she will know where Fei Fei hides his stolen treasures. "
1086,Natural Remedies,Use the Seed of Revitalization at the Earthbinder's Circle to heal the land around the crystal. ,"It must be that the evil emanations from that giant crystal are summoning the mountain giants and driving them insane. It's too big to move, and beyond our ability to destroy, but I know a way to quell its power. I've summoned a circle at the northwest corner of the crystal on the ridge.  Take this seed to the circle and channel its powers to heal the land through the natural forces of rain, growth and insect repopulation. Beware, <name>, I sense an external force at play here. . . this is not natural! "
1087,Drill the Drillmaster,Force Commander Danath Trollbane has ordered you to kill Drillmaster Zurok with all due haste. ,"I'm receiving reports that the Shattered Hand fel orcs, out in front of Hellfire Citadel, are organizing for what looks like an all-out assault.  No doubt, they're not happy about your successes against all of the clans. Get to the base of the citadel, where the Path of Glory ends.  You'll find the fel orcs busy with their preparations, but you're going to catch them with their pants down. Eliminate the one that's in charge of that force.  Kill Drillmaster Zurok! "

We, <name>, are going to destroy those portals! Take this primer.  Designed in Area 52, it uses the demons' own power as an explosive device!  Defeat Legion forces around Portals Grimh and Kaalez to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals. . . then watch the fireworks! ! Go, <name>, and return to me when your mission is complete. "

1092,Birds of a Feather,Travel to the Den of Haal'esh in Hellfire Peninsula and search the Kaliri Nests for a Female Kaliri Hatchling. ,"The Haal'eshi arakkoa have domesticated a beautiful bird species called the kaliri. I've managed to capture a young male and they appear to be trainable.  The females are much rarer, but if I had one I could attempt to breed them.  She has to be young, though. . . a hatchling.  An older wild bird wouldn't survive in captivity. Take this cage and travel south, to the Den of Haal'esh.  Search the nests for eggs that are ready to hatch.  If you bring me back a female hatchling, I'll reward you handsomely. "
1093,Envoy to the Mag'har,Thrall wants you to return to Gorkan Bloodfist at Mag'har Post in Hellfire Peninsula and offer him your services. ,"I'd leave for Outland this very minute after hearing the news you brought.  Important matters require my attention in Durotar, however. I will arrange for a fitting tribute to be sent to the Mag'har immediately.  I will send my most trusted diplomats as well.  This will all take time. . . I need someone to represent us there right now. I must place my trust on you, <name>.  Go to the Mag'har Post in Hellfire and render whatever services you can to my kin.  Do not fail me, <name>.  Too much depends on this. "
1094,Entry Into the Citadel,"Entry Into the Citadel is a dungeon quest with objectives in Hellfire Peninsula, and is the first quest in a questline that eventually grants the Shattered Halls Key, allowing players to unlock the gates leading to The Shattered Halls dungeon. ","This freshly cast mold was to be used to create a key of some sort.  From the image engraved on its back, it appears to be related to Hellfire Citadel. Maybe this could prove to interest to Danath, the force commander at Honor Hold. "
1095,Blast the Gateway,Magistrix Seyla at the Throne of Kil'jaeden wants you to use the Sizzling Embers to summon a Living Flare and slay Incandescent Fel Sparks near it until it becomes an Unstable Living Flare. ,"We have to shut down this gateway to stop Legion reinforcements to the Isle of Quel'Danas. Take these embers, they contain one of my creations: a living flare.  It is designed to act as a powerful destructive force - as long as it has been provided enough energy. Find the fel sparks that wander the area and slay them near the living flare.  The flare will grow in power each time, until it becomes unstable. Once you've achieved this bring the flare to the gateway.  It will know what to do. "
1096,The Eyes of Grillok,"Use Zezzak's Shard to capture an Eye of Grillok, then approach Zezzak's cauldron to extract it.

1098,Dark Tidings,Dark Tidings is a dungeon quest with objectives in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"Giving the lifeless form of Vazruden the Herald the once-over, you discover a rolled letter, its seal yet unbroken.  An elaborate ""I"" is pressed within the blood-red ink.  Cracking the note open, the message that you read is most disturbing. Force Commander Danath Trollbane back at Honor Hold will definitely want to take a look at this! "
1099,Mission: Gateways Murketh and Shaadraz,"Speak with Wing Commander Brack, bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to Forward Commander To'arch at Reaver's Fall. ","We've identified the two main transporters that the Burning Legion are using to bring in reinforcements: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz. If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road.  I want you to bomb them both into oblivion! Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52.  Now, speak with Wing Commander Brack -- he'll put you on a wyvern. "
1100,A Strange Weapon,Bring the Heavy Stone Axe to Nazgrel in Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"You pull the stone axe out of the body to examine it more closely.  There's something unusual about the craftsmanship of the weapon. Its origin appears orcish, though the materials aren't like anything you've seen before. Nazgrel might be interested in seeing the weapon. "
1101,Makuru's Vengeance,Makuru at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 10 Mag'har Ancestral Beads. ,"Sedai was like a brother to Makuru.   We owe him our lives and more!  They call Makuru crazy but if the Omenai are not going to do anything about his death then they're the crazy ones! Makuru doesn't have much to call his own in this world, but he will give you his only possession if you avenge Sedai. I've seen the brown orc Mag'har grunts before, up in the hills to the northeast.  They hate us!  They don't deserve our mercy!  Go, avenge Sedai!  Bring me their ancestral beads as proof! "
1102,Missing Missive,"Return the Eroded Leather Case to Thiah Redmane, camped near the Ruins of Sha'naar in western Hellfire Peninsula. ","Upon examining the battered leather case, it becomes apparent that the container's damage must've been caused by the caustic fluid of the worm's digestive tract. The leather appears to have been intricately tooled at one time, but the details of its adornment can no longer be made out. The only recognizable feature of the case is a worn logo of the Cenarion Circle. Knowing nothing about the contents of the case, you decide the best course of action would be to deliver it to a Circle member. "
1103,Source of the Corruption,Travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar in Hellfire Peninsula and obtain 5 Demonic Essences from the Illidari Taskmasters. ,"Uncorrupted draenei, like this unlucky fellow here, are virtuous champions of the Light.  What corruption caused their great race to devolve into the Broken and Lost Ones? I've heard a theory that exposure to fel energies is what caused the mutation.  I would like to put that theory to the test. Northwest of here lie the Ruins of Sha'naar.  There you will find lowly Broken commanded by Illidari taskmasters.  Bring me demonic essences from the taskmasters so that I can test them on this draenei. "
1104,Cannons of Rage,Destroy 3 Fel Cannon MKIs in Forge Camp: Rage and return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar. ,"There is a second production facility, Forge Camp: Rage, that lies to the immediate northeast of Thrallmar. The demons have positioned a number of their fel cannons along the ridge - and they're aimed straight at us!

1105,Hellfire Fortifications,"Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell in Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula. ","The Hellfire Citadel wages constant battles with our forces.  We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them.  To do that, we need forward staging areas. Our scouts identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel.  We want you to help secure these forts.  Capture each fort, and then report back to me. May fortune shine upon you in the conflicts ahead, <name>, for you will no doubt clash with Horde forces eager to gain these same fortifications. "
1106,The Mag'har,Deliver the Letter from the Mag'har to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"This news you bring from beyond the Dark Portal. . .  you want us to believe the son of Durotan now rules over the lands beyond it. . . free from any demonic taint?  And that now his people have returned to this world? I hope for your sake that this isn't some manner of joke, <class>.  What this means to my people. . . cannot be described.  I must send word to Nagrand at once!  Hellscream must hear about this. Take this letter back to your leader in Thrallmar.  Tell him the Mag'har welcome them! "
1107,Beneath Thrallmar,Kill Urga'zz and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar. ,I'm almost back in business.  Problem is all these gan'arg are in my mine.  I can't send my peons in and even once I fix this shredder I wouldn't want to risk it in combat. Deep down in the mine the gan'arg have a leader.  If you kill him maybe the gan'arg will leave.  Then I could make some money and buy my way out of here. 
1108,Messenger to Thrall,Travel to Orgrimmar and give Thrall the Letter from Nazgrel. ,"The warchief has been waiting for word of this ever since we set foot on Outland.  Now you get the honor of giving him the news of the Mag'har yourself. Go quickly, <name>.  Take this letter with you; it bears my personal seal.  There is nothing that Thrall wants to hear more than the message you bear. "
1109,Felspark Ravine,Felspark Ravine is a quest with objectives in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground. They have stationed dreadlords in Felspark Ravine, east of here. They are responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion. "
1110,Life's Finer Pleasures,Just because we're on this pilgrimage doesn't mean we have to give up all of life's pleasures. ,"You know, maybe we can become friends after all.  Follow me; we don't want to have to share this with the others now, do we? See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(9483))"
1111,In Need of Felblood,Ryathen the Somber at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 6 Felblood Samples from the Terrorfiends that inhabit the Pools of Aggonar. ,"Northeast of here lie the Pools of Aggonar.  Once a sacred site to the draenei, their waters were corrupted after the blood from the demon Aggonar was spilled into them. That blood, though old and diluted, still possesses tremendous power.  Terrorfiends now walk the area, empowered by the pure demonic energies of the original blood.  Slay them and retrieve as much felblood as you can.  I'll make it worth your while. "
1112,Arelion's Journal,Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to go to the Pools of Aggonar and retrieve Arelion's Journal. ,"My husband, Arelion, had been fascinated with the Pools of Aggonar ever since we arrived in Outland.  He spent much of his time studying slimes, of all things! He went missing in there a few days ago.  They say he's dead and there's nothing I can do about it. One thing I can do is try to ensure that his research doesn't die with him.  Go northeast to the pools and look for his journal.  He always carried it inside a brown knapsack. "
1113,Helping the Cenarion Post,Falconer Drenna Riverwind wants you to offer your services to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"<class>, there's some tauren by the name of Thiah Redmane that keeps pestering us for assistance.  She's with the Cenarion Expedition, and they've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the the road leading to Zangarmarsh. If you hit Thornfang Hill, you've gone too far. Do you think you might head over there and see what she needs?  I don't want to have to bother Ranger Captain Venn'ren with such trivialities. "
1114,A Debilitating Sickness,Earthcaller Ryga at Mag'har Post in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring her 1 Drycap Mushroom from a cave inside the Great Fissure. ,"It is good that you've offered to aid us, <name>.  Our grunts have fallen sick from drinking contaminated water and I'm missing an ingredient to produce a healing salve.  I'm in need of a rare mushroom called drycap. Our foremost orders are to keep our location secret and not risk being spotted while looking for it, or I would go myself.  The only place in Hellfire Peninsula where drycap grows is a cave at the Great Fissure, south of here. Be extremely careful if you choose to seek it. "
1115,Know your Enemy,Speak with Lieutenant Amadi at the old guard tower just west of Honor Hold. ,"Rumors have surfaced that some new breed of orc is on the rise. Larger, meaner - more cunning than the brutes we're familiar with.  If these rumors are true then our forces, already stretched, may be taxed beyond their limit. I have entrusted my lieutenant, Amadi, with investigating this matter. If you would help us in this dark hour, seek her out. She is stationed at the broken tower just west of the Hold. And <name> - be careful out there. You're heading into a dangerous new world. "
1116,Zeth'Gor Must Burn! ,"Use the smoke beacon at each of Zeth'Gor's towers, and then return to Wing Commander Dabir'ee at Expedition Point. ","It's time to strike Zeth'Gor from the air!  Our gryphon riders are ready for a sortie, <name>.  But they need someone on the ground to direct their fire.  Are you ready for a covert mission? Take these smoke beacons into Zeth'Gor, the Bleeding Hollow stronghold to the west.  They have four guard towers: one near their northern wall, one near their southern wall, one near their forge and another nestled in their foothills.  Place a beacon underneath each of the towers and we'll fly in and bomb them! "
1117,Arrival in Outland,Commander Duron at the Dark Portal in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring Duron's Report to Amish Wildhammer. ,"I want you to speak with Amish Wildhammer, standing about 30 paces south of us, and catch the first flight to Honor Hold. When you arrive at Honor Hold, you'll be greeted by Marshal Isildor. I have prepared a report detailing our situation here.  Give him the report, and tell him you're ready for duty. You have your orders, soldier, now move out!  And though your blood must be burning to help us against the fiends below, waste no time here.  Honor Hold needs you even more. "
1118,The Agony and the Darkness,Magister Bloodhawk wants you to kill 10 Terrorfiends in the Pools of Aggonar. ,"Greetings, <name>. I've deciphered the Legion missive and uncovered the demons' strategic plans for this Peninsula. Apparently, there is a large group of hellish terrorfiends gathering near the Pools of Aggonar in the west. We cannot allow such a force to go unchallenged. You must go there and decimate their cursed numbers. "
1119,Through the Dark Portal,Travel through the Dark Portal and find Commander Duron. ,"For 20 years the Dark Portal has remained a silent monument - a eulogy to a time long since forgotten. <Relthorn looks around. >I never thought to see this day, yet here we stand, looking into the abyss. On the other side of this gate we are locked in a savage war - a war that we cannot win without support. You must go through the Dark Portal and help our troops, <class>. Report to Commander Duron at once. He awaits you in Outland. . . "
1120,"Waste Not, Want Not",Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to Dumphry at Honor Hold. ,"Reinforcements are great, but I don't see 'em haulin' any wagons loaded with ingots or timber. Take a look around, friend. Trees are in short supply, and the mines are overrun with Legion scum. I'm in a bad way fer supplies, and I'm makin' what substitutions I can, but it's time to start reusing what we can. The southern edge of the Path o' Glory is strewn with the ruins of siege machinery. Some pieces of 'em are still usable. Feeling up to a bit o' a salvage operation? "
1121,Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways,"Speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee, bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to Forward Commander Kingston at Expedition Point. ","Just west of the Dark Portal are two huge transporters: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz. If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road.  I want you to bomb them both into rubble! Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52.  Now, speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee -- he'll put you on a gryphon and send you on your way. "
1122,An Ambitious Plan,Use the Sanctified Crystal against a wounded Uncontrolled Voidwalker and return to Elsaana at the Temple of Telhamat. ,"The blood elves epitomize the irresponsible use of magic, <class>. They do not control magical energy. Rather, they are slaves to it and will suffer nothing to stand between them and their addiction. They consume the energies of Outland's voidwalkers to power their demonic magics. I've prepared a crystal charged with a spell that will allow us to neutralize a voidwalker and sever its link to this world when destroyed. I've mostly seen the voidwalkers in the Warp Fields to the southeast of Hellfire Citadel. "
1123,Mission: The Abyssal Shelf,"Forward Commander To'arch at Reaver's Fall in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons. ","Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission? This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north. I need you to get on a wyvern and destroy the whole damned thing! Here are your bombs - now, talk to Wing Commander Brack when you're ready for takeoff. "
1124,Fel Spirits,"Klatu in Honor Hold wants you to use the Anchorite Relic at Gor'gaz Outpost southwest of Honor Hold, slay Shattered Hand Berserkers near the relic, and then slay 10 released Fel Spirits to avenge Colonel Jules. ","Colonel Jules was cursed in a battle near the Gor'gaz Outpost, a haunt for Shattered Hand fel orcs.  My master, Barada, works feverishly to cure the poor human, but he needs help.  The Colonel's tormented spirit seeks peace, and his path to peace is, I fear, a path of vengeance. Take this anchorite relic to Gor'gaz Outpost.  Place it upon the ground near Shattered Hand orcs and defeat them.  This will release their fel spirits -- you must slay those fel spirits for Jules' own spirit's recovery. "
1125,The Cleansing Must Be Stopped,Place the Signaling Gem near the Altar of Aggonar at the Pools of Aggonar and defeat any Draenei Anchorites that respond to your summons. ,"Our scouts captured a draenei paladin at the Pools of Aggonar.  He was to take part in a cleansing ritual to purify the pools.  We must stop the draenei from succeeding or we will lose our supply of felblood! He was carrying this signaling gem, looking to mark a spot where a priest - or ""anchorite"" as they call themselves - could perform their rituals in safety.  Place the gem near the Altar of Aggonar and be ready to ambush any approaching draenei. I suggest that you take a friend or two along. "
1126,The Dark Missive,Take the Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv in the main keep of Honor Hold. ,"The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one at Honor Hold who can decipher such archaic script - the draenei mystic, Kryv. Take the Burning Legion Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv who resides within the War-Room at Honor Hold. "
1127,Dark Tidings,Dark Tidings is a dungeon quest with objectives in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"Giving the lifeless form of Vazruden the Herald the once-over, you discover a rolled letter, its seal yet unbroken.  An elaborate ""I"" is pressed within the blood-red ink.  Cracking the note open, the message that you read is most disturbing. Nazgrel back in Thrallmar will definitely want to take a look at this! "
1128,Dumphry's Request,"Bring 4 Fel Iron Bars, 2 Arcane Dust and 4 Motes of Fire to Dumphry at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula. ","Fel orcs might be complete barbarians but their smithing is not as primitive as you might think.  Only fel iron can be used with this mold if we want to end up with a working key - anything else would probably end up breaking it. Bring me some fel iron bars, a bit of arcane dust and motes of fire.  I'll try my hand at it, but I make no promises. "
1129,Laying Waste to the Unwanted,Use the Flaming Torch to burn the Horde Blade Throwers overlooking the Path of Glory. ,"Now that we've gotten our salvage operation off the ground, it's time to begin the second phase of the plan. Across the Path of Glory, the Horde still has their old blade throwers trained on us. Don't let their age fool you, <name>, they're still very dangerous. Much as we're working to reclaim what we can, we can't assume the Horde is going to dismantle their weaponry. Take this torch and burn the remaining siege equipment. I'll take no chances with Honor Hold's safety. "
1130,Forge Camp: Mageddon,Nazgrel in Thrallmar wants you to attack Forge Camp: Mageddon and kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and return with the head of Razorsaw. ,"<name>, we have reason to believe that the easternmost forge camp is not yet complete. The Legion's gan'arg servants are working 'round the clock to get the facility up and running. We can't allow that to happen. Head east to Forge Camp: Mageddon and slay 10 gan'arg. Bring me the head of their master - Razorsaw - and the Legion's fel reaver production will grind to a halt! "
1131,Marking the Path,"Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch wants you to go to the Great Fissure in Hellfire Peninsula and light the Southern Beacon, Western Beacon and Central Beacon. ","With the rock flayer population thinned, all that's left is to signal the safe path to our pilgrims.  Return to the Great Fissure with this torch and seek the three beacons that mark the path from the east. Light the three beacons and return to me.  Be warned that the beacons will attract any nearby rock flayers when you first light them. "
1132,The Path of Glory,"Cleanse 8 Trampled Skeletons on the Path of Glory with Draenei Holy Water, then return to Warp-Scryer Kryv at Honor Hold. ","The 'Path of Glory, ' they called it. A road leading from the heart of their gruesome fortress to the Dark Portal, paved with the bones of my people. It wasn't enough for them to hunt us down like animals, destroy our cities, and torture those who survived. No, they had to use our bones as paving stones, denying my brethren a proper burial under the Light. Those tortured souls still wander these lands, crying out for release. I ask you, <name>, help me in this undertaking. "
1133,Return to Thrallmar,Return to Thrallmar and speak with Nazgrel. ,"Hope you enjoyed your flight, friend. A messenger arrived while you were away - seems Nazgrel 's got a new use for you. You'd best head back to Thrallmar and check in with him. I have a feeling the Legion's just getting warmed up. "
1134,Bonechewer Blood,Bring 12 Bonechewer Blood Vials to Vurtok Axebreaker in Thrallmar. ,"Bonechewers!  They should all die!  The sight of their red skin and depravity makes my blood boil! I have a mission for you, <name>.  Kill Bonechewer orcs and collect their vile blood.  There is an apothecary who needs the blood for her tests, so we can discover how these orcs fell to the demon taint, a taint from which we so recently freed ourselves. Bonechewers scavenge near the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory, to the south.  Return to me when your mission is complete. "
1135,Ravager Egg Roundup,Retrieve 12 Ravager Eggs for Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"I'm starving! There's irony in that, wouldn't you say?  A starving cook? < Legassi laughs half-heartedly and taps a folded piece of parchment he has in his pocket. >According to this tourist map we were following - before we were so rudely shot down - there's an area to the southwest, near Terokkar Forest.  It's called the Razorthorn Trail, and supposedly it's brimming with delicious ravager eggs! I could cook up quite a feast if only someone were brave enough to go down there and get me some! "
1136,The Finest Down,Mirren Longbeard in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 8 Kaliri Feathers from the various kaliri found in the Den of Haal'esh. ,"The arakkoa at the Den of Haal'esh, south of here, breed a magnificent species of birds called kaliri.  Their feathers would fetch a bundle at the trading posts back in Azeroth.  Just think of all the ale I could buy then! Tell you what, you bring me a stack of kaliri feathers and I'll give you my very own hat.  What do you say?  You'll never find a hat like this one!  Do we have a deal? "
1137,Outland Sucks! ,Find 6 Shredder Parts and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar. ,"I can't believe I left Booty Bay to come to Outland.  My cousin Screed Luckheed promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his zeppelin and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine. How am I suppose to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time?  My shredder here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs.  They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there. "
1138,Void Ridge,Go to Void Ridge and kill the creatures you find. ,"We have to improve my warp rift generator.  You must take it to Void Ridge.  Head east of here.  You must avoid the foul fort of Zeth'Gor.  To the east beyond Zeth'Gor is a small pass through the mountains.  Through this pass you will find Void Ridge, a terrible place on the edge of the abyss. You must kill the walkers that you find there, and bring me shards of their souls.  With their power we will improve upon the warp rift generator and open a portal to the beyond that cannot be closed. "
1139,Falcon Watch,Report to Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"My people recently finished building Falcon Watch, a base of operations in the southwestern region of Hellfire Peninsula - beyond Hellfire Citadel.  You are welcome there as an ally, <name>. If you're looking for work, go there and tell Ranger Captain Venn'ren that I sent you.  He will see to it that you're given tasks worthy of someone of your caliber. "
1140,The Western Flank,"Kill 10 Shattered Hand Guards, 10 Shattered Hand Berserkers, and 5 Shattered Hand Acolytes, then report to Lieutenant Amadi at Honor Hold's western guard tower. ","In addition to other instructions, the orders tell the remaining fel orcs to prepare their equipment and rations for a coming attack. According to the plans, Warboss Nekrogg's forces are to form the western flank of a pincer attack on Honor Hold. With the hold's garrison concentrating on its eastern walls, an attack from the west would be devastating. Honor Hold can only hope to hold out if the western forces are kept out of the battle. "
1141,Blood for Blood,Magistrix Seyla at the Throne of Kil'jaeden wants you to kill 4 Emaciated Felbloods by using the Fel Siphon on them. ,"When Kael's forces retreated through that portal, his most loyal lackeys were rewarded with an abominable gift.  They  stayed behind and gorged themselves on the blood of demons for days. The blood has changed them, given them new powers.  It will also prove their undoing. Obtain blood samples from other demons.  Use them to power this fel siphon and deprive these arrogant fools of their new powers.  Slay them in their weakened state and return to me. "
1142,Demonic Contamination,"Thiah Redmane, at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula, has asked you to gather 6 Helboar Blood Samples from Hulking Helboars. ","Welcome to the Cenarion Post, <class>. We don't often get company out here, but I'm grateful for the visit. My work with the creatures of this desolate land requires me to travel to many remote places. The Cenarion Expedition has dispatched me to study some of the most dangerous wildlife in Outland, and I've made a startling discovery. While many creatures here have already undergone radical changes, they continue to mutate. I'm collecting blood samples to document the changes, and any help would be welcome. "
1143,The Mistress Revealed,Return to Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"I'm Arelion's friend, but I'm not going to take the beating of my life for him.  His mistress is Viera Sunwhisper. Go tell that harpy of a wife of his.  What's she going to do anyway? "
1144,Magic of the Arakkoa,Bring 4 Haal'eshi Scrolls to Arcanist Calesthris Dawnstar at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"Outland holds many secrets, <name>.  It's only a matter of time before we uncover them all. The half-bird, half-man species of the arakkoa possesses ancient arcane knowledge that would aid us greatly in our exploration of this world.  Travel to the Den of Haal'esh, south of here.  Obtain any magical scrolls that the Haal'eshi might be carrying on them and bring them to me. "
1145,Voidwalkers Gone Wild,"Bring 10 Condensed Voidwalker Essences to ""Screaming"" Screed Luckheed at the Zeppelin Crash. ","Even if I can get the zeppelin's frame repaired, I'll have to find something else to power the engine. I'm all out of fuel and there's no place to fill up around here! To the south of us is an area of broken land called the Warp Fields. It's full of rogue and uncontrolled voidwalkers, but I like to think of them as walking batteries. If you can bring me enough of their essence, I can convert the zeppelin's engine to run on it. Five gold says I'll even get better mileage out of it, too! "
1146,Vile Plans,Take the Burning Legion Missive to Magister Bloodhawk in Thrallmar. ,"The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one in Thrallmar that can transcribe such vile script - the blood elf Magister Bloodhawk. "
1147,Rohok's Request,"Bring 4 Fel Iron Bars, 2 Arcane Dust and 4 Motes of Fire to Rohok at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula. ","Fel orc blacksmiths may not be the most skilled in the world, but there is some craftsmanship to their trade.  Only fel iron can be used with this mold if we want to end up with a working key - anything else would probably end up breaking it. Bring me some fel iron bars, a bit of arcane dust and motes of fire.  I'll try my hand at it, but I make no promises. "
1148,A Peon's Work is Never Done,Gather 8 Clefthoof Hides and 8 sets of Clefthoof Bones from the Raging Clefthoof. ,"The Legion's constant assaults take a heavy toll on our defenses. If the palisade falls, so will Thrallmar. I've assigned peons to reinforce and repair the walls, but we're running out of materials. Grelag, one of the Far Seer's students, is well versed in the old ways and suggested returning to an ancient practice. Long ago, the clefthoof hunt supplied us with meat, hides, and bones. Taking up the hunt again, with the clefthoof to the southeast, would provide what's needed and honor the ancestors. "
1149,From the Abyss,Kill Void Baron Galaxis and collect his soul shard. ,"My warp rift generator is complete. You can now use it to summon a true prince of the void, a creature whose soul shard will tell us much of what lies beyond. Go south in Void Ridge and use my warp rift generator near the void stones.  Look for a cluster of crystals near the edge of the abyss.  A huge warp rift will form and Void Baron Galaxis will surely appear. Destroy this creature and bring me his soul shard. "
1150,Ill Omens,Lieutenant Amadi in Honor Hold wants you to bring 1 Cursed Talisman to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point. ,"<name>, in our battles with the Bleeding Hollow clan of fel orcs, we have found upon them foreboding trinkets.  These orcs have collected the insignias of fallen Honor Hold soldiers and created cursed talismans from them.  We fear the dark magic of the Bleeding Hollow orcs have transformed our insignias into evil charms with powers against us! Find such a talisman from the Bleeding Hollow orcs of Zeth'Gor, to the east, and bring it to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point, northeast of Zeth'Gor. "
1151,Testing the Antidote,Use the Cenarion Antidote on a Hulking Helboar and observe the results. ,"I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind! It's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do. Ridding the boars of their demonic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species. "
1152,The Pools of Aggonar,Amaan the Wise wants you to go to the Pools of Aggonar and slay 6 Terrorfiends and 6 Blistering Rots. ,Much has changed since the days when we called this land Draenor.  Parts of the land have been forever changed by the demons' taint. One such place is known as the Pools of Aggonar.  It was once the location of our people's sacred springs.  The blood of the demon Aggonar fouled the very essence of the holy waters.  This fel blood has spawned foul beings that must be cleansed if we're ever to reclaim the pools.  Travel east of here and slay the Terrorfiends and slimes that wander the pools. 
1153,Forward Base: Reaver's Fall,Forward Base: Reaver's Fall is a quest with objectives in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, <class>. They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Maimfist's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in. . . Head east about 200 paces and veer south at the jutting mass of land. You'll see Reaver's Fall where an old farm used to stand. Once there, you are to report to Foward Commander To'arch. Now move out! "
1154,Invasion Point: Annihilator,Slay Arix'Amal. ,"Well, we've located the Legion's final base on the ridge - Invasion Point: Annihilator. It lies northwest of Forge Camp: Rage - and it houses a warp-portal through which the Legion has been drawing its reinforcements! You've got to close that portal to prevent any more demons from coming through. The Point's overlord, Warbringer Arix'Amal, holds the portal's activation key. Take it from him and shut that blasted gateway down! "
1155,Hellfire Fortifications,"Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Battlecryer Blackeye in Thrallmar. ","The fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel must be scoured from our birthland!  To attack them, we must first secure forward staging points near the Citadel. Our outrunners found three fortifications that will suit this purpose, but the Alliance has the same idea and even now sends forces to take them! We want you to stop the Alliance and capture these forts.  Aid in the capture of each fort and then return to me. For the Horde! "
1156,The Arakkoa Threat,Gremni Longbeard in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to slay 4 Haal'eshi Windwalkers and 6 Haal'eshi Talonguards. ,"The arakkoa are smart creatures. . . smart as any gnome you ever met.  They have this way with magic and a violent temper, however. Lately they've taken to attacking Honor Hold patrols, which is why we were sent here.  See, Mirren and I are world-famous marksmen, we are!  But fowl and game are what we specialize in. . . not these. . . lightning-invoking birdmen. So what do you say you give us a hand in this one assignment?  You'll find the Den of Haal'esh to the southwest. "
1157,The Seer's Relic,"Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to return to Sedai's Corpse, northeast of the Temple of Telhamat, and use the Seer's Relic at that location. ","The stubborn close their mind and convince themselves of one truth.  The wise keep an open mind to the different possibilities leading to and stemming from the present. Take this relic with you to where you found Sedai.  See not with your eyes, <name>, but with your mind. "
1158,I Work. . . For the Horde! ,Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to Megzeg Nukklebust in Thrallmar. ,"Would you believe it?  These orcs hired me to help them shore up damaged fortifications and build explosives.  What a dream job!  It's too bad we're so short on materials, but a clever goblin like myself learns how to make do! Can you help me?  I need salvaged wood and metal from the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory.  Go down there and salvage, and watch out for those red-skinned orcs! When you're done, come back for big rewards! "
1159,The Battle Horn,Take the Unyielding Battle Horn from Lieutenant Commander Thalvos and bring it to Althen the Historian in Spinebreaker Post. ,Perhaps we have taken the wrong approach to the Unyielding? The tome tells me the Expedition Armory was destroyed by orcs and death knights long ago.  The Unyielding remain here as vengeful spirits trapped in an eternal battle against the fel orc clans. They think only of revenge.  We must arrange for them to defeat their most hated enemies.  Enter the Expedition Armory once again and find Lieutenant Commander Thalvos.  He carries a battle horn that can summon the Unyielding.  Bring it to me. 
1160,The Warp Rifts,Use the Unstable Warp Rift Generator in the Warp Fields. ,"Long have I wandered through Outland, searching for the truth of the void.  Now I am old and weak.  Perhaps you will help me? I must learn the secrets of the voidwalkers.  You must find the Warp Fields to the west.  West of the Expedition Armory there is a dark place on the edge of the abyss where time and space are weak.  Use my unstable warp rift generator in the Warp Fields to create a warp rift.  You must gather warp nether from the creatures that come through. "
1161,The Warchief's Mandate,Bring the Heavy Stone Axe to Far Seer Regulkut at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"As you know, the warchief put his power behind this expedition for one reason.  This is the world we came from.  This is where our roots lie. This journey means different things to orcs and blood elves.  To them it's a search for the promised land.  To us it's more like returning home. Whoever made this axe is familiar with the old ways and we must contact them.  This is too important for us to use ordinary tracking methods.  Show the weapon to Far Seer Regulkut; she will know what to do. "
1162,The Ring of Blood: The Final Challenge,"Defeat Mogor, Hero of the Warmaul. ","< Gurgthock is counting his massive pile of gold. >You've made me a lot of money, kid. If you can defeat Mogor, I promise to make it worth your while. All that pain you suffered in the Ring of Blood is gonna end up paying off. Now get in there and show these ogres what you're made of! "
1163,I'm Saved! ,Give the Bundle of Skins to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand. ,"I don't mind sharing.  I'm just glad to be saved from that creep, Gankly!  And I collected tons of skins from Zangarmarsh, so it's no problem at all! "
1164,Gava'xi,Slay Gava'xi near Oshu'gun and return to Zerid at Aeris Landing in Nagrand. ,"The presence of rogue ethereals in this area might amuse Gezhe, who sees nothing but opportunity wherever we go, but it's a true threat to the security of our operations. Their leader, Gava'xi, is a dangerous criminal and I've made it my top priority to see to it that he is neutralized. If you're looking to make yourself useful, go and take care of Gava'xi.  I will see to it that you're rewarded properly. "
1165,The Ultimate Bloodsport,Bring the Heart of Tusker to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Safari in Nagrand. ,"The queen of all that dwell in Nagrand is known as Tusker.  She's a giant elekk the likes of which you won't see anywhere else! You're right to be fearful of that name.  Bach'lor, Gutripper, and Banthar are nothing when compared to her.  It is said that she can be found on a huge bluff far to the southwest overlooking Oshu'gun.  Bring me her massive heart if you dare. Do you want to leave a letter with me so that I can have it delivered to your next of kin in the likely event that you don't return? "
1166,Vision of the Dead,"Nitrin at the Abandoned Armory in Nagrand wants you to bring him 1 Mountain Gronn Eyeball, 1 Flawless Greater Windroc Beak, and 1 Aged Clefthoof Blubber. ","It has already begun. Levixus stands atop the ruins of Auchindoun and reads from the book of the dead. He calls the dead out by name and, through demonic ritual, binds the tortured souls to his will. He will raise all of Auchindoun if given the chance! But. . . you must first prepare. You cannot do battle with that which you cannot see. <Nitrin hands you a parchment. >Bring me the items I require to brew the tincture. It will open your mind and allow you to see into the spirit world. "
1167,Gurok the Usurper,Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you destroy Gurok the Usurper and bring back Gurok's Earthen Head. ,"Gurok must be summoned. You summon Gurok and you destroy. You must go to Warmaul Hill to the northwest and find where ogre worships Gurok. You put ogre skull from Warmaul ogres on Gurok's earthen brand. Only then will Gurok come. Seven skulls. If you live, bring Gordawg back Gurok earthen head. Gordawg crushes head. < Gordawg bites down hard, shaking the earth beneath your feet. >"
1168,Cho'war the Pillager,Corki wants you to get Cho'war's Key so that you can free him from his cage. ,"They call him Cho'war the pillager, <name>. He's the ogre that forced out the gronn that used to rule over these ogres. You better believe he's powerful! The chef said that Cho'war lives in the big cave - wherever that may be. . . Get that key and get me out of here! If we live through this, my father will no doubt give you the big reward! As soon as I'm free, seek him out. "
1169,Wanted: Durn the Hungerer,Slay Durn the Hungerer. ,"You have destroyed two of the biggest threats in Nagrand, <name>. Are you ready to take on the scourge of the Spirit Fields? Durn the Hungerer lords over the area surrounding Oshu'gun, decimating all in his path. Thus far, none have been able to rid Nagrand of this ferocious gronn. Gather your allies and venture to the Spirit Fields, west of here, and track down Durn. Slay him and I assure you rewards commensurate with the difficulty of the task at hand. "
1170,The Ring of Blood: Brokentoe,Defeat Brokentoe. ,"So are you ready for your first battle? If you are, let me know and I'll get things started. All you have to do is go wait in the Ring of Blood for your opponent to arrive. This fight is against Brokentoe, a ferocious clefthoof. Good luck! I hope you brought friends. And remember, the fight's over when either you or your opponent are lying face down on the arena floor. "
1171,A Visit With the Greatmother,Speak to Greatmother Geyah and listen to what she has to tell you. ,"The Greatmother has asked that I seek you out and deliver a message. She wishes to speak with you at once. My will has been sapped but make no mistake, <name>, if you anger the Greatmother, I will come down upon you with all the force that I can muster. She is in the main hall. < Garrosh points at the large building to the north. >Listen to what she has to say and do as she tells you. "
1172,Cho'war the Pillager,Elder Yorley at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you slay Cho'war the Pillager and retrieve the Head of Cho'war. ,"Have you ever seen an ogre king, <race>? Few have and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are dealing with here. The leader of these barbarians is an ogre named Cho'war. Rumor has it that Cho'war was the ogre responsible for forcing the gronn out of the cave. Cho'war then declared himself king and dissolved the ogre clans that served under the gronn. Thus, Warmaul was born. Find Cho'war deep in the caves of Warmaul Hill. Slay him and bring me his head. "
1173,Forge Camp: Annihilated,Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand has asked that you Destroy Forge Camp: Hate and Destroy Forge Camp: Fear. ,"Gather your allies, <name>.

Take their keys and use them to turn and fire the fel cannons upon the camps. Return to me once the camps are destroyed. "
1174,Altruis,Travel to western Nagrand and find Altruis the Sufferer. ,It is rare in this day and age to hear of those who follow the path of the demon hunter.  It is rarer still to find someone who does and has no allegiance to Illidan. There are rumors of one such individual here in Outland.  One name is said to be feared in the Legion fields of Nagrand more than any army of Aldor vindicators.  That name is Altruis. Go to western Nagrand and find him.  He might be willing to shed some light on these new demon hunter training grounds. 
1175,Murkblood Invaders,Take the Murkblood Invasion Plans to Garrosh. ,The parchment holds a crudely painted map of Nagrand. There is a big red 'X' where Garadar would be on the map. It would seem that these savages are planning an attack on the city. Take the Murkblood invasion plans to Garrosh in Garadar. 
1176,Patience and Understanding,Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand wants you to take the Master Planner's Blueprints to Sal'salabim in Shattrath City and convince him to help you. ,"Take the blueprints and travel to Shattrath City in the Terokkar forest. Once at Shattrath, go to the Lower City and look for a mo'arg by the name Sal'salabim. He'll probably be at the bar, drinking away his sorrows. By the way, you may need to convince him to lend his assistance. Try to approach him with patience and understanding. If that does not work, use your fists. "
1177,Talbuk Mastery,Obtain the Hoof of Bach'lor and return it to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand. ,"<Wracking cough. >Don't worry about. . . <cough>. . . me.  I'll be fine.

An ancient orc that passed through the Dark Portal in the time of our fathers and has since returned to his homeland. I wish for you to track down this orc and try to convince him to pull back the Boulderfist ogres. He resides on an upper platform in the Burning Blade Ruins to the southeast near the border of Terokkar. Good luck, <name>! Be warned, he is a blademaster. . . "

1180,The Master's Grand Design? ,Find Nitrin the Learned at the Abandoned Armory in Nagrand. ,"A couple of draenei paid us a visit last night. They'd somehow learned that we had the book in our possession and made a very generous offer to ""take it off our hands. ""We didn't ask them what they wanted with the book but the young one kept talking about ""the master's grand design, "" whatever that means. Look, I don't ask questions when money is in play. They gave us a lot of gold and we gave them the book. He said that they lived in Nagrand - in the old Abandoned Armory, north of Telaar. "
1181,What the Soul Sees,Locate a Soul Mirror somewhere in the Auchenai Crypts and use it to call forth a Darkened Spirit from Ancient Orc Ancestors in Nagrand. ,"For several centuries, the spirits of Auchindoun coalesced into my darkened essence. Many of the catastrophes that befell this crypt were a direct result of my weakened state. Regrettably, there is nothing that can be done to stop this cycle. It is a facet of the naaru condition - without the void, the Light cannot exist. Your only recourse is to destroy the ancient spirits of Nagrand before they transform into creatures of the void. Use the soul mirrors found throughout this crypt to free them. . . "
1182,Wanted: Durn the Hungerer,Slay Durn the Hungerer. ,"You have destroyed two of the biggest threats in Nagrand, <name>. Are you ready to take on the scourge of the Spirit Fields?

"
1183,An Audacious Advance,Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you slay 10 Boulderfist Warriors and 10 Boulderfist Mages. ,Directly west of here you will find the Halaani Basin.

I need you to track down those troops and kill all that you encounter in the name of Mag'har. 
1184,He Called Himself Altruis. . . ,"If you are looking to fight the Burning Legion, find Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand. ","A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week. He introduced himself as Altruis and then proceeded to ask us several questions about Nagrand. He claimed that he was hunting Legion. That such insanity was actually his job. Can you imagine? A person that would willingly hunt demons? Before he left, he asked that we let the would-be heroes in town know that he will be staying in western Nagrand for awhile and that should they seek a purpose, to find him. "
1185,Hero of the Mag'har,Return to Greatmother Geyah at Garadar in Nagrand. ,I must set things in order before I leave. Return to the Greatmother and tell her that her grandson comes.

They call themselves the ""Blue Brothers. ""It's not too late to chicken out, <name>. I'd certainly understand.

1187,Stealing from Thieves,Obtain 10 Oshu'gun Crystal Fragments and bring them to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand. ,"Nexus Prince Haramad has ordered us to not begin work inside of Oshu'gun as it might anger a certain powerful naaru.  Sort of puts a damper on our operation. I think I might've found a loophole, however. You see, we're not the only ethereals drawn to this colossal diamond.  A thief called Gava'xi has led a band of rogue ethereals into Oshu'gun and they've begun to dislodge large fragments from it. Your job, <race>, is to go there and retrieve what is rightfully ours. "

1193,The Totem of Kar'dash,Escort the Mag'har Captive out of Sunspring Post. ,"Thank you, stranger. They would have surely killed me had it not been for you. I was kidnapped by these Murkbloods 3 nights ago during a nighttime raid on Garadar. What I have since uncovered may very well shake the foundation of the Outland: these savages seek to recover the totem of Kar'dash! We cannot allow the totem to fall into the hands of the Murkbloods! You must help me escape. And stranger, if I do not make it back to Garadar, you must tell Garrosh what happened here. . . "
1194,The Ring of Blood: The Warmaul Champion,Defeat the Warmaul Champion. ,"They had to ship the champion in from the Blade's Edge gladiator pits. He was training on mountain giants - three at a time. If you win this one, you become the new champion. What do you think your odds are, kid? Do you have a shot?

Let them see the fury of the elements! "
1196,A Head Full of Ivory,Collect 3 Pair of Ivory Tusks and return them to Shadrek at Aeris Landing in Nagrand. ,"Ivory is a much sought after prize.  I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it. I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits. The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after.  Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire. Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei. Do you and I have an understanding? "
1197,Survey the Land,Sit back and enjoy the ride. ,"To be my eyes will require some diligence on your part. Nethrandamus will take you through the Legion camps, but you must catalog everything that you see. Even the smallest detail that you may think to be inconsequential could be useful for our purposes.

1199,The Totem of Kar'dash,Escort the Kurenai Captive out of Sunspring Post. ,"I would have been killed had you not come along, stranger. They have already murdered so many Kurenai in their search for a lost relic. What they seek is the totem of Kar'dash. Why they think that we would know anything about this totem, I cannot understand. Is a totem not an orcish implement by nature? This information must be taken back to Arechron. Perhaps he knows why Murkblood are kidnapping Kurenai and torturing them for information regarding an orcish device. Let's go before more come. "
1200,HELP! ,Find the Boulderfist Key and Free Corki. ,"HELP! They're gonna eat me! I just know it! Find the key, I know it has to be on one of these ogres. If you get me out of here, my father will reward you handsomely! He's the leader of Telaar, Arechron. "

The master planner dictates what types of structures are present at a forge camp and how each structure is situated. Moreover, this information is kept on a set of blueprints that the planner carries around on their person. We need the master planner's blueprints.

He will be stationed behind the forges. "

It's from a clan of ogres known as Warmaul that rule the northwestern lands of Nagrand. It says that they have Corki and if we don't cooperate, they're going to eat him. Admittedly, Corki is a moron, but he's still my blood. Will you rescue him, <name>? I presume that he's locked up in a cage somewhere on Warmaul Hill. That should be your first stop. "
1205,Body of Evidence,Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to use the Damp Woolen Blanket at the Blazing Warmaul Pyre in the Laughing Skull Courtyard to signal his ogres. ,"Your rampage through Kil'sorrow Fortress has provided us with a special opportunity. We have enough bodies to make it appear as if a great battle has taken place. Travel to the Laughing Skull Ruins and find the Laughing Skull Courtyard. There should be a blazing pyre in the courtyard. Make sure the area is secure and then use this blanket to send up smoke signals. When my ogres see the smoke, they will sneak in and plant the bodies of slain Kil'sorrow soldiers. That should be the final straw! "
1206,Visions of Destruction,Speak with Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold. ,"A vision of cataclysm often disturbs my rest -- a rain of green fire falling to the earth, felling the valiant defenders of a mighty fortress.

His name is either Dump or Lump. <Bintook turns the parchment sideways and cocks her head. >It could also be Billy.

1210,Against the Illidari,Altruis the Sufferer wants you to slay Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"I still have respect for Illidan.  Without him I would not have found my path. He is not who he once was, however.  His soul has been corrupted by power, his mind has been twisted by defeat.  He has become what I am sworn to destroy and his pet servants, the Illidari, are as much of an abomination as any demon of the Burning Legion. His grasp on Outland is slipping yet his reach is still vast.  Prove you're not with him by slaying his lieutenant Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley. "
1211,Message to Telaar,Take the Burning Blade Peace Offering to Arechron at Telaar in Nagrand. ,<Lantresor points to an unmarked crate. >Take it. It is my offering to your people.

","As long as the transporters stand, nothing we do to the forge camps will have any permanence. We must find a way to destroy the Legion structures. I need time to devise a plan of attack. If you can keep their engineers and tinkerers busy, it would greatly slow down their progress, buying me the time I need. Stay as far away as possible from the overseers, <name>. They are extremely dangerous beings. "

1215,Obsidian Warbeads,Bring 10 Obsidian Warbeads to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand. ,"All this waiting around for Oshu'gun to be ready for digging is eating into our profits, <name>. Fortunately, I've devised an alternate source of income.  The ogres of Nagrand wear warbeads made of obsidian, a mineral that commands a hefty price in many other worlds. Zerid already has had to take care a few of the brutes as a matter of security.  Think of the warbeads as an added bonus.  Or better yet, don't think about it too much and just bring them to me. "
1216,Corki's Gone Missing Again! ,Arechron at Telaar has asked that you find and free Corki. ,"< Arechron sighs. >This is so embarrassing. Do you remember my boy, Corki? You rescued him from the Burning Blade Ruins recently. Well, his curiosity has gotten the best of him once more.

1218,He Called Himself Altruis. . . ,"If you are looking to fight the Burning Legion, find Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand. ","A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week. He introduced himself as Altruis and then proceeded to ask us several questions about Nagrand. He claimed that he was hunting Legion. That such insanity was actually his job. Can you imagine? A person that would willingly hunt demons? Before he left, he asked that we let the would-be heroes in town know that he will be staying in western Nagrand for awhile and that should they seek a purpose, to find him. "
1219,I Must Have Them! ,Wazat across from Clan Watch in southern Nagrand wants you to bring him 3 Air Elemental Gases. ,"Do you see them? ? By Gazlowe's horrific halitosis, I will have those eggs!

For decades we have dealt with the ogres of Nagrand but now a new threat has arisen. The Broken tribe of Murkblood attacked our fishing village to the southwest, Sunspring Post, and managed to kill or evict all of the orcs that inhabited the town. While the others feel that the best course of action is to kill indiscriminately, I know that we must destroy their leadership. I do not know who their leader is but I suspect that you will know when you find him. "
1221,Because Kilrath is a Coward,Take the information that you beat out of Unkor to Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand. ,Take what you have learned and tell Jorin at Garadar.

1225,Against All Odds,Altruis the Sufferer wants you to take the Imbued Silver Spear and use it at Portal Clearing near Marshlight Lake in Zangarmarsh to awake Xeleth. ,"Some demons pledge allegiance to no one but themselves.  A true enemy of demons finds and destroys his prey regardless of affiliation, however. The demon Xeleth - a Legion defector - was once worshipped as a god by primitive swamp creatures in Zangarmarsh.

They came from all sides, killing several of the procession guards and many of the others. They even desecrated the remains of the elder in the wagon. And for what? So they could humiliate us and display their power. Not even Boulderfist would have sunk so low. I am a spiritual orc, <name>, but even I have limitations. Find the attackers at Warmaul Hill to the northwest and destroy them! "
1233,Missing Mag'hari Procession,Search for the missing Mag'hari procession. ,"Greatmother says that we must press on and serve our people.

According to him, these, uh, multiphase. . . um, spectro-goggles will allow the wearer to see the distortions and take readings from them.

Kill them to find the plans! "
1258,A Strange Vision,Speak with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52. ,"I've had a most unusual vision, <name>, and I don't know quite what to make of it.

As a representative of the Scryers, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can. "
1263,Warp-Raider Nesaad,Kill Warp-Raider Nesaad and then return to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"Warp-Raider Nesaad must be dealt with!  I have no idea how he survived my attack, but he cannot be allowed to continue his operation out there. Go back and take out Nesaad.  He keeps a small ethereal camp near the southwestern corner of the Heap. Don't fail like I did, <class>. "
1264,Deathblow to the Legion,Deathblow to the Legion is a group quest with objectives in Netherstorm. ,"When facing eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part.  Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them. Take this stone to the Invasion Point: Overlord, between Forge Base: Oblivion and Gehenna and bring your closest, strongest friends with you.  Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them. May the Light prevail today, <name>.  May Socrethar meet his end. "
1265,Dr. Boom! ,Kill Dr. ,"<name>, my former protege, Sparky Uberthruster, wouldn't wear his helmet while down here and one day transformed into the infamous Dr. Boom! And he stole off to the northeast with most of our sapping equipment!  He and his Boom Bots have been a menace to Area 52 ever since. I need you to go to his Camp of Boom just outside of town and put an end to him!  Use these Boom's Doom bombs to take him out. And make sure not to get too close to him or his Boom Bots! "
1266,Off To Area 52,Deliver the Netherologist's Notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"I'm out here studying the nether - the ethereal currents and all that.  This is an ideal spot away from the lights and hubbub of town.  Isn't this bridge great?  If I could just keep this junk working. Hey, you know, if you're looking for work there's plenty at Area 52!  It's just up the path and take a right at the fork in the road. Why don't you deliver my latest research notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage?  I'm sure that he'd have plenty for you to do, what with the X-52 rocket ship, and all! "
1267,Another Heap of Ethereals,The Consortium is keenly interested in wiping out all of the Zaxxis rebels at the Heap to the south. ,"Traitors, all of them! Good work, <class>!  If you find your way back down there again, I'm always looking to add to my collection of their insignia! "
1268,The Horrors of Pollution,Take the Vial of Void Horror Ooze to Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm. ,You carefully fill a vial with the fallen void horror's ooze. Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post would be quite interested in such a find! Take it to him at once! 
1269,A Heap of Ethereals,Collect 10 Zaxxis Insignias and return them to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"There is something else that I want your help with. A group of ethereals, known as the Zaxxis, have cut their relationship with the Consortium and gone into business for themselves.  They've even cut deals with the Sunfury blood elves.  This will not be tolerated! I infiltrated their group at the Heap to the south.  But after I took out their leader, I had to escape here to Area 52. <class>, go down there and bring back their insignias.  Of course, not all wear them because they're cowards. "
1270,Shutting Down Manaforge Ara,Travel to Manaforge Ara and obtain the Ara Access Crystal from Overseer Azarad. ,"One manaforge is all that keeps Tempest Keep functional.  After we bring Manaforge Ara down, Kael will have to resort to depleting whatever energy he's got stored up. Travel to Manaforge Ara, in the northwest, and deliver the final blow that we need by shutting it down. The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad.  Be warned that we expect heavy opposition in the last of Kael's functional manaforges.  You're likely to need the assistance of reliable friends. "
1271,"It's a Fel Reaver, But with Heart",Recover the Heart of the Fel Reaver and deliver it to N. ,"You see that scrapped fel reaver over there to the south?  Isn't it a thing of beauty? I want its heart! What?  Yes, of course it has a heart. . . what doesn't? <N. D. looks indignant for a moment. >Go on over there, pry it open, bring back what I want and I'll give you a nice finder's fee in return. Oh, and I'd take a friend or two along if I were you.  These Zaxxis ethereals are a pretty mean bunch! Take this fel zapper to jumpstart its heart when you're ready to begin. "
1272,Wanted: Annihilator Servo! ,Obtain an Annihilator Servo and deliver it to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,WANTED:  1 Annihilator Servo to replace the failing one in my Long Neck Spectrum Analyzer. You and your friends might want to check with the blood elves at Manaforge B'naar to the west to see if they have any spares.  They seem to have a few arcane annihilators roaming about. Please deliver the servo in pristine condition to Papa Wheeler at Area 52. 
1273,Turning Point,Turning Point is a group quest with objectives in Netherstorm. ,"This is the chance we've been waiting for, <name>.  Not only have we uncovered the evidence we need to show our people who Kael'thas is really working for, but we can prove our strength by defeating his new masters. My frail health prevents me from aiding you in person with this endeavor, but I will offer you an object that will allow me to project my powers across the continent. "
1274,Sunfury Attack Plans,Lord Torvos in Shattrath wants you to capture the Sunfury Attack Plans. ,"As we press the offensive on Quel'Danas, we've discovered that Kael'thas' minions are planning a counterattack. By ordering the Sunfury blood elves, based in Netherstorm, to attack our operations in Outland, he hopes to draw troops and attention away from the Sunwell. We must not allow this to happen, <name>. Each and every blade is needed on the front lines. Go to Netherstorm and capture their attack plans. Any of the Sunfury blood elves up there could be in possession of the plans. Good luck, <name>. "
1275,Ethereum Secrets,Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to bring him an Ethereum Prisoner I. ,"<Ameer holds up a tag. >I found this prisoner I. D. tag with the remains of the fallen vanguard. I can only assume that all of their prisoners are tagged in the same manner. I'm going to start cataloguing the tags in hopes of making sense of their penal system. If in your adventures you find more Ethereum prison keys, you can use them to open the Ethereum prisons at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - directly south of here. Bring me back any and all I. D. tags that you find. "
1276,Triangulation Point One,Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the first triangulation point. ,"There is another reason for the retrieval of the surveying equipment.  There is a crystal from draenei legend of great importance to me. It is said that the crystal bestows god-like powers to its bearer!  But it is in danger of being unearthed by others - namely the Burning Legion. <name>, take the equipment and use it to find the first triangulation point.  We know it to be somewhere to the east near Manaforge Ultris. Afterward, check-in with my agent, Dealer Hazzin, on the Manaforge Ultris island. "
1277,Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar,Return to Manaforge B'naar and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis. ,"We cannot shut down the manaforges by force as we'd risk causing an explosion that would shake Outland to the core. According to your transcription, there is an emergency shutdown that permanently disables the technology - a safety mechanism common in naaru constructs. To perform this procedure you will have to obtain a crystal that will allow you to communicate with the console.  This access crystal is in the possession of an overseer called Theredis according to our information. "
1278,Breaking Down Netherock,Slay Netherock and then report in with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"To whomever cares about the timely construction of the X-52 Nether-Rocket --The king of the local mountain giants, Netherock, has been terrorizing the Crumbling Wastes.  He's been interfering with operations all along the south ledge of the island! Take your friends and deal with him!  Then, return to me here in Area 52. Rocket-Chief Fuselage"
1279,Assisting the Consortium,Speak with Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"The naaru of Shattrath City have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things. Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the Netherstorm has recently soured. There's a Consortium representative in town named Nether-Stalker Khay'ji who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals.  As a representative of the Aldor, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can. "
1280,Naaru Technology,Go inside Manaforge B'naar and find the B'naar Control Console. ,"The Scryers obtained a personnel roster for Manaforge B'naar and are now having a field day picking out assassination targets. They've missed one small bit of information, scribbled on the side of the roster.  It appeared to be a password or code like those used to access naaru-made technology like the Exodar or Tempest Keep. Go inside the manaforge and look for a control panel.  Copy its readouts on this scroll as well as you can.  We must confirm our suspicions about the origin of the technology. "
1281,Consortium Crystal Collection,Obtain an Arklon Crystal Artifact and return it to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"Our leader, Nexus-Prince Haramad, has tasked me with the acquisition of a crystal artifact from the Arklon Ruins to the southeast. They're old draenei ruins.  Unfortunately for both myself and the goblins here, the Burning Legion has decided to move in to perform their own excavation. If you're willing to help me, go to the ruins and take the crystal artifact from the dreadlord named Pentatharon. "
1282,Help Mama Wheeler,Speak with Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm. ,"Say, <name>, I was wondering if you could do me another favor. My partner out in the field could probably use a hand.  I was wondering if you could go check in on her. I'm sure that Mama Wheeler will appreciate the help.  Just don't mind her sharp tongue. She's trying to look out for our interests to the east.  You'll find her just inside Eco-Dome Midrealm at the Midrealm Post. "
1283,Getting Down to Business,"Gather 8 Nether Dragon Essence, then return to the Ethereal Teleport Pad area. ","As you've no doubt seen, the area is teeming with nether dragons in various stages of growth. All nether dragons, young and old, contain an essence that's highly desired by K -- err, by a client of mine. Most people aren't willing to risk their lives to gather it, so we've got the place to ourselves. You can start by gathering the essence from any of the creatures out here, but it's imperative that we start building a supply right away. Return to me once you have the first batch. "
1284,A Mission of Mercy,Recover the Salvaged Ethereum Prison Key for Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm. ,We salvaged this prison orb on our last scouting mission into Ethereum territory. We'd have never found it had it not been for the distress signal that it was faintly emitting. We think one of our own might be locked up in there but we have no way of opening the orb up without harming whatever is inside. What we know about the Ethereum is that any of their members could - at any given time - be carrying a key to unlock an orb. Retrieve one and return so that we may uncover the mysteries of this orb. 
1285,You're Hired! ,Collect 10 Etherlithium Matrix Crystals and return them to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"Let me be the first to welcome you aboard, Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>! We're building my masterpiece out here - the X-52 Nether-Rocket! But first we need to get all of the parts and fuel for it.  That's where you come in. To start, I need crystals - LOTS of crystals - for the rocket's Etherlithium Engine Matrix.  The draenei had crystals coming out of their ears! So head north to the Ruins of Enkaat and get them for me!  Nevermind all of the draenei ghosts. "
1286,Measuring Warp Energies,Exarch Orelis in Area 52 wants you to take the Warp-Attuned Orb to Manaforge B'naar and use it at the end of its four pipelines. ,"If our instincts are right and these manaforges have been made using technology from Tempest Keep, then all of Outland could be in grave danger. Tempest Keep's energy-recharging mechanisms were never supposed to be used this close to the land.  The warp energies are capable of destroying this very land, even when contained within Kael's pipelines. Take this orb to Manaforge B'naar; it is attuned to measure warp energies.  Use it at the pipelines' ends, where they go into the earth. "
1287,Run a Diagnostic! ,Retrieve the Diagnostic Results and return them to Mehrdad at Midrealm Post. ,"Wherever the Consortium establishes a presence, we bring our eco-dome technology. The fields allow us to work in a controlled and life-sustaining atmosphere since we often find ourselves in hostile environments. Netherstorm 's volatile conditions and creatures have begun to destroy the equipment that sustains our domes, especially the generator east of here. I've started a diagnostic there in hopes of understanding what can be done to combat the damage. Would you collect the results and bring them to me? "
1288,Nexus-King Salhadaar,The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to use the Protectorate Disruptor to bring down Salhadaar's force fields and then destroy Nexus-King Salhadaar. ,"I have in my possession another disruptor, one capable of destroying the three conduits that surround Salhadaar. Once the conduits are destroyed, Salhadaar's protective force fields will be down. For this act, he will strike at you with a ferocity you have never before witnessed, <name>. If you are willing to rid the world of Salhadaar, I will give you the disruptor. "
1289,A Not-So-Modest Proposal,Retrieve the Teleporter Power Pack and bring it to the Ethereal Teleport Pad on the Celestial Ridge to the east of Manaforge Ultris. ,"From the look on your face, I can tell you're a <race> who appreciates a good profit. I've built a reputation as a dealer in exotic goods, and I'm about to launch a new venture. I need a reliable subcontractor to procure the goods from the Celestial Ridge. First, you'll need to re-energize a teleport pad. There is a spare power pack in Access Shaft Zeon, which is on the south side of Manaforge UItris. The Protectorate is operating in there, so you may be able to follow their tracers to your goal. "
1290,Seek Out Ameer,Seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post. ,"It would seem that an outside force has taken an interest in the business practices of the Consortium. Five Consortium dealers have gone missing in the past two days. We have reason to believe the Ethereum are involved. If you are interested in assisting, seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post. You will find the Protectorate Watch Post directly east of here on the next island. "
1291,Krasus's Compendium,"Reclaim Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 1, Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 2, and Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 3 from Kirin'Var Village's Town Square. ","The Kirin Tor sent one other of Krasus's possessions with our expedition. It was his spellbook, called Krasus's Compendium. Containing all the spells he mastered, it lent us a much-needed advantage in the war. Before Kael'thas and his forces laid siege to Kirin'Var, the compendium had been stolen from me by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying necromancy. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of town. "
1292,Invaluable Asset Zapping,"Use the Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to beam the Hyper Rotational Dig-A-Matic, Servo-Pneumatic Dredging Claw, Multi-Spectrum Terrain Analyzer, and the Big Wagon Full of Explosives back to Area 52. ","See the fissure running through Area 52?  We did that!  <grin>It's yielding up all sorts of goodies for the X-52 Nether-Rocket, but we're running short on equipment. We had an operation at the Arklon Ruins to the southeast until the Burning Legion moved in.  I need you to take this Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to the ruins.  Use it to beam our gear back to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle down in the fissure. Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>, this is your chance for that promotion.  Don't blow it! "
1293,Unlocking the Compendium,Obtain the Heliotrope Oculus from Spellreaver Marathelle at Sunfury Hold. ,"While I'm glad to have most of Krasus's Compendium back, it's useless without the heliotrope oculus. You see, Krasus was well aware of the sheer power of the spells recorded in the book and took steps to safeguard them from prying eyes. Only a knowledgeable mage can use the oculus to unlock the compendium's secrets. During Kael'thas's attack, one of his lieutenants, Spellreaver Marathelle, looted it and took it to Sunfury Hold northeast of the tower. No doubt she thought it a pretty little bauble. "
1294,Aldor No More,Report back to Exarch Orelis at Area 52. ,"My mission here is finished.  I did what Orelis ordered me to - I've never failed to. No more.  I foresee a great carnage - a crusade, they'll call it - following the news of this alliance between Kael'thas and the Burning Legion. First they give our holiest city away to our enemies and then they ask us to die fighting their enemies.  Go back to Orelis; tell him the naaru can fight their own fights from now on. "
1295,The Archmage's Staff,Retrieve Archmage Vargoth's Staff from Ekkorash the Inquisitor and bring it to Ravandwyr in Area 52. ,"Allow me to introduce myself, <class>. I am Ravandwyr, apprentice to the Archmage Vargoth. My master is. . . indisposed, shall we say. I am here on a matter of great importance. The Arklon Ruins southeast of the city are a hotbed of Burning Legion activity. Their purpose in the ruins concerns neither me nor my master, but their leader, Ekkorash, possesses the archmage's staff. This conjuring powder will allow you to draw the demon out of hiding. Sprinkle it on the brazier at the center of the ruins. "
1296,Drijya Needs Your Help,Speak with Drijya near Invasion Point: Destroyer in the Netherstorm. ,"<class>, it is good to see a helpful face around here. The Burning Legion at the nearby fel reaver heap has become more bold, and I am beginning to fear for our safety here.  The demons are constantly receiving reinforcements from Invasion Point: Destroyer to the south. My compatriot, Drijya, has gone down there to scout and see if he can do something about the Burning Legion's warp-gate. Please find and assist him in any way that you can. "
1297,Dimensius the All-Devouring,Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to speak with Captain Saeed and then follow his army to Manaforge Ultris and kill Dimensius the All-Devouring! . ,"Your brave actions have forced Ameer to react! He has deployed Captain Saeed and the Avengers! Now all that is left to do is destroy Dimensius. When you are ready, I will call for Saeed. If he is not currently fighting another battle, he will be awaiting orders from you - directly east of here. Let him know when you are ready to fight and he will put his troops in motion! I wish you luck, fleshling! We have hunted Dimensius for a thousand years! "
1298,One Demon's Trash. . . ,Gather 10 Fel Reaver Parts and return them to Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm. ,"You look like a capable young <man/woman>!  I was wondering if you could lend me a hand? To the east is the Scrap Field, which the Burning Legion has moved into.  It's full of huge fel reaver parts.  There're also a whole bunch of smaller parts in there that they don't seem to care about. I want you to get in there and get me a lot of those smaller fel reaver parts! "
1299,Kick Them While They're Down,"Slay 8 Sunfury Conjurers, 6 Sunfury Bowmen and 4 Sunfury Centurions. ","The news you've discovered is fortunate, <name>.  Not only do you get to waltz into Manaforge Duro unfettered, this also presents a great opportunity to deal a blow to Kael's army. Use the mana creature assault to your advantage and pick off any Sunfury stragglers you run into. I do not take particular glee in the senseless slaughter of my own kin the way that Thalodien does, but the tactical advantage here is too high to pass up. "
1300,Finding the Keymaster,Locate Apex and obtain Apex's Crystal Focus from him. ,"In retrospect, I suppose I should've expected Kael'thas's magic to be this robust. He's always been a talented mage, but I've never seen anything like the power he wielded during the attack on the tower. The ward keeps me from being able to scry out the force holding it in place, but it doesn't preclude you from scrying. You'll require a focus, though. A crystal-bearing giant named Apex roams the plains to the west of Manaforge Duro. One of its crystals would make an excellent scrying focus. "
1301,Cohlien Frostweaver,Locate Cohlien Frostweaver's quarters in Wizard Row and return the hat to his Footlocker. ,"Looking at the hat, you find yourself asking if any Kirin Tor mage would own such headgear. Judging from the hat's wear, it seems the gnome wouldn't go anywhere without it. You try on the hat momentarily, discovering no magical properties beyond a faint urge to dance. The treasured possession might be the source of the dead mage's bond to the village. Placing the hat in the footlocker in Cohlien's quarters might free his spirit. "
1302,Surveying the Ruins,Place the three Surveying Markers and then return to Zephyrion at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm. ,I have to get over to the Ruins of Farahlon to start my excavations!  The problem is that the place has been infested by demons! Maybe you could do some preliminary work for me? There are three locations within the ruins to the northeast where I want you to place surveying markers.  Each is near a draenei banner. Return to me when you've managed to place all three markers. 
1303,Outside Assistance,"Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of Area 52, and speak to Kaylaan. ","The Sunfury briefings support the theory that Kael'thas has been receiving outside help in constructing and running these manaforges.  Who this is remains a bit of a mystery, though we're likely to find out in Manaforge Ara. I've sent a group of my men to scout the surrounding area.  Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of here, and speak to Kaylaan.  See what he's discovered at Manaforge Ara.  Find out who is assisting the Sunfury army and take care of them. "
1304,"You, Robot",Activate the Scrap Reaver X6000 Controller and test out its capabilities. ,"Doctor Vomisa, Ph. T. at your service.  Here, take this controller.  I want you to activate it and give my newly-invented Scrap Reaver X6000 a spin. Just stay nearby!  The controller is tied to my console here, and if you get too far away, the robot will cease to function. Try out everything. . . I'll be watching and calibrating its servos based upon your test run. "
1305,Diagnosis: Critical,Use the Diagnostic Device while standing near the Eco-Dome Sutheron Generator and bring the Diagnostic Results back to Ghabar at the Stormspire. ,"If Mehrdad's results are correct -- and I have no reason to believe they're faulty -- then the rest of the domes could be in trouble. I do think Mehrdad has failed to identify the underlying cause of the failures. From time to time, creatures damage the generators, but never this severely. To be on the safe side, I'd like for you to run a set of diagnostics at the Stormspire's main dome generator, located in Eco-Dome Sutheron at the very eastern edge of the dome. "
1306,Success! ,Return to Ghabar at the Stormspire in Netherstorm. ,"The test was a resounding success! We can certainly use this device to start repairing the domes. Carry word of the test results to the Stormspire and let Ghabar know that I've also found a pattern in the damage to the shield generators. Key pieces of generator units have gone missing from a number of sites. This is no accident, <name>, no technological failure. We're being stolen from. "
1307,Elemental Power Extraction,Extract 5 Elemental Power for Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"Darn it, that didn't do it! Ok, I've got another idea!  I had Xyrol whip up an elemental power extractor.  I'm not certain exactly what this power will do, but I know that I can use it. The sundered rumblers and warp aberrations on the ledge of the Crumbling Wastes to the south have just what I need for the engines! The extractor will change the form of their power into something solid that you'll be able to gather up after you've defeated them. "
1308,The Ethereum,"Commander Ameer wants you to kill 5 Ethereum Assassins, 5 Ethereum Shocktroopers, 2 Ethereum Researchers and Captain Zovax then activate Ethereum Transponder Zeta. ","Directly south of here you will find the Ethereum Staging Grounds. The Ethereum are there, preparing for something. . . Perhaps an assault on Ultris. We can't take any chances, though, <class>. Break through their perimeter defenses and take out their training facility. Once you've destroyed their soldiers and Captain Zovax, locate Ethereum transponder Zeta and use it to establish contact with me to get your next set of orders. "
1309,A Colleague's Aid,Take the Charred Bone Fragment to Kalynna Lathred at Area 52 in Netherstorm. ,"There is a small detail I've forgotten to take into account.  The residue of Medivh's essence contained in this bone fragment is completely devoid of life - just like Arcanagos. There is a way, however.  And I know just the person to help us. Travel to Area 52 in Netherstorm and show the bone fragment to Kalynna Lathred.  She will know just what to do. "
1310,Summoner Kanthin's Prize,"Defeat Summoner Kanthin at Manaforge Duro, on the island to the north of Sunfury Hold, and reclaim the Stone of Glacius from him. ","The next thing we must do is reclaim my familiar, Glacius, from the blood elf summoner who holds it captive. Summoner Kanthin was one of the most senior magisters in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var. It's only natural that he would claim my familiar as a kind of trophy. I'm certain that Kanthin, fool that he is, has tried to compel Glacius to serve him. My scrying has revealed that Kanthin is now stationed at 'Manaforge Duro, ' if that terminology has any meaning for you. "
1311,A Promising Start,"Gather 15 Nether Dragonkin Eggs, then return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge. ","We've come here to investigate rumors of a strange breed of dragons, perhaps even descendents of Deathwing himself. These are clearly not ordinary black dragons, though. We'll know more once we've had a chance to examine their eggs. Their hatred for my flight runs deep, so I can't get close enough to gather the eggs. Will you agree to help? "
1312,The Annals of Kirin'Var,Retrieve the Annals of Kirin'Var from the town hall of Kirin'Var Village and return it to Custodian Dieworth. ,"Silencing the spirits has not bled them of their aggression as we had hoped it would. The malevolent spirits you subdued have reemerged in the streets of the town. We must uncover what is causing this to happen. The destruction of Kirin'Var was just the beginning, or else the spirits would have been quieted by now. The town hall in the southern section of Kirin'Var maintained a logbook of all the residents. Last I heard, it was in the keeping of Battle-Mage Dathric. Perhaps his spirit still has it. "
1313,Master Smith Rhonsus,"Apprentice Andrethan in Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill the ghost of Rhonsus, the town's master blacksmith. ","At last, my journeyman project is complete! I can't wait to formally present it to Master Rhonsus. <The apprentice looks at you as you describe your experiences retrieving the hammer. >They attacked you? All of them? By the Light, they've gone mad! What are we to do, <name>? It grieves me to say so, but it may be necessary to kill Master Rhonsus. It would leave me as the only smith in Kirin'Var, but I believe my training is sufficient to serve the town's needs. "
1314,In Search of Farahlite,Gather 4 pieces of Raw Farahlite and return to Zuben Elgenubi at the Stormspire. ,"To the northeast is an area called the Netherstone, a landmark not seen when this was a lush, green land. Newly-exposed crystal formations have shown us a mineral we've called farahlite in honor of this land's former identity. The tiny amount of farahlite we've mined has already proven popular with our clients. The highest grade of the mineral comes not from static deposits, but from the giants around the Netherstone. I can offer you a cut of the profits if you'll help supply the higher grade farahlite. "
1315,A Lingering Suspicion,Collect 10 Loathsome Remnants from the twisted spirits in Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard and bring them to Custodian Dieworth. ,"The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before. It's certainly not of blood elf manufacture. As you sense spirits moving closer to the building, the orb glows with a greater intensity, which fades as the spirits leave. There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts. How it works remains a mystery. Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations. "
1316,Ishanah's Help,Take Socrethar's Teleportation Stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light on the Aldor Rise in Shattrath City. ,"The time has come to face Socrethar, <name>.  Confronting an eredar leader isn't something that's taken lightly among us.  A single mistake is likely to cost us our lives if we're ill-prepared. Take Socrethar's teleportation stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light in Shattrath City.  She will determine how we need to handle the situation. "
1317,Bloody Imp-ossible! ,Bring 8 vials of Warp Chaser Blood to Sab'aoth at Cosmowrench. ,"The blood of the warp chasers in this area is a powerful and rare reagent. It's one of my biggest sellers. Normally, I take my imp, Zeppit, out to help me gather it. Warp chaser blood is simply too caustic to be handled safely by you or I, but it doesn't bother Zeppit. Things are getting busier here at the shop, so if I send Zeppit with you, will you help gather the blood? Zeppit's attention tends to wander, so you'll need to be close to the chaser when it dies for Zeppit to do his work. "
1318,Ar'kelos the Guardian,"Enter the Violet Tower at the center of Kirin'Var Village and defeat Ar'kelos, then speak with Archmage Vargoth. ","Now that you've gathered all the items I'll need to break Kael'thas's curse, one thing remains to be done. When Kael'thas sealed the tower, he placed an arcane golem, known as Ar'kelos, at the bottom of the tower. You must defeat Ar'kelos in order allow me to work magic within the tower again. When you enter the Violet Tower, the curse will begin to affect you. Once you have defeated Ar'kelos, ascend the tower and assist me in making preparations for the ritual. "
1319,The Sigil of Krasus,"Retrieve the Sigil of Krasus from Spellbinder Maryana at Manaforge Coruu, northwest of the Violet Tower. ","Before we departed Azeroth all those years ago, the Kirin Tor entrusted our expedition with a powerful artifact, the Sigil of Krasus. It was a great boon to us in our battle against the orcs and it could play a key role in helping me break the enchantment that imprisons me. However, when Kael'thas divested me of my possessions, he gave the sigil to Spellbinder Maryana, who remained behind with the garrison. If he truly realized what he had in his possession, he wouldn't have given it away so easily. "
1320,Netherologist Coppernickels,Speak with Netherologist Coppernickels at the bridge leading into the Netherstorm from Blade's Edge. ,"You must have crossed the main bridge into Netherstorm from Blade's Edge.  Did you see Netherologist Coppernickels working with all of his crazy equipment there? Strange. . . I've been expecting a report from him and it's overdue.  He's probably forgotten.  You know those 'science' types. Head back out to the bridge and pin him down.  Don't accept any of his excuses, just get me that report. Thanks! "
1321,An Audience with the Prince,Deliver the Surveying Equipment to the Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm. ,"Nexus-Prince Haramad has conveyed to me that he is interested in the immediate return of this property to him personally.  I would greatly appreciate if you would deliver it in my stead. It is a great honor to gain an audience with the nexus-prince, and I am sure that he would be keenly interested in hearing the tales of your adventures here in the Netherstorm. Seek out his chamber atop the Stormspire to the north.  He is often present as a holographic image, which you may address. "
1322,Down With Daellis,Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill Master Daellis Dawnstrike. ,"I'll never forget the blood elf who led the attack. He wore a tabard with a device I've never seen before, over top of crimson armor. He was ferocious and merciless, leading from the front where most other blood elf officers would never be seen. He was responsible for the deaths of many Kirin Tor mages that day, but he didn't linger long at Sunfury Hold. Kael'thas has ordered him to Manaforge Duro to aid in their attempt to control the area. Find him, <name>, and silence his bow for good. "
1323,Capturing the Keystone,Venture into Tempest Keep's Botanica and retrieve the Keystone from Commander Sarannis. ,"It doesn't surprise me that Kael'thas has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like Commander Sarannis. Prince Kael'thas is a great many things, but he is no simpleton. In order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter Tempest Keep and claim the keystone. Only once the keystone has been destroyed will I regain my freedom. "
1324,Recharging the Batteries,Use the Battery Recharging Blaster on enough Phase Hunters to get the Battery Recharge Level to 10. ,"I have the very important task of collecting the machinery inside these ruins, but I'm having a problem keeping all of my bots charged up. The phase hunters - those wyrm-looking things - have lots of energy!  You can find them all over the edges of this island, floating in from the nether. Fill the battery on this recharging blaster by using it on a phase hunter when they're very weak, and then finish it off to soak up the last of its energy. "
1325,Request for Assistance,Seek out and offer your services to Gahruj. ,"While you were at the Arklon Ruins, I received a request for assistance from one of our representatives out in the field.  It would appear that the Consortium is having some 'difficulties' in trying to recover property from the blood elves, which they refuse to pay for. Please head east out of Area 52 and cross the bridge to the next island over.  You'll find my associate, Gahruj, at the Midrealm Post, just inside of Eco-Dome Midrealm. "
1326,Securing the Celestial Ridge,Use the Challenge of the Blue Flight to provoke Veraku on the southern edge of the Celestial Ridge. ,"The nether dragons have the same ferocious temperament as their black dragon forbears, but there is something entirely alien about them. They hatch and mature rapidly, harnessing the strange energies that forged their kind in the destruction of Draenor. There is so much more I need to know about them, but I believe the powers may be of use to my own flight. If we can displace the leader of these drakes, Veraku, with a show of dominance, we can cow the rest of them into submission. "
1327,The Flesh Lies. . . ,Use the Protectorate Igniter on 12 Withered Corpses. ,"You see these corpses, <race>? Arconus is responsible for this slaughter. He's sucked them dry, leaving nothing more than a fleshy husk. But don't let the bodies fool you! Inside those corpses lie flesh beasts, waiting to pounce on the unsuspecting fool that gets too close. I've got my orders. I must remain here until backup arrives. That doesn't mean that you can't take my igniter and destroy the withered corpses that litter the mines. One way or another, the mission must be completed. "
1328,Captain Tyralius,Flesh Handler Viridius at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm has asked that you find and free Captain Tyralius. ,"Captain Tyralius took a platoon of soldiers south towards the Ethereum Staging Grounds 10 days ago. We haven't heard from him or his crew since. Chances are good that they were ambushed and killed but I'm getting a curious reading from my instruments. I think it's a distress signal but these things have been wrong before. If Tyralius is still alive, they're keeping him in one of their prisons. You'll have to locate the prison and open it with a key, probably found on the warden. "
1329,"Fel Reavers, No Thanks! ","Obtain 5 Condensed Nether Gas from Gan'arg Mekgineers at Forge Base: Oblivion, northwest of the Stormspire, and load them into a nearby Inactive Fel Reaver. ","Ah, yes - the fel reaver!  Certainly the Legion's most terrible mechanical creation.  There are no less than three of these abominations aimed at the Stormspire. Fortunately for us, they are not active yet.  This affords us the possibility of dealing with them through sabotage instead of brute force. Obtain condensed nether gas from the gan'arg at Forge Base: Oblivion and fill a nearby fel reaver's fuel tank with it.  I've a feeling its engine won't handle it too well. "
1330,Troublesome Distractions,Speak with Wind Trader Marid and lure him away from his trading post. ,"Your former employer, Wind Trader Marid, must've gotten wind that you're helping us now. Through my projection, I've seen his nether-stalkers entering the area, hoping to track us down. We've been able to evade them so far, but Marid must be dealt with before the problem grows more severe. If your impressions of Marid are correct, he'll do just about anything to secure the supply of his product. Return to him and tell him you're prepared to offer a deal. Lure him away and slay him. "
1331,Triangulation Point Two,Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the second triangulation point. ,"I've recalibrated the triangulation device with the information that you provided from the first point.  You'll use it in exactly the same manner to discover the second. All that I can tell you is that the second point is somewhere far to the west. Once you've located it, speak with Wind Trader Tuluman; another of the nexus-prince's agents.  He's posing as a weapon merchant at a small trading post next to the bridge, which leads to the island that Manaforge Ara is on. "
1332,Sunfury Briefings,Go to Manaforge Duro and retrieve the Sunfury Military Briefing and the Sunfury Arcane Briefing from the Sunfury units stationed there. ,"Something about these manaforges has been bothering me, <name>.  Naaru technology is incredibly advanced; it should've taken Kael'thas years to even begin to understand it. Information-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication. We've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by mana creatures.  It is possible that those defending it have not yet destroyed their briefings.  Obtain them and bring them to me. "
1333,Creatures of the Eco-Domes,Tag 12 Talbuks for Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire. ,"Your work with the lashers turned up some astounding information, but I wonder if it holds true for animals as well. Gathering information on the talbuks that live underneath this dome is going to be trickier than studying the lashers, I'm afraid. Using this tagging device, you can put a weakened talbuk to sleep and apply a tag that I'll use to track the animal as it matures. The tagging mechanism won't work unless the talbuk has expended most of its energy. "
1334,Declawing Doomclaw,Obtain Doomclaw's Hand and deliver it to Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm. ,"You know what might just discourage them?  Take out their leader! It seems to work everywhere else from what I've heard.  And when they see a <grizzled/tough> <class>, such as yourself take out their leader. . . why, I bet they'll tuck tail and run for the hills! Get back in there and take out the big one they call Doomclaw.  I hear he keeps himself in the eastern part of the Scrap Field underneath the pipe. Bring me his claw, too!  Maybe we can make use of it. "
1335,Distraction at Manaforge B'naar,Slay 8 Sunfury Magisters and 8 Sunfury Bloodwarders and return to Exarch Orelis at Area 52. ,"We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate the manaforges that Kael'thas' army is operating here.  Unfortunately, the Scryers threaten to renege on their information-gathering duties unless we support them with military action. We can't afford to compromise this mission over politics, so we've agreed to weaken the manaforge's defenses so that the Scryers can do their work. Prove your loyalty to the Aldor and slay the Sunfury magisters and bloodwarders that guard Manaforge B'naar. "
1336,Capturing the Phylactery,Recover Naberius's Phylactery from Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard district and bring it to Custodian Dieworth. ,"I suppose an explanation is in order. You've met one of the archmage's apprentices, Ravandwyr, but there was also another named Naberius. He was an ardent student, but was drawn to necromancy. When Kael'thas appeared with his forces, Naberius seized the opportunity to betray the archmage, handing over the secrets to the tower's defense. Now, it seems, he has become a lich. If we are to stop him, we must capture his phylactery. Knowing him, he would've buried it somewhere out of sight in his domain. "
1337,Socrethar's Shadow,Anchorite Karja at Area 52 wants you to obtain the First Half of Socrethar's Stone from Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion and the Second Half of Socrethar's Stone from Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna. ,"The infamous eredar, Socrethar, leads the Burning Legion in Netherstorm.  Mentioning his name is enough to make most draenei shudder.  He gives orders from an island in the northwest that only his most trusted lieutenants can access. To get there you will need to obtain a teleportation stone, which won't be an easy task.  The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion.  The second half is held by Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna. "
1338,Flora of the Eco-Domes,Use the Energy Field Modulator on Farahlon Lashers. ,"Just look around you, <class>! Isn't it amazing? Of course, this incredible resurgence of life is a byproduct of the ethereal domes, but imagine what it could do in the hands of the expedition. I'm preparing to negotiate with the ethereals for access to their technology, but I'd like to get a better idea of its effects on plant-based life. I've built a device to concentrate the dome's energies on the lashers in this area. Would you be so kind as to test it for me and share the results? "
1339,A Thousand Worlds,Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to bring him 5 Ethereum Prison Keys. ,"I have cracked the code! Each tag is broken up into several segments. The front side of the tag is always the same and states: ""A Thousand Worlds. . . "" I am unsure as to the meaning of this phrase but it sounds insidious. On the back side of the tag are the vital statistics. The first set of runes indicates location and the second indicates prisoner type. Furthermore, it would seem that the keys can be combined to form a special key that accesses another prison type. Now I just need more keys. . . "
1340,B'naar Console Transcription,Deliver the B'naar Console Transcription to Anchorite Karja at Area 52 in Netherstorm. ,"You try to transcribe the shapes as you see them flash across your eyes.  The results are less than exact, but should serve as adequate evidence to prove or disprove the Aldor's suspicions. "
1341,Formal Introductions,Find Tyri at the north end of the Celestial Ridge and speak with her. ,"Greetings, <name>. Do not be alarmed. This is merely a projection of my current form. It's the only way my companion and I could keep watch without revealing ourselves. The ethereal who approached you, Marid, is little better than a swindler in the guise of a legitimate merchant. I'd like you to consider working with me instead. My purpose out here is to find out more about the unusual dragonkin on this ridge. Meet me at the north end of the ridge and we will discuss this further. "
1342,Conjurer Luminrath,Locate Conjurer Luminrath's quarters in Wizard Row and return the mantle to his Dresser. ,"The cloak, undoubtedly of high elven craftsmanship, is richly tailored, even by the standards of the Kirin Tor. The symbols and characters sewn into the cloak's fabric hold no meaning for you, but clearly imbue the garment with magical properties. Perhaps this object binds the spirit of its former owner to this plane of existence. If so, returning it to the dresser in Conjurer Luminrath's quarters might break the spirit's link to this world, allowing it to rest. "
1343,The Unending Invasion,Search the mana creature infested area of Kirin'Var Village for a Mana Bomb Fragment and bring it to Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran. ,"Kael'thas's assault on Kirin'Var began with thundering noise and a bright flash of light in the officer quarters to the northwest. The destruction there was the most severe and after the withdrawal of the blood elves, a strange thing began to happen. Beings of pure mana began streaming into the village from all over the area. For now, we're containing them as we can, but with more information about the weapon Kael'thas used, I hope to cut off the flow of mana creatures entirely. "
1344,Delivering the Message,The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to escort the Protectorate Demolitionist to the Manaforge Ultris conduit and keep him protected while he works to sabotage the pipeline. ,I'm sending one of my demolitionists out to place the disruption device. Just make sure no harm comes to him as he's placing the disruptor. Keep him protected! He will not fight back if enemies attack him as he is only a holographic image but the image can be destroyed! Return to me once the job is done. 
1345,On Nethery Wings,Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to use your Phase Disruptor when you get in range of the Void Conduit that rests atop Ultris. ,"Here it is, <name>. Take this phase disruptor and mount up! The Protecotrate nether drake will fly you close enough to Ultris so that you can drop the disruptor on top of the void conduit. Drop as many disruptor charges as possible to ensure complete annihilation! When you are ready, speak with the nether drake and he'll take you up. If you miss the mark you will have to get more bombs from me before you can go up again. "
1346,Information Gathering,"Use the Sunfury Disguise, go into Manaforge Coruu and listen to the conversation between Commander Dawnforge and Arcanist Ardonis. ","I've prepared a uniform with the pieces you obtained.  It is magically enhanced to complete the illusion. We spotted Commander Dawnforge going in to meet Arcanist Ardonis a few minutes ago.  He had a full retinue of guards with him, so whatever they're discussing is bound to be incredibly important; see if you can catch any of it. Oh, I almost forgot.  You'll want to stay away from the arcane golems patrolling the manaforge.  They will see right through the illusion. "
1347,Full Triangle,Recover the Ata'mal Crystal and deliver it to the Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm. ,"With the data from both the first and second points, I'm now certain that the crystal is at the top of the Ruins of Farahlon to the northeast. Unfortunately, the data indicates that the crystal is moving, which means that it has already been discovered, probably by the Burning Legion! Just in case, I recommend that you take some friends along. Slay the demon that has the crystal and return it to Nexus-Prince Haramad. "
1348,Securing the Shaleskin Shale,Collect 5 Shaleskin Shale and give them to Boots at Area 52 in the Netherstorm. ,"I make a good living selling drinks to the boozehounds around here.  But I want something more! The rocket-chief is always telling me how he can't perfect the rocket fuel needed to get the X-52 off of the ground. We can solve that little problem for him. For starters I need to extract the oil from the shale of the local shaleskin flayers!  It'll form a concentrated, if explosive, base for the mix that I have in mind. Find the flayers, and their shale, all over the place near the purple rocks. "
1349,Ethereum Data,The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover the Ethereum Data Cell. ,"Look around you, fleshling. Very close to this transponder should be an Ethereum data cell. Locate that data cell, open it, and retrieve the contents. Bring it back to this transponder at once! "
1350,S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E,The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover 1 Prepared Ethereum Wrapping. ,We must destroy the machinery that is making these nexus-stalker aberrations possible. To strike at their proto-accelerator would be futile as it is an ethereal creation. We must instead destroy the manaforge energy tube that they are using as a conduit. I have all that I need to create a device to overload the conduit save for one item. I need a wrapping from an archon or overlord that might be transforming soon in order to calibrate the device. 
1351,Teleport This! ,Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to use the Mental Interference Rod on the Mo'arg at Forge Base: Gehenna and use their Detonate Teleporter ability on the three teleporters in the forge camp. ,"As fun as killing demons might be, it does us little good when the Legion can keep using its teleporters to replace anything we kill. Unfortunately, I don't have any high-powered explosives handy. . . but the mo'arg that maintain the teleporters do. Take this rod. . . I've tuned its powers to interfere with mo'arg brain frequencies.  Return to Forge Base: Gehenna and use it on any mo'arg you see.  You won't have long, but you'll be able to use their demolition charges on the nearby teleporters. "
1352,In A Scrap With The Legion,Kill 5 Mo'arg Doomsmiths and 15 Gan'arg Engineers. ,"The Burning Legion has moved in on our claim at the Scrap Field down the path and across the bridge to the east. This could be a huge problem for us!  With the Legion at the Arklon Ruins, and now there, it's starting to look bad for us - and the rocket project - here at Area 52. <name>, I need you to go out there and deal with those demons!  I'd do it, but I'm a lover, not a fighter. Yep, this is going to be trouble, I can feel it! "
1353,Sabotage the Warp-Gate! ,"Escort Drijya to the warp-gate at Invasion Point: Destroyer, and see to it that he is kept safe while he attempts to sabotage it. ","With the Burning Legion nearby at the fel reaver scrap field, we must do what we can to stop the flow of demons into the area. They have a warp-gate to the south in an area that they've cleverly named Invasion Point: Destroyer. I need you to go with me to the site and keep me safe while I sabotage it. Afterward, go to the Midrealm Post to the north inside Eco-Dome Midrealm and apprise Gahruj of our success. We're going to need a friend or two of yours along to help with this. "
1354,Deal With the Saboteurs,Mehrdad at Midrealm Post wants you to kill 8 Barbscale Crocolisks. ,"In searching the area for clues about the damage to our equipment, I've seen pieces of the shield generators at the bottom of the small lake to the north. I'm not sure why the crocolisks have taken an interest in the equipment, but we have to put a stop to this problem. The Consortium is quite clear on this matter. If it comes down to a choice between the equipment and crocolisks, the animals will have to go. I'll make it worth your while to deal with them. "
1355,Ethereum Prisoner I. D. Catalogue,I am in need of more I. ,"I am in need of more I. D tags, <name>. What I've discovered thus far is that this is not just a way to catalogue prisoners but it also documents locations! Once this code is broken we'll be able to pinpoint exactly where all of our allies are held and free them with minimal hostile action received. "
1356,Malevolent Remnants,Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to defeat 20 Severed Spirits in Kirin'Var's Town Square. ,"Most of the spirits in the village are little more than pale remnants of Kirin Tor mages. They retain no knowledge of their former selves and wander the ruins in blind anger. It wasn't always like this, though. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the spirits were restless, but not spiteful. With the passage of time they have only grown more aggressive. I dare not venture into the southern part of the village, for they will not spare even me. Quiet them and let us hope it will purge their anger. "
1357,Dealing with the Foreman,"Deal with Foreman Sundown inside the Trelleum Mine, which is underneath Manaforge Ara in the Netherstorm. ","The blood elves call the mine underneath Manaforge Ara the Trelleum Mine.  Ever since they lost the one underneath Manaforge Ultris, this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from. Needless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation.  Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves? Whatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with Foreman Sundown.  The mine is around the back of the island to the left. "
1358,Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar,Return to Manaforge B'naar and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis. ,"I was having a friendly discussion with the Aldor while you were gone.  Manaforges sure look like modified naaru technology from Tempest Keep.  Apparently, most naaru constructs have certain safeguards that allow them to be permanently disabled in case of emergency. The procedure is usually initiated at a control console via an access crystal.  Lo and behold, according to the roster you secured, such a crystal is in the possession of a fellow called Overseer Theredis.  Obtain it and see what you can do. "
1359,Arconus the Insatiable,Agent Ya-six at Access Shaft Zeon in Netherstorm has asked you to slay Arconus the Insatiable and return to Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm. ,"Araxes and I were deployed to Ultris 2 days ago. Our mission: Find and terminate the void lord Arconus. We tracked him to this mine and discovered that he'd been feeding off the energies of the creatures in the area. A fire-fight broke out which resulted in Araxes and I separating. Now I'm stuck here, badly injured. The mission is in shambles! If you can take out Arconus, high command would be grateful. Should you accept this mission, I will assist by providing a reflection of myself as a guardian. "
1360,Mark V is Alive! ,Escort the Maxx A. ,"Greetings, <race>.  I am charged up and fully functional. There are fragile draenei machines in these ruins, which I must retrieve.  I am equipped with delicate servos in my wrist actuators, and the latest in combustion-pneumatic bump soakers.  Handling them with care will not be an issue. However, the ghosts that haunt these ruins will likely attack, so I will need you and your friends along for protection. "
1361,Destroy Naberius! ,Custodian Dieworth in Kirin'Var Village wants you to confront and defeat Naberius in the village's Chapel Yard. ,"Archmage Vargoth saw the danger in Naberius 's pursuit of necromancy, but I don't think he ever anticipated that his own apprentice would wreak this much destruction upon the Kirin Tor. You must defeat him, <name>, or else he will continue enslaving the spirits of our fallen brothers, robbing them of their rightful rest and destroying what little remains of Kirin'Var. With his phylactery in hand, he can be confronted by two or three combatants, but who knows what his magic might do to more foes? "
1364,Battle of the Crimson Watch,Battle the forces of Illidan at Crimson Watch and survive! Return to A'dal at Shattrath City should you emerge the victor. ,"They are probably searching for you on the Path of Conquest as we speak. You must make your escape, <race>! Leave me, I'm done for. . . They. . . I think I hear them coming. It's now or never! Get out! If you choose to stay, you will have to fight! If you fight and somehow manage to survive, take what you have learned here and deliver that knowledge to A'dal in Shattrath City. "
1365,Dragonmaw Race: Captain Skyshatter,Follow Captain Skyshatter while attempting to stay on your flying mount. ,"You dare challenge Skyshatter? The world around you will fall into darkness as the heavens are torn asunder by my meteors. You stand no chance, soldier. Yet it is your desire to die. . . I will entertain this morbid obsession if only to prove a point to any that might foolishly dream of making the same mistake. We ride when you are ready! "
1366,Divination: Gorefiend's Armor,The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Armor. ,"In life, Gorefiend was a monster, but in death, Gorefiend was an unmitigated terror. To the southeast you will find Netherwing Ledge. What was once part of the mainland of Shadowmoon is now a floating island in the sky. Vhel'kur, spawn of Deathwing, once called it his home, but now knows it as his grave. He flies an endless circle above the island, seething at his defeat to Gorefiend. If you are to recover the Gorefiend's armor, it is Vhel'kur that you must defeat. "
1367,The Journal of Val'zareq: Portends of War,"Locate Marcus Auralion, High General of the Sha'tar, at Crimson Watch. ","This journal documents the recent activities of Illidan's armies. It also explains why Val'zareq was parading around the Path of Conquest. He was personally responsible for the capture of a high general of the Sha'tar. This general is being held at a post known as Crimson Watch, located at the southern end of the Path of Conquest. A mysterious faction, calling itself the Crimson Sigil, is charged with his incarceration. If you choose to investigate, it would be wise to bring allies. "
1368,The Cipher of Damnation,Use the Cipher of Damnation at the Altar of Damnation to summon Cyrukh the Firelord. ,"How many times has this spell been used in the history of our worlds? Undoubtedly, its power for destruction is unparalleled. What you must do now is take the cipher, now made whole, and read from it at the Altar of Damnation - where the memory of Gul'dan stands. What you will see once the words are uttered are the memories left imprinted upon the land. Stand your ground and await the coming of Cyrukh. You must be victorious, <name>. This land cannot withstand another shattering. "
1369,The Great Netherwing Egg Hunt,Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover a Netherwing Egg. ,"Should you discover any Netherwing eggs while exploring, bring them to me. Be warned, a Netherwing egg is a rare discovery. Do not become frustrated if you cannot locate one. These Dragonmaw have been very thorough in collecting most of them and shipping them off to parts unknown. Eggs might be found on creatures of the island, near crystal formations, in the mines, or even inside a nethercite node or netherdust bush. Keep a low profile. We don't need Mor'ghor catching wind of your actions. "
1370,Learning to Fly,Speak with Olrokk at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying <his/her> own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place. I understand the feeling completely. You, my friend, need to head to Shadowmoon Village in the northwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Olrokk about some flight instruction. Mind you, his training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while. "
1371,Learning to Fly,Speak with Ilsa Blusterbrew at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying <his/her> own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place. I understand the feeling completely. You, my friend, need to head to Wildhammer Stronghold in the southwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Ilsa Blusterbrew about some flight instruction. Mind you, her training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while. "
1372,Divination: Gorefiend's Truncheon,The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Truncheon. ,"One by one they knelt before him, offering their lives as a show of allegiance. Gorefiend hoisted his sickle and cut clean their heads. Shortly after this slaughter, Gorefiend took his own life. But this was no act of contrition! No, Gorefiend sought immortality! From the corpses of the fallen death knights rose the Ghostriders of Karabor. They now ride the roads encircling the Hand of Guldan, awaiting the day that their master returns. It is they who hold the truncheon of Gorefiend. Retrieve it. . . "
1373,"Teron Gorefiend, I am. . . ","Teron Gorefiend, I am. ","With Gorefiend's items restored, there is but one last piece to this puzzle: A host. <The ancient shadowmoon spirit 's lips curl up  to form a wicked grin. >Surely you did not believe the fairy tale that I told you. The Altar of Shadows is my prison. Without your help, I would have been stuck here for all eternity. Now, I will take over your body and you will destroy my captors and break these bonds.

1374,Kindness,Mordenai at Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to feed 8 Mature Netherwing Drakes. ,"Something has them spooked, <race>. < Mordenai points to the nether drakes flying overhead. >They won't even come down to feed. I have seen several fall to the earth, dead from exhaustion before their bodies hit the ground. We must save them! The Rocknail flayers that are found near the crystals are their natural prey. Kill flayers and take their carcasses. Place a carcass in the field and stand extremely still. As long as you do not make any aggressive motions, they will not attack you. "
1375,The Soul Cannon of Reth'hedron,"Illidari Lord Balthas at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 2 Felsteel Bars, 1 Adamantite Frame, 1 Khorium Power Core and 1 Flawless Arcane Essence. ","Reth'hedron now lords over the Twilight Ridge of Nagrand. An eredar of such power being loosed upon this world does not bode well for the Illidari. Alas, we do not have the resources required to slay Reth'hedron. Not with the war the Sha'tar have brought to the Black Temple. No. . . I have a better plan. You will subdue Reth'hedron, banishing him back through the Twilight Portal. For this a soul cannon must be fashioned. Return to me with the materials on this list. "
1376,Divination: Gorefiend's Cloak,The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Cloak. ,"Many a cruel act he committed but none so cold as the slaughter of the clerics of Karabor. After Gul'dan's Horde defeated the draenei of Karabor, the surviving clerics of Karabor were marched out, told that they were to be taken to Hellfire Citadel as prisoners of war. Gorefiend, not yet a death knight, murdered each and every last one of them in cold blood. They now roam in front of the Black Temple with vengeance in their hearts. It is the clerics of Karabor that hold the cloak of Gorefiend. "
1377,Karabor Training Grounds,Karabor Training Grounds is the first quest in the Book of Fel Names questline. ,"Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor.  Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss. Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself.  I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons.  We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not. "

1379,Bring Down the Warbringer! ,"Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold. ","We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council's operations at the Deathforge, but if we're to truly be triumphant, we'll need to defeat the Legion's overseer there. I found a key among the items in Flanis's pack. I'm certain it will prove useful in tracking down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold. After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Wing Commander Nuainn. He'll want to know immediately! "
1380,Netherwing Crystals,Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 30 Netherwing Crystals. ,No good at nothin'? That's fine.

1381,Karabor Training Grounds,Karabor Training Grounds is the first quest in the Book of Fel Names questline. ,"Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor.

Inside are Lohn'goron and the second part of the cipher. He will be sad to hear news of my death. Promise me that you will assure him that I died a free soul.

"
1384,Additional Materials,"David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge wants you to bring him an Adamantite Frame, 4 Heavy Knothide Leather, and a Demon Warding Totem. ","The ingots that you brought contain most of the metal I'll need to forge the sword's blade, but I'll need a variety of things to create other parts of the weapon. Let's see, among the things I don't have here are an adamantite frame, some heavy knothide leather, and a demon warding totem. Skilled crafters should be able to produce the first two, but the third is only sold by the reagent vendor in Shattrath's Lower City, Fantei. You'll find him with the other tradesmen. "
1385,The Ata'mal Terrace,Go to the top of the Ata'mal Terrace in Shadowmoon Valley and obtain the Heart of Fury. ,"It has been known to us that the fel orcs, under Illidan's command, have guarded an Ata'mal crystal known as the Heart of Fury at the Ata'mal Terrace.  They cloud its presence with dark magic, to keep it from the Sha'tar. Fight your way to the Ata'mal Terrace outside the Black Temple and turn your eyes to the sky.  Shadowlord Deathwail will circle the terrace, beyond your reach.  You will have to slay him and his warlocks before you can obtain the crystal. It won't be easy, <name>.  I wish you luck. "
1386,Dissension Amongst the Ranks. . . ,Dissension Amongst the Ranks. ,"Researcher Tiorus was kind enough to put this concoction together for the final strike. I merely pour it upon this tabard that you have provided for me and the item is imbued with the essence of the Illidari filth. Take the enchanted tabard and travel to the Eclipsion Fields, southwest of Eclipse Point. Once there, use the tabard to transform into an agent of Illidan. While in disguise, slay the crazed colossi that wander the field. They will think it an attack by the Eclipsion and sever all ties! "
1387,The Secret Compromised,Travel to the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley and speak to Akama. ,"Thanks again, <name>.  I recognize your name. Akama has entrusted you with his plans and so I will trust you as well. The naga discovered I was working against Illidan and tried to get me to speak by torturing me.  I did not tell them a thing - Akama himself taught me to master pain through meditation. Illidan asked the naga to bring me to him.  He would have seen right through my flesh and into my soul's deepest secrets. Akama must be warned.  Our plans are in jeopardy! "
1388,Accepting All Eggs,"We don't need those eggs to get into the wrong hands, &lt; name&gt; . ","You are a true hero, <name>. "

","Thank the Earthmother! I parted ways with the others several days ago. I was intent on discovering the source of the disturbance that the spirits of water were feeling. My search led me to Coilskar where I discovered that the naga were befouling the water supply of Shadowmoon Valley. Unfortunately, I was discovered and taken prisoner. There's no telling what ghastly things they had in store for me. We must leave this place! Help me escape and then seek out Torlok at the Altar of Damnation. "
1390,The Summoning Chamber,Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a Deathforge Smith or Deathforge Tinkerer and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning  chamber. ,"In order for the Shadow Council to construct infernals as quickly as they're being used, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the corrupted elementals that serve as the souls of the creatures. The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics. "

Its effects are devastating when attuned. This one is attuned to my blood. The same blood flowing through the veins of Reth'hedron - my brother. Aye, his misplaced allegiance will be the end of him. Take the cannon and fly to the Twilight Ridge in western Nagrand. Locate Reth'hedron and fire! You must stay on your mount and within range for the effects to take hold. Stand your ground against him and he will have no choice but to flee! "
1392,The Fel and the Furious,Use a Fel Reaver Control Console to take control of a Fel Reaver Sentinel. ,"< Plexi leafs through the manual. >Well, this has everything we need, but there's just one problem. Fel Reavers aren't really built to respond to remote control. We can modify one for you to use for a short time, but you'll have to work fast, or there's no telling what might happen! I wouldn't be surprised if your little stunt with the fel reaver catches the attention of the Legion's lackeys, either. Keep an eye out, and whatever you do, don't forget to destroy as much as you can! "
1393,Quenching the Blade,Travel to the Scalding Pools located near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan and use the Forged Illidari-Bane Blade to quench it in the lava pools. ,"The blade is nearly finished! You can almost feel the magic beginning to coalesce inside the steel, but one thing remains to be done. You must take the forged blade to the Scalding Pools near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan in Shadowmoon Valley and plunge it into the lava pools to quench the sword. When you have quenched the sword, return. "
1394,To Legion Hold,Make your way to Legion Hold and locate the Legion Communication Device. ,"The fortress of Legion Hold is nigh impregnable, and to be completely honest, I can't spare the forces for an assault. Our hopes are riding on you, <name>. What little information we've been able to gather indicates that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and learn about their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. Good luck, <name>. "
1395,Tablets of Baa'ri,Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to collect 12 Baa'ri Tablets from the ground and from Ashtongue Workers at the Ruins of Baa'ri. ,"The Ashtongue Broken have been ordered by Illidan to excavate the Ruins of Baa'ri, to the far north.  They're in search of draenei artifacts, no doubt - Baa'ri was home to many Baa'ri relics before Gul'dan buried the town under a volcanic explosion.  We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor. . . a place you might know as the Black Temple. "
1396,The Fate of Flanis,Stormer Ewan Wildwing at Deathforge Tower wants you to search the Deathforge for Flanis Swiftwing and recover Flanis's Pack. ,"Wing Commander Nuainn originally sent three of us out here to keep watch over the Deathforge and to gather information. Flanis Swiftwing volunteered to try to infiltrate the Deathforge, but we haven't heard anything from him in days. I fear the worst, <name>. Flanis is a skilled scout, but if he's gotten in over his head, we have no way of knowing. Search the Deathforge for him and recover any information or items he might have collected. "
1397,Tablets of Baa'ri,Anchorite Ceyla at the Altar of Sha'tar wants you to collect 12 Baa'ri Tablets from the ground and from Ashtongue Workers at the Ruins of Baa'ri. ,"Years ago, the dreaded warlock known as Gul'dan raised the volcano in the middle of Shadowmoon.  The draenei village of Baa'ri, to the southwest, was buried under the lava along with its inhabitants and artifacts of religious importance. The treacherous tribe of Broken known as the Ashtongue has been ordered by Illidan to excavate the area.  We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor, now known as the Black Temple. "
1398,The Hand of Gul'dan,Speak with Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"The elements need your help, <race>! Shadowmoon Valley has been subject to unspeakable evils.

1399,Thwart the Dark Conclave,"Slay the Dark Conclave Ritualists and use the Staff of Parshah to end the Dark Conclave's summoning ritual, then return to Parshah in the Magma Fields. ","The spirits of the dark conclave seek to summon an ancient and powerful evil through a ritual conducted at the lava pits to the south of the Sketh'lon Base Camp. Gul'dan's magic mingled with their own, empowering them to aid this creature in manifesting in our world! We must not allow this to happen, <name>.

1400,The Path of Conquest,Travel to the Path of Conquest in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"My gryphon riders have come back with a bit of news! The Eclipsion blood elves are planning something big. They've begun forming their armies at the Path of Conquest, located east of here - adjacent to Eclipse Point. I want you to travel to the Path of Conquest and assess the situation. Once you've done so, use this flare gun to signal a gryphon rider. One will swoop down from the sky to meet you. Tell 'em what you've discovered and they'll give you the next set of orders. "
1401,The Hand of Gul'dan,Speak with Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"The elements need your help, <race>! Shadowmoon Valley has been subject to unspeakable evils. The spirits remain tortured to this day. Many are enraged and unwilling to commune with the Earthen Ring. Help this world heal, friend.

1402,To Netherwing Ledge! ,"Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to collect 12 Nethervine Crystals from Netherwing Ledge. ","I believe that I can imbue nethervine crystals with my own essence. The power contained within these imbued crystals should be sufficient to free enslaved drakes of their masters' grasps. Travel to Netherwing Ledge, an island located off the broken shelf of Shadowmoon Valley, to the southeast. It is on Netherwing Ledge that you will find nethervine crystals. Return to me when you have collected enough crystals to fill your packs. And <name>, Beware the Dragonmaw that now inhabit the island. "
1403,"Teron Gorefiend, I am. . . ","Teron Gorefiend, I am. ","With Gorefiend's items restored, there is but one last piece to this puzzle: A host. <The ancient shadowmoon spirit 's lips curl up  to form a wicked grin. >Surely you did not believe the fairy tale that I told you. The Altar of Shadows is my prison. Without your help, I would have been stuck here for all eternity. Now, I will take over your body and you will destroy my captors and break these bonds. Refuse and we will both be stuck here forever. Teron Gorefiend will be free! "
1404,Imbuing the Headpiece,"Equip the Unfinished Headpiece, travel to the Altar of Damnation, and use it while standing near Gul'dan. ","The staff is nearly finished! All that remains is to imbue the headpiece with power flowing from the echoes of Gul'dan in this accursed place. To the east, near the Fel Pits and south of the Deathforge, is the Altar of Damnation. There, fragments of Gul'dan's past are trapped. When you carry the unfinished headpiece of the staff into the area around the altar, don't be surprised if some of the entities react to it. You will be carrying a dangerous object with strong connections to the cataclysm. "
1405,Blast the Infernals! ,"Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in Legion Hold, then report to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold. ","The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power. If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals. "
1406,Varedis Must Be Stopped,Varedis Must Be Stopped is the final quest in the Book of Fel Names quest chain in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"Of course we must destroy this book, but not before we use it to destroy Varedis. If we're to shut down this academy of Illidan imitators, we'll have to deal not just with Varedis but also the three night elf masters that assist him: Alandien, Theras and Netharel. Gather a suitable force and return to the Ruins of Karabor.  Follow Altruis's instructions for defeating Varedis.  Hopefully his plan will work - otherwise. . . it'll have been a pleasure working with you. "
1407,Bow to the Highlord,Speak to Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"I am unworthy to even carry a message directed at you, sir. Please forgive me for this indulgence. Overlord Mor'ghor has requested your presence in his chambers at once! "
1408,Enraged Spirits of Fire and Earth,Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 8 Earthen Souls and 8 Fiery Souls. ,"We must try and make amends. We must commune with the elements of this region and see if anything can be done! I grant you the totem of spirits, <race>. If you slay an enraged elemental spirit in close proximity of the totem, it will consume the elemental's soul. You must use the totem to consume many souls before you may return to me. Do this for the spirits of fire and earth first. Return to me when the totem is full. "
1409,Zuluhed the Whacked,Kill Zuluhed the Whacked and recover Zuluhed's Key. ,"He hides in my thoughts, mortal. He waits for me to break. . . for me to bend to his will. And this will be his undoing. I will call for him. I will tell him that I will do as he asks. When he appears, kill him and take the key! Know this: Zuluhed is an ancient orc with unknown powers.

1411,To Legion Hold,"Make your way to Legion Hold, locate the Legion Communication Device, and learn about the Legion's plans while in disguise. ","The fortress of Legion Hold is your target. You'll have no reinforcements, so a frontal attack is out of the question. What little information we have shows that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold.

1412,A Mysterious Portent,Return to Akama at the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"Before he died, Udalo appears to have written a single word on the floor beneath him.  The writing is barely legible but you recognize the word Atam'al. Perhaps Akama will understand the meaning of his brethren's message. "
1413,The Cipher of Damnation - The Third Fragment Recovered,Take Borak's Lockbox to Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"Take this box to my father. He still resides at Oronok's Farm, far to the north, above Coilskar Cistern. When all three fragments are pieced together, the ancient words will be known once more. Good luck, <name>. Tell my father that I will be home soon. "
1414,A Necessary Distraction,Exarch Onaala wants you to return to the Ruins of Karabor and find a way to unleash Azaloth on his captors. ,"The weapons are authentic, as we feared.  Illidan is training demon hunters at the Ruins of Karabor and we must put an end to it. Do not be fooled by their name, <name>, their power will be used against us as often as against any demon. Their warlocks summon and subdue demons to be used as part of the initiates' training.  A pit lord named Azaloth has proven too strong to be used in training and is kept banished.  Find a way to let him loose on his captors.  That should buy us the time we need. "
1415,Return to the Aldor,Speak with Exarch Onaala at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"This book. . . I could use it to increase my power tenfold. . .  No!  It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of.  Return to those who sent you here, <name>. You now have the means to stop Varedis.  Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence.  That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power. "
1416,The Hermit Smith,Bring the Box of Ingots to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge in Terokkar Forest. ,"<Ordinn examines the results from his attempt at smithing the metal and shakes his head. >This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated for your use. There was a talented smith who accompanied the Sons of Lothar to Draenor, David Wayne. He was a remarkable blacksmith, but chose to leave the expedition. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you with the weapon. "
1417,Blast the Infernals! ,"Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in Legion Hold to destroy the infernals, then report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.

1418,The Fate of Kagrosh,Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to search the Deathforge for Kagrosh and recover Kagrosh's Pack. ,"The scouting party originally had three members. Unfortunately, Kagrosh decided he wanted to be a hero. He descended into the Deathforge and we haven't heard from him since. In all likelihood, the fool's gone and gotten himself killed. The Shadow Council members aren't idiots and Kagrosh wasn't exactly strong in the subtlety department, if you know what I mean. Keep an eye out for him in the Deathforge and recover any information or items he might have collected. "
1419,A Ghost in the Machine,Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 15 Ever-burning Ash samples. ,"I fear that these dwarves do not understand what they have built upon. This area was once the ancestral grounds for the Shadowmoon orcs. I speak of spirits, <race>. For nearly twenty years they have laid dormant beneath the Wildhammer Stronghold, but recently, something has riled them up. Venture beyond the gates of Wildhammer and seek out the pools and rivers of fel lava found across this land. Near the lava will be ever-burning ash. Bring me this ash so that I may craft something that will help us. "
1420,Zuluhed the Whacked,Kill Zuluhed the Whacked and recover Zuluhed's Key. ,"He hides in my thoughts, mortal. He waits for me to break. . . for me to bend to his will. And this will be his undoing.

He has surely been empowered further by Illidan. You risk your life for me in doing as I ask. Are you certain you wish to make such a sacrifice? "
1421,The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid,Assist Commander Hobb and the Scryers in defending the Sanctum of the Stars. ,"Take these Scryer medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of ""victory"" once this is over.

Just give me the word. "
1422,Bring Down the Warbringer! ,"Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. ","We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council here at the Deathforge, but now it's time to finish the job. I found a key among the items in Kagrosh's pack.

1423,Find the Deserter,Locate Parshah in the Magma Fields and speak to him. ,"I get the feeling that all the pieces are here, but I just can't put them together in a way that makes sense. I think our best lead is to attempt to locate this deserter. If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning. Start your search for him along the road in Magma Fields to the northwest. It seems a likely place for him to take refuge. "
1424,The Cipher of Damnation - Borak's Charge,"Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the Third Part of the Cipher of Damnation from Ruul the Darkener.

The Dragonmaw Fortress is directly east of here, across the Netherwing Fields. Somewhere between Dragonmaw Fortress and the Sanctum of the Stars is where you'll find Ruul. Strike hard and strike fast! And <name>, from the sound of it, this Ruul is going to be tough. Keep your guard up. Return the Cipher to me should you succeed. "

By order of Thane Yoregar, the fel beast, Uvuros, is to be killed on sight and his mane stripped from his carcass as proof of deed.

",We must study these creatures further. Far to the east - near the huge lava flow beneath the ruins of Baa'ri - you will find arcano control units. These controllers were crafted by a genius named Gnomus for the sole purpose of exploring lava via mechanical scorpion. He has long since lost his mind and is now only interested in eating the hottest food known to gnome-kind. <Tiorus gives you a funny look. >I want you to use the control and tag the diemetradons of the lava flow for further study.

We do not know what happened to Gorefiend after he returned to Draenor. The only thing we are certain of is that he has already died once. I have heard the scouts here speaking of an ancient orc spirit that resides at the Altar of Shadows, far to the east, across the Netherwing Fields and through Netherwing Pass.

While the outright slaying of them would draw far too much unwanted attention to you, there is a way that we can thin their numbers and remain below the suspicious eyes of Mor'ghor. Venture into the wilds of Shadowmoon Valley and slay the tainted wildlife. Take from them their corrupt fel glands. Use those fel glands with this mutton that I'll give you near the peons. They'll take one bite and fall deathly ill! "
1431,Seeker of Truth,Find a Murkblood Overseer and interrogate him. ,"These miners are far too stupid to concoct any type of escape plan. We must find and punish the source. Venture into the depths of the mine and seek out the Murkblood overseers. If they have not been overcome by the denizens of the mine, they will undoubtedly be hiding. Once you locate one, interrogate him until he reveals the true mastermind behind the escape. Return to me with the identity of this traitor and the hand of the overseer. "
1432,Fresh from the Mechanar,David Wayne at Wayne's Retreat wants you to bring him an Overcharged Manacell. ,Working with the ingots you brought is going to require a lot of heat -- rather more than a conventional forge can supply. I'm going to need a supplemental heat source for the forge and there are very few things in Outland that can supply that kind of power. The Mechanar area of Tempest Keep turns out manacells containing an incredible amount of power. Find one of the overcharged manacells from the stacks around Mechano-Lord Capacitus and bring it back here. 
1433,Akama's Promise,Bring the Medallion of Karabor to A'dal in Shattrath City. ,"<Akama inserts the crystal into the medallion in his hand. >I am not as strong as I once was, <name>.  Being so close to evil itself all these years - I do not know if I can trust myself with an artifact as powerful as this. Take this as my promise to you that when the time comes and you face Illidan, I will be on your side.  Take it to the one being we know we can trust with its power.  Take the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City. "
1434,Setting Up the Bomb,"Obtain a Fel Reaver Power Core and a Fel Reaver Armor Plate, then bring them to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. ","We can't allow the Legion to trample us on their march to Black Temple. Find a way to destroy the infernals they intend to use against us. That's not a request, <name>; it's an order. The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the basis for a kind of fel bomb. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for a section of armor plating. You should be able to make a bomb powerful enough to take out those infernals and give the hold a nice shake! "
1435,A Job Unfinished. . . ,Slay 10 Overmine Flayers and Barash the Den Mother. ,"In the name of our great master. . . For the glory of Illidan! By order of Overlord Mor'ghor, the great plateau of Netherwing Ledge is to be secured. With all Netherwing drakes captured or forced off of the land, rock flayers are running rampant and threatening crystal harvesting operations. Destroy them all, their den mother and her consort, Arvoar. Mor'ghor commands it! <It would appear that this orc failed to take the plateau. It is time to prove your worth to Mor'ghor! >"
1436,Minions of the Shadow Council,Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to kill 10 Deathforge Guardians and 5 Deathforge Summoners. ,"<Zagran listens to you recount the events at Legion Hold, nodding. >That fills in the gaps we've seen. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that. The Shadow Council has the forge pretty much locked down. Looks like you're going to need to fight your way in. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge! "
1437,Bane of the Illidari,Wait for David Wayne to finish forging a sword for you. ,<David gathers his smithing supplies. >You've done well in getting everything we'll need to reforge the anti-demon blade. Your hard work and dedication is about to be repaid. The time has come to forge the sword. 
1438,Netherdust Pollen,Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 40 Netherdust Pollen. ,"A flower picker? ! Hilarious. . . Unfortunately, our mages and shaman need your services. The netherdust bushes that grow on this ledge have special pollen that is apparently very useful in their magical dealings. Bring me that stuff and I'll consider your work order complete. "
1439,The Not-So-Friendly Skies. . . ,Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 10 Netherwing Relics. ,On the northeast edge of this island exists a dock used for the packaging and transport of Netherwing crystals and relics. Dragonmaw Transporters transport the goods from the dock to Dragonmaw Fortress while Dragonmaw Ascendants guard the ground from any would-be attackers. This leaves one opening for you to make a strike at the Dragonmaw: The Dragonmaw Skyway. Fly to the shattered islands of the Dragonmaw Skyway and ambush the transporters that use the route. Recover our stolen relics! 
1440,Ata'mal Armaments,Smith Hauthaa needs you to produce 5 Cleansed Ata'mal Metal. ,"The Ata'mal Terrace in eastern Shadowmoon Valley is holy to the draenei, but is now overrun by fel orcs. They have dug up the special ore from that place and created corrupted weapons and armor. I need the armaments to form an alloy with the naga ore. Our anchorites have blessed my anvil with the ability to cleanse them. Retrieve the armaments from the Shadowmoon chosen, slayers and darkweavers. Return them here, breaking down and purifying them upon my anvil, and then hand me the cleansed results. "
1441,The Cipher of Damnation - Grom'tor's Charge,"Grom'tor, Son of Oronok at Coilskar Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the First Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation. ","This naga filth is the sixth one I've interrogated today. He's got the fancy armor so I figured he knew something. Those other ones were useless. <Grom'tor points to the corpses of the naga around him. >I only had to beat him once and he told me everything. The first part of the cipher is hidden in a naga chest at Coilskar Point or Coilskar Cistern, east of here. He says naga carry the keys.

","It is a sign, <name>. Even in death, I cannot be stopped. Recovering a part of the Cipher of Damnation is my destiny. With your help, that destiny will be fulfilled. Before we embark on that journey, I must have my longbow, Lohn'goron. It is a family heirloom that has been handed down from Torn-heart to Torn-heart for generations. My instinct tells me that a demon stole it from my corpse. Kill the demons here until you find my bow. "
1443,A Necessary Distraction,Larissa Sunstrike wants you to return to the Ruins of Karabor and find a way to unleash Azaloth on his captors. ,"The weapons are authentic, as we feared.  Illidan is training demon hunters at the Ruins of Karabor and we must put an end to it. Do not be fooled by their name, <name>, their power will be used against us as often as against any demon. Their warlocks summon and subdue demons to be used as part of the initiates' training.  A pit lord named Azaloth has proven too strong to be used in training and is kept banished.  Find a way to let him loose on his captors.  That should buy us the time we need. "
1444,Sunfury Signets,Battlemage Vyara at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to bring her 10 Sunfury Signets. ,"The survival of the Scryers hinges on outrecruiting Kael'thas.  Every pilgrim from Quel'Thalas that joins his side brings him closer to victory.  The opposite is true for us. Soon, however, we will run out of recruits and it will come down to what side can kill the other quicker.  Prove your worth to the Scryers by bringing me Sunfury signets worn by  high-ranking blood elves allied with Kael'thas and Illidan.  You'll find them at Eclipse Point to the west and the Ruins of Karabor, to the northeast. "
1445,"Grom'tor, Son of Oronok","Find Grom'tor, Son of Oronok at Coilskar Point in Shadowmoon Valley. ","My first born, Grom'tor, left to search Coilskar Point - directly southwest of here. He's the warrior in the family - ill-tempered and blood-thirsty. . . Traits he inherited from his mother. Search along the outskirts of Coilskar Point. If you see naga corpses, Grom'tor is sure to be close. When you find him, tell him this: ""We spill blood for just cause. "" It will let him know that you are a friend to Torn-heart and prevent your premature death. "
1446,The Summoning Chamber,Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a Deathforge Smith or Deathforge Tinkerer and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning chamber. ,"In order to churn out infernals as quickly as the Deathforge seems to, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the elementals that form the core of the infernals. The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics. "
1447,A Distraction for Akama,Ensure that Akama and Maiev enter the Black Temple in Shadowmoon Valley after Xi'ri's forces create a distraction. ,< Xi'ri pulses with lights as the Aldor and Scryer forces around him respond to his orders.

1448,"Ar'tor, Son of Oronok","Find Ar'tor, Son of Oronok at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley. ","My youngest son, Ar'tor, left to search Illidari Point - far to the southwest, nestled between Legion Hold and Wildhammer Stronghold. While Ar'tor is a hunter of remarkable skill and an expert tracker, I fear that he may be in over his head this time. Illidari Point is the proving grounds for Illidan's demons. These are demons that left the Burning Legion to join the Betrayer! Travel to Illidari Point and find Ar'tor, <name>. "
1449,A Haunted History,Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring her 15 Ever-burning Ash samples. ,"Have you felt the cold chill? Perhaps what you thought was a hand on your shoulder? That was not your mind playing tricks on you, <race>. The land is haunted. Ghosts litter the landscape, stuck here for all eternity. Would you like to see them? Are you sure about that? These types of things tend to change a person - and not for the better. Very well, I will need you to collect for me the ever-burning ash that is found near any of the fel lava pools of western Shadowmoon. Anywhere near green lava. . . "
1450,"Wanted: Uvuros, Scourge of Shadowmoon",Slay Uvuros and recover Uvuros's Fiery Mane. ,"Wanted - DEAD: Uvuros, scourge of Shadowmoon Valley. By order of Overlord Or'barokh, the fel beast, Uvuros, is to be killed on sight and his mane stripped from his carcass as proof of deed.

I will bestow a piece of my spirit upon you, hero. It will guard you and help you in your battle against evil. You must then travel south of here towards the back of Illidari Point.

I could use it to increase my power tenfold. . .  No!  It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of.  Return to those who sent you here, <name>. You now have the means to stop Varedis.  Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence.  That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power. "
1454,Breaching the Path,"Slay 20 Eclipsion Soldiers, 10 Eclipsion Cavaliers, and 5 Sons of Corok. ","We're going to need more time, <race>. I'm going to fly further ahead with some of the other gryphon riders. Hopefully, we can gather some more information. What I need from you now is to clear a path and more importantly, keep their arrows pointed away from us! Call for a gryphon rider with the Wildhammer flare gun once you have thinned their numbers. "
1455,Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress,"Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to slay 15 Dragonmaw Orcs. ","I require time so that I may devise a plan to save my children and mate. You will buy me this time, mortal. Venture into Dragonmaw Fortress, located on the eastern edge of the Netherwing Fields, and lay waste to all Dragonmaw orcs that you find. The ensuing chaos and confusion should have a considerable impact on their plans. Be warned, some of my kin are too far gone - their minds corrupted by the Dragonmaw. For them, the only resolution is death. You have my permission to end their lives as well. "
1456,In Service of the Illidari,This is one of the first quests you'll receive as you go from Neutral to Friendly with Netherwing. ,"Netherwing Ledge. . . What was once a bastion of sanctuary for the Netherwing is now home to the Dragonmaw. While the orcs may have control of our territory, our magic there is still strong. Strong enough to cloak your true identity and allow you to infiltrate the ranks of Dragonmaw. I have prepared this letter for you to present to their leader, Overlord Mor'ghor. Fly headlong into the maw of our enemy and seek out Dragonmaw Base Camp to start your new life as a fel orc of Illidan Stormrage. "
1457,Capture the Weapons,Ordinn Thunderfist at Wildhammer Stronghold wants you to bring him Mazakradon's Glaive and Morgroron's Glaive. ,"With a larger supply of this material, we might be able to forge a weapon for you to use. The two pit lords at Legion Hold, Makazradon and Morgroron, have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. We have no way of knowing how many more the Legion intends to produce, but if we can capture these prototypes, there should be enough for our project. <Ordinn grins. >There's a certain amount of satisfaction in using the Legion's own 'secret weapons' against them, don't you think? "
1458,The Lexicon Demonica,Obtain the Lexicon Demonica from Grandmaster Vorpil and bring it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge. ,"Recreating the enchantments on the blade requires several spells to be spoken in demonic. It's not something I was taught during my training as an apprentice, but there's no way around it. There's a book, called the Lexicon Demonica, that will provide most of the words I need, but it's in the hands of a powerful Shadow Council warlock. Deep in the halls of Auchindoun's Shadow Labyrinth, it is held by Grandmaster Vorpil. Do whatever you must to secure the book and bring it to me. "
1459,Dissension Amongst the Ranks. . . ,Dissension Amongst the Ranks. ,"Gnomus was kind enough to put this concoction together for the final strike. I merely pour it upon this tabard that you have provided for me and the item is imbued with the essence of the Illidari filth. Take the enchanted tabard and travel to the Eclipsion Fields, southwest of Eclipse Point. Once there, use the tabard to transform into an agent of Illidan. While in disguise, slay the crazed colossi that wander the field. They will think it an attack by the Eclipsion and sever all ties! "

","Didn't think we'd leave you to face the fel orc army by yourself, did you? <Yarzill's eyes flicker a translucent blue. >Aye, we are here with you, <name>. For every service you perform for the fel orcs in your quest to reclaim Netherwing lands, we'll be at your side to make sure that they suffer a sufficient setback. You'll need to keep a low profile so as not to draw any unwanted attention to yourself during your sabotage missions. "
1462,Enraged Spirits of Air,Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 10 Airy Souls. ,"Venture southeast, hero. When you see fields of gigantic blue crystals jutting out from the land, you will have reached your destination. It is there, at the Netherwing Fields, that you will find the enraged spirits of air. They roam the cliffs and mountain bases that surround the fields. Destroy their tortured forms and capture their souls with the totem of spirits. Return to me when this is done. "
1463,"Hail, Commander! ",Speak with Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley. ,Captain <name>! <Taskmaster Varkule salutes you. > Overlord Mor'ghor has asked to see you in his chambers at once! 
1464,Special Delivery to Shattrath City,Deliver the Ata'mal Crystal to A'dal on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City. ,"I am an ethereal of my word, <name>.  You have truly inspired me. I am now going to give you the ata'mal crystal to hand over to the naaru.  As it was your heroics that made this possible, I wish for you to deliver it. You may use my personal teleporter to go directly to Shattrath City.  Simply step through it and you will be transported there. Give the crystal to the naaru known as A'dal on the Terrace of Light.  May the trade winds be at your back. "
1465,City of Light,Follow Khadgar's servant and listen to its story. ,"Do not burden A'dal with petty inquisitions, <class>.  That just might be the most powerful being you ever come face to face with. You do not look familiar.  I suppose you want to learn about the city? You'll have to excuse me if I don't give you a tour myself, but I'm a bit busy discussing strategy with A'dal.  Perhaps you'll find a summoned servant acceptable in my stead?  Excellent! "
1466,The Second and Third Fragments,Obtain the Second Key Fragment from an Arcane Container inside Coilfang Reservoir and the Third Key Fragment from an Arcane Container inside Tempest Keep. ,"I hid the second fragment at the bottom of Serpent Lake, long before it was called that.  The giant drain installed there after the naga took over has likely pulled the container into the depths of Coilfang Reservoir. The third fragment will prove the most trying, as I left it inside Tempest Keep back when it was controlled by the naaru.  Kael'thas now rules it and the chamber where I left it has become a prison. Bring me these remaining fragments, <name>.  Much depends on your success. "
1467,A Cleansing Light,Bring a Fel Armament to Ishanah in Shattrath City. ,"This temple is one of the holiest places in all of Outland.

1468,Synthesis of Power,Voren'thal the Seer in Shattrath City wants you to obtain an Arcane Tome. ,Arcane tomes are not ordinary books that happen to deal with arcane matters.  There is intrinsic power in them - a power I've learned to synthesize into a single arcane rune. Should you find an arcane tome in your travels I will give you one such rune.  Only the most powerful wielders of magic carry the books I need.  In Outland this usually means Kael's blood elves - but you'd be surprised by where such tomes often turn up. 
1469,Fel Armaments,"Have you run into any fel armaments lately? &nbsp; Let the Light do its work, &lt; name&gt; . ",The fel materials are removed from this world.  Only the Light's residue remains.

Well it doesn't matter. Yes I lied to you and no I don't have the book. Not anymore, anyway. It was stolen. Probably by one of those filthy refugees. Besides, Auchindoun is now defunct. We have no use for the book. If you find it, you can keep it. Like I said, I saw some of those ruffians snooping around the terrace last week. Start your search with them. They're probably playing dice in the slums. "
1471,Firewing Signets,Magistrix Fyalenn in Shattrath City wants you to bring her 10 Firewing Signets. ,"It is no secret that Kael'thas Sunstrider perceives us as a great threat.  Let's face it - not many sin'dorei, fresh from Silvermoon, are willing to join the sort of company that Kael keeps. It's also no secret that this is not just a war of words.  Scryers and the armies that serve Kael'thas attack each other on sight.  The only way to prove you're with us, <name>, is to do your share of fighting. Kael's lower ranking followers wear Firewing signets to indicate their rank.  Bring them to me. "
1472,Return to Khadgar,Return to Khadgar in Shattrath City and show him the Master's Key. ,"I seem to have memories about future events surrounding you and this key. < Medivh looks at you like he's just seen a ghost. >You have trying times ahead of you, <name>.  Let us hope your strength does not fail you. Regarding the key, I am to hand it to Khadgar when he's sent to me.  I couldn't hope for a better apprentice. I suppose you will need a key of your own. < Medivh reaches into his robe and hands you his own key. >Go on then.  And best of luck, <class>. "
1473,Assist Exarch Orelis,"Assist Exarch Orelis is an Aldor-only breadcrumb quest leading to Distraction at Manaforge B'naar, which is part of a long chain ending in Deathblow to the Legion. ","Not long ago, High Priestess Ishanah sent a small group of anchorites to Netherstorm, under the command of Exarch Orelis. They were to investigate the activities of Kael'thas and his minions, but we haven't received any reports of their findings yet. I worry that our presence in the area might not be strong enough to carry out the mission. I'm certain that the exarch could benefit from your knowledge and experience. Are you willing to travel to Area 52 and assist him? "
1474,Allegiance to the Aldor,"Are you certain of your choice, &lt; name&gt; ? &nbsp; The Aldor will welcome you as an ally, but the Scryers will not easily forgive your decision.

1475,Sunfury Signets,Magistrix Fyalenn in Shattrath City wants you to bring her 10 Sunfury Signets. ,"As you might know, the Scryers and the armies of Kael'thas are at war.  Kael sees us as a threat to his influence over other blood elves and has tried to crush us time and again. If you wish to aid us in our battle against Kael'thas, there are plenty of targets for you to go after.  Kael's highest ranking soldiers wear Sunfury signets to mark their ranks.  You will find them all over Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley. "
1476,Marks of Kil'jaeden,Bring 10 Marks of Kil'jaeden to Adyen the Lightwarden in Shattrath City. ,"As you probably know, <name>, the Aldor are keepers of the Light and servants of the naaru. Diametrically opposed to us are the agents of the Burning Legion - demons bent on the destruction of worlds and the corruption of the innocent. If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of low-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers.  We know of a Shadow Council hideout in the Bone Wastes and there are many Legion outposts in Nagrand and the Blade's Edge Mountains. "
1477,More Venom Sacs,Many refugees still need treatment for their poisonous wounds. ,"You have my thanks, <name>.  The naaru have extended their protection to these unfortunate souls; it would be a shame if they made it to Shattrath and perished to previous wounds. "
1478,Strained Supplies,Bring 8 Dreadfang Venom Sacs to Sha'nir in Shattrath City. ,"More and more refugees come through the gates of Shattrath City each day.  Some have sustained such injuries, it's a real wonder they made it here. I can deal with most of the conventional injuries; my training as an Aldor healer has prepared me for that.  Poison wounds are more problematic as my anti-venom supplies have begun to run low. Bring me venom sacs from the local dreadfang spiders so I can produce more antidotes.  You'll find a pocket of the spiders in the southeastern region of Terokkar. "
1479,Alicia's Poem,You have been asked to deliver Alicia's Poem to Caylee Dak in Shattrath City in Outland. ,"Hi, I wrote a poem for my friend Caylee.

1482,Arcane Tomes,"Have you obtained any more arcane tomes, &lt; name&gt; ? A level 70 Shattrath City Quest. ",The power contained in this tome is tremendous.  Yet it is easily condensed into a single rune by one with a clear mind.

His prophetic visions warned him that Kael's path would lead to the destruction of our race. The visions are usually vague and unfocused, but our alchemists have devised an elixir to help him focus his clairvoyance.  Unfortunately, this elixir calls for a rare ingredient: basilisk eyes.  My usual source, this pathetic ethereal, has failed me. Seek the dampscale basilisks in the rocky regions of Terokkar and bring me their eyes. "
1484,More Sunfury Signets,"What have you done for us lately, &lt; name&gt; ? &nbsp; The war against Kael'thas is not going to fight itself, you know? A level 70 Shattrath City Quest. ",Excellent!  That'll show Kael'thas not to underestimate our power. 
1485,A Cure for Zahlia,Bring Stonegazer's Blood to Sha'nir in Shattrath City. ,"The woman to my right suffered a severe injury to the head.  She survived, but lost her eyesight. A traditional cure used among my people requires the blood of a very old basilisk. Unfortunately, due to poaching from various groups, Terokkar basilisks don't tend to live very long. There is one basilisk whose name I've known since I was a youngling.  It is known only as ""Stonegazer"" and it's rumored to live east of here, near the land's edge. Bring me its blood so that Zahlia may see once again. "
1486,Threat from Above,Slay any 20 Gordunni Ogres in the Barrier Hills and return to Yuula in Shattrath City. ,"So you want to join the Skyguard?  Well, I know you can fly. . . but can you fight? The Skyguard is sworn to protect Shattrath from the dangers that loom above us, both near and far.  The Gordunni ogres who dwell in the Barrier Hills to the north are an immediate threat to us. Reaching the ogres has been problematic for Shattrath's ground units.  That's where we come in.  See what you can do to help contain them. "
1487,Suraku the Azure Netherwing Drake,"It is an honor to meet you, &lt; name&gt; . ","It is an honor to meet you, <name>.

1534,Hazzik's Bargain,Obtain Hazzik's Package at his dwelling in eastern Skettis and return to him with it. ,"Do not draw attention to our conversation.  Adaris would not approve.

I always believed this to be the mere legend, <name>.  The return of the talonpriests and your recovery of this tome indicate otherwise. With each day, Terokk comes closer to returning to full strength.  Your only chance is to bring him to our world prematurely.  Return to Skettis and speak to Adaris about this.  Let us hope he has the wisdom to do the right thing. "
1539,Escape from Skettis,Escort the Skyguard Prisoner to safety and report to Sky Sergeant Doryn. ,"Hail, <name>.  I thank you for coming to my aid. The arakkoa's monstrous birds knocked me from my nether ray while on a scouting mission. Let's get out of here, while we can. "

Unfortunately the war on Skettis is taking a toll on them. We have dozens of sorties a day - the poor fellows rarely get a break.  And with recent shortages on feed, if those blasted birdmen don't kill them on a mission then starvation will. If you can lend a hand, take one of our rays to the woods in the south.

1555,Orgrimmar,Grand Apothecary Putress wants you to give the Dual-plagued Brain to Apothecary Karlov in Orgrimmar. ,"We have a breakthrough!  Our zombie specimens have given new insight into the nature of the Scourge's plague.  They have born rotten, delicious fruit. . . Take this box to Orgrimmar.  Inside is a head that is infected with the zombie plague, and something else we have devised -- an anti-plague.  The two plagues battle within the zombie brain, and that brain is the key to a cure, I am certain of it. Bring the box to my assistant, Apothecary Karlov.  He attends Thrall in Orgrimmar. "

1557,The Undercity,Grand Apothecary Putress wants you to give the Dual-plagued Brain to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity. ,"The zombie plague was a blessing in disguise.  In our search for a cure, we have learned so much of the Scourge and their contagion.  Our research has given us weapons against them.  Weapons, and tools. . . Take this -- it is a zombie's head and has been partially cured of its plague by injecting it with a compound derived from our recent discoveries.  Deliver the head to Master Apothecary Faranell; I have a list of experiments I would like him to perform on it. "
1558,A Desperate Alliance,Speak with Bishop Lazaril in the new Alliance camp at the Terrace of Light in Shattrath. ,"Good <name>, the Lich King plagues us --  both Horde and Alliance -- with disease and invasion.  Only by joining our strengths can the two great cultures of Azeroth survive against his assault. In Shattrath, in the Terrace of Light, that alliance has been struck.

1561,zzOLDHunting Tarot: Lesser Beasts,Collect 12 Torn Hides and then summon the Huntsman with the Hunting Tarot. ,"Staring into the card, the image blurs until you see yourself standing covered in the furs from many wolves and bears.  You can only assume this is your destiny should you invoke the tarot's power. "
1562,A Desperate Alliance,Speak with Bishop Lazaril in the new Alliance camp at the Terrace of Light in Shattrath. ,"Good <name>, the Lich King plagues us --  both Horde and Alliance -- with disease and invasion.

1564,Rather Be Fishin',Bring 8 Pristine Shimmerscale Eels to Seth in Shattrath City. ,"Speaking of lakes, there's a lake with real good fishin' up to the northeast. I used to go up there with my friends, but my mom won't let me go anymore. She says it's too dangerous, but I haven't seen anything up there but a few little spiders. Like spiders can do anything to you. . . My favorites were always the eels that live up there. If you're going to be up by the lake, would you think about bringing back some of the eels? They're feisty but once you subdue 'em, you can bring 'em back no problem. "
1565,Vengeful Souls,High Priest Orglum wants you to journey into the Tomb of Lights and defeat 5 Vengeful Draenei. ,"The Tomb of Lights has become corrupted by the Shadow Council and the draenei dead have become cursed spirits, angry and confused with a burning hatred for the living. Enter the tomb and seek out these tragic victims. Give them the rest that they deserve. "
1566,The Impotent Leader,Jorin Deadeye has asked that you find and speak with Kilrath. ,"I have escaped certain death, surviving a cowardly nighttime attack by Boulderfist ogres upon my village. But I ask you, stranger: For what? <Jorin points to Garrosh. >He has refused to give us assistance. Ogres are rampaging through my town and he sits here, weeping into a fire. What has become of us? What will become of us? I've sent a scout, Kilrath, to the village, now the Bleeding Hollow Ruins. Will you find him and give him your assistance? He hides on the border of Nagrand and Terokkar. "
1567,The Big Bone Worm,Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes wants you to recover Enormous Bone Worm Organs. ,"I was right! These carcasses you brought me belong to the baby bone worms. Do you know what that means? It means that somewhere out there is a big one! I think we can get it to come out if we can provide the right kind of food. Let's see. . . something big! Yes! I remember seeing clefthooves east of here on the other side of the Bone Wastes. Get out there and kill a clefthoof. Once it's dead, use the drums. Hopefully the big one will come up to feed. If you manage to kill it, bring me its organs! "
1568,Skywing,Escort Skywing and report to Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath City. ,Skywing flutters around you. You get the feeling he wants you to follow him. 
1569,Torgos! ,Call down Torgos with Trachela's Carcass. ,"There's a creature in the Bone Wastes so fearsome that only the dauntless dare to stalk him. I speak of Torgos, king of the bonelashers, who circles over Veil Rhaze on the western edge of the wastes. Too bad that there's an arakkoan scarecrow there, known as Torgos's Bane, which keeps him at bay.  I'd bet if you laid his mate Trachela's carcass at the foot of that scarecrow he'd come down anyway.  She can be found at Carrion Hill in the northern wastes. Bring me one of Torgos's tail feathers. "
1570,Don't Kill the Fat One,Kilrath in Terokkar Forest has asked that you kill 10 Boulderfist Invaders and beat Unkor the Ruthless until he talks. ,"I have been watching these beasts for days. The fat one says that he is waiting for something. What he is waiting for, however, is a mystery. I have a plan but it is going to involve some violence on your part. You will need to kill several of his subordinates and then beat him within an inch of his life. Do this and I am certain he will tell us everything that we need to know. "
1571,A Personal Favor,Retrieve 5 of Lathrai's Stolen Goods. ,Hmmm?  A box you say?  Or was it several?  Do you know what material the box was constructed from? And what was the name of this merchant?  Empoor?  Are you certain that he's one of the Broken?  I don't do much business with their kind. Perhaps my memory would be jogged if you were to do me a favor? The Skithian arakkoa - primitive casters that they are - recently stole a huge shipment of my more exotic goods.  I want it all back! You can find Veil Skith just to the south of Shattrath City. 
1572,Crackin' Some Skulls,"Sal'salabim at Shattrath City wants you to recover Raliq's Debt, Coosh'coosh's Debt and Floon's Debt. ","< Sal'salabim laughs. >This Sal'salabim design. < Sal'salabim points to the architecture and formations on the blueprints. >Look at towers. Demon hunter no can see, yes? Poor, poor Altruis. He cry if he had eyes, yes? Yes, Sal'salabim help but first you help Sal'salabim. < Sal'salabim gives you a ledger. >These creatures owe Sal'salabim golds. Many golds. Go collect for Sal'salabim and come back. They no give you Sal'salabim gold easy. Have to fight, but you strong. You defeat Sal'salabim! "
1573,The Outcast's Plight,Bring 30 Arakkoa Feathers to Vekax in Shattrath's Lower City. ,"As an outcast, I am marked by death by arakkoa loyal to the city of Skettis.  I cannot leave these walls for fear of my life, but that doesn't mean I cannot strike at them in retaliation. I have a small cache of treasure that I'm willing to part with, should you help me strike back at my would-be assassins.  Bring me feathers from the denizens of the various Veils of Terokkar as proof of their demise. "
1574,More Feathers,"Skettis's lapdogs still keeps a close watch over us, outcasts. ","< Vekax squawks in glee as you present him with proof of his enemies' demise. >Yes, that will show Skettis that we Outcasts will not take their punishment lying down.  Here is the reward I promised you.  I can arrange for more, should you provide me with additional feathers. <This quest can be repeated up to Honored reputation. >"
1575,Veil Lithic: Preemptive Strike,Break the cursed eggs in Veil Lithic. ,"In the wretched colony to the southwest known as Veil Lithic, Terokk's minions are attempting to befoul their avian brethren before they hatch. The dark sorcerers of Lithic encase eggs in a shadowy curse. When the hatchlings emerge, they mindlessly serve Terrok. Travel to Veil Lithic and prematurely break the eggs before the curse has time to seep in. Even if you are too late, you can put down the tainted ones. Remember, the Light shines brightest in the darkness. "
1576,The Final Code,Sergeant Chawni wants you to use the Final Code Sheet to set off the Mana Bomb. ,"They're building a second mana bomb in the courtyard.  My intel suggests that the final code for the bomb is being held by Sharth Voldoun, the overseer of the project at Firewing Point. <name>, you have to go back in there and retrieve the final code from him.  He keeps himself to the top of the highest spire. Take the final code to the mana bomb that they're working on in the central courtyard and set it off. Only then will we be certain that Stonebreaker Hold is safe. "
1577,Investigate Tuurem,Find the Sealed Box and then deliver it to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside of the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest. ,"You know, come to think of it, I do recall selling several boxes of strange and exotic engineering parts to Empoor about a month ago.  I'm not sure what they'd be used for, but I know that they were delivered to Tuurem. Perhaps one or more of those boxes is still there? "
1578,Who Are They? ,"While in disguise, speak with the Shadowy Initiate, the Shadowy Laborer and the Shadowy Advisor. ","I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile! I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor. Just watch out; there're a few hunters in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village -- the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another. "
1579,Evil Draws Near,Oakun wants you to take the Dread Relic to the Writhing Mound. ,"Now you must use the Dread Relic in a foul necromantic ritual if you wish to challenge Teribus the Cursed.  To the northeast, beyond Auchindoun, is the Writhing Mound, a place where necromancers gather. The auchenai death-speakers and doomsayers carry doom skulls that are laced with powerful necro-enchantments.  If you collect enough skulls you can use their power along with the power of the Dread Relic to command Teribus to face you. "
1580,Spirits of Auchindoun,Help the Alliance secure a tower in the Bone Wastes. ,"Auchindoun's spirits have no stake in the conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, but incurring their favor will give our side an edge in the region. Ancient custom directs the living to pay their respects at spirit towers in the Bone Wastes - though only at specific times of the day.  If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will have helped bring the spirits to our side. Should we succeed in gaining the spirits' favor, they will grant us a boon that will aid us in our endeavors. "
1581,Veil Skith: Darkstone of Terokk,Use the Rod of Purification on the Darkstone of Terokk in Veil Skith and return to Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes. ,"Veil Skith lies to the northwest of the caravan and to the south of Shattrath in a secluded grove of the forest. It is rumored that the colony of Skettis has constructed a maligned altar of worship. This Darkstone of Terokk must be purified if the arakkoa of Skith are ever to be redeemed. Take this Rod of Purification and cast it upon the Darkstone. Blessed by A'dal, the rod's purity might be enough to bring clarity to the Darkstone. Go now and may the light shine upon thee. "
1582,It's Watching You! ,Kill Naphthal'ar and then return to Warden Treelos at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest. ,"Quick, hide!  The eyes of Naphthal'ar are upon you. . . upon us all! I dare not go to the top of the tower to speak with it, but you. . . you look as if you might know the right words to say.  Just be careful, it doesn't like jokes and will not suffer fools easily. If you can, convince it to come down for tea.  But, by all means, get it to stop staring at me! "
1583,The Elusive Ironjaw,Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold. ,"Now that I have the fur I'll need for the trim, I've been thinking that the pelt of a particular wolf would make a good hood for my cloak. Imagine seeing your enemy clad in the pelt of the most cunning predator in the forest! I've tried trapping old Ironjaw without success. I've tried cornering him, outsmarting him, and baiting him. None of it has worked. He stalks the northeastern reaches of the forest, and I'd gladly reward you if you could succeed where I have failed. "
1584,Rediscovering Your Roots,"Mar'nah at Sun's Reach Harbor wants you to travel to Razorthorn Rise in Outlands, collect 5 Razorthorn Roots, and return to her. ","My stocks are presently sufficient, but I'll need plenty of razorthorn roots to keep up with the demand. Collecting the roots is difficult, but I know a special method of extraction. Using the glands of the Razorthorn flayers, one can control a ravager there and use it to expose a root. To find the roots, travel to Outlands and fly northeast from Shattrath until you reach Razorthorn Rise. Return to me, <name>, once you have collected five of the roots. "
1585,The Eyes of Skettis,Bring the Eye of Reskk and the Eye of Shienor to Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City. ,"Doom harkens from the cliffs of Skettis. My people, the arakkoa, face a fate shrouded in unspeakable evil. Too often have we abused dark magic for wrongdoing. Through A'dal I have learned of the Light and of redemption. Terokk watches his colonies from Skettis through orbs enchanted by the black art. Steal these Eyes from Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor in northern Terokkar. Let me see what Terokk sees. Let me look through the eyes of Skettis. "
1586,By Any Means Necessary,Find Empoor on the road between Tuurem and Shattrath City in Terokkar Forest. ,"I don't know what to make of all of this, but I do know how we can find more clues. Empoor is a Broken merchant that traffics in all sorts of goods and information.  If you were to persuade him to talk, I'm sure he might have something interesting to say. He travels the road here between Tuurem and Shattrath.  Watch out, though -- he travels with a bodyguard. "
1587,Welcoming the Wolf Spirit,Use the Ceremonial Incense near the candles in Malukaz's hut and observe the ceremony. ,"I've nearly completed the vestments that I'll wear during the ceremony. As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left. I believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans. I can almost imagine my ancestors using it in a ceremony paying tribute to the wolf spirit after a successful hunt. Once you've placed the incense, I'll begin the ceremony. "
1588,The Shadow Tomb,"Go into the Shadow Tomb, west of the Refugee Caravan and retrieve the Drape of Arunen, the Gavel of K'alen and the Scroll of Atalor. ","Many believe it was the Shadow Council that caused the explosion that tore Auchindoun apart.  It is rumored they awoke a great evil inside. If that is true, then that evil must have turned against them.  According to these orders, part of the Shadow Council is fleeing Auchindoun.  They are using the Shadow Tomb to store powerful artifacts from Auchindoun. Three of these are sacred, for they belonged to the powerful patriarchs Arunen, K'alen and Atalor.  I must ask you to retrieve them. "
1589,A'dal,"Speak to A'dal, the leader of the Sha'tar, in the center of the Terrace of Light. ","Welcome to Shattrath City, <class>.  This might be the one place in all of Outland where you'll find any semblance of safety. A group of naaru known as the Sha'tar drove the demons away from here. If you've never met a naaru, you ought to see A'dal inside the Terrace of Light.  The leader of the Sha'tar is an awe-inspiring sight if I ever saw one.  Sure is a change of pace from anything else in this bleak land. "
1590,The Tomb of Lights,High Priest Orglum wants you to journey to the Tomb of Lights and kill 10 Ethereal Nethermancers and 10 Ethereal Plunderers and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan. ,"To the east, buried under the charred sand, is the Tomb of Lights, a lost resting place of the dead.  Before our caravan was ambushed I was going to journey to the tomb and cleanse it of evil spirits. Little did I know it was already infested with another kind of evil.  Even now the ethereals plunder the bodies of the fallen for trinkets and keepsakes that were given to the dead centuries ago. There is little I can do while our caravan struggles to survive. "
1591,Strange Energy,Collect 4 Teromoth Samples and 4 Vicious Teromoth Samples. ,"Something strange has changed the teromoths of the thicket. Where once there was a diversity of life in there, now only the teromoths remain.  And while before they were at peace, now they are agitated and will not hesitate to attack you should you get close. I need to compare the vicious ones to the normal.  Collect for me a number of samples from both.  You'll find the unaffected teromoths both to the south and the north. I'm certain this is related to whatever killed all of the druids. "
1592,What Are These Things? ,Deliver the Box of Parts to Tooki at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ,"I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are.  I do know one thing though - they look dangerous! <name>, I think you should take this box of parts to Tooki at Stonebreaker Hold to the southeast.  He may have some idea of what these are. "
1593,What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket? ,Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest. ,"We haven't heard from the druids at the Cenarion Thicket of Terokkar Forest in quite some time. <name>, I'd like for you to go down there and check in with them to see what's happening.  There are several ways to get there, but the fastest is to head south along the path, and then take the road that branches east from Shattrath City once you're in the forest. "
1594,Who Are They? ,"While in disguise, speak with the Shadowy Initiate, the Shadowy Laborer and the Shadowy Advisor. ","I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile! I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor. Just watch out; there're a few hunters in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village -- the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another. "
1595,What Happens in Terokkar Stays in Terokkar,Shadowstalker Kaide wants you to kill 10 Bonechewer Devastators and 6 Bonechewer Backbreakers. ,"If word reaches Thrallmar that they've failed to contain the fel orcs, we're going to be receiving a lot of company down here. Frankly, I'm not sure I want all that attention, so we're going to keep this little problem under wraps, got it? If we can inflict enough casualties on the fel orcs, chances are their presence will never come to the attention of anyone outside Stonebreaker. So, let's end it now. Wade in there, swing your weapon, wave your hands, or whatever it is you do - just kill fel orcs. "
1596,Spirits of Auchindoun,Help the Horde secure a Spirit Tower in the Bone Wastes. ,"The draenei might be our enemies, but the spirits of their ancestors in Auchindoun are restless and have no allegiance. The draenei's custom required them to pay their respects at spirit towers at various times during the day.  If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will help the spirits return to peace in Auchindoun. The Alliance will try to capture the towers in order to secure the dead's favor.   We must ensure that our side succeeds instead. "
1597,Clues in the Thicket,Investigate the Strange Object next to the Broken Corpse to determine what might have befallen the Cenarion Thicket. ,"I have no idea what killed all of the druids here.  I've been away for a couple of days on a survey of the Bone Wastes to the south. Please, you must help me to uncover what's behind this horrible tragedy.  Go into the thicket and look for a clue that might reveal something to us.  When I was in there briefly, I could have sworn I saw a dead Broken and a strange object next to him. And don't worry about Treelos - he might have been driven insane by what happened, but I think he's mostly harmless. "
1598,It's Just That Easy? ,Sal'salabim at Shattrath City wants you to return to Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand. ,"< Sal'salabim points to the blueprint. >You see where fel cannons are? < Sal'salabim draws an arrow denoting a change of direction. >You turn fel cannon around and use on structures. Wait! Don't be mad! One thing you not know. Overseers have key to turn cannons. You need key first! One from each overseer! Not so easy, eh? Take information back to Altruis. "
1599,The Final Code,Lieutenant Meridian wants you to use The Final Code to set off the Mana Bomb. ,"They're building a second mana bomb in the courtyard.  My intel suggests that the final code for the bomb is being held by Sharth Voldoun, the overseer of the project at Firewing Point. <name>, you have to go back in there and retrieve the final code from him.  He keeps himself to the top of the highest spire. Take the final code to the mana bomb that they're working on in the central courtyard and set it off. Only then will we be certain that the Allerian Stronghold is safe. "
1600,More Arakkoa Feathers,Bring 30 Arakkoa Feathers to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold. ,"I've had some success drawing the arakkoa spirits closer to me, but they are still very shy. Perhaps if I improve my disguise, they will be more willing to approach me in the trance. To do that, though, I'll need more feathers like the ones you've already brought me. If you get any more of the feathers, I'd be very happy to take them off your hands. "
1601,Can't Stay Away,"Speak with Isfar, who can be found near the entrance to the Sethekk Halls in Auchindoun. ","I tried to persuade Isfar to remain here, in the safety of Shattrath, but he would have none of it. Instead, he's decided to venture out to Auchindoun again on his own. He was lucky enough to escape the Sethekk Halls once, but if they discover him, there won't be a second time. I admire his desire to free his sister, but he's not going to be able to do it without help. Find Isfar and have a word with him, <name>. If you can't persuade him to come back, perhaps you could help him rescue Lakka? "
1602,Escaping the Tomb,Help Akuno find his way to the Refugee Caravan. ,"I appreciate your help, <name>.  I was certain I was going to be killed. Let's get out of here with a hurry.  It won't be long before more cultists come after us. "
1603,Torgos! ,Call down Torgos with Trachela's Carcass. ,"I want Torgos, king of the bonelashers, dead! Not long ago, while I was out hunting at Veil Rhaze on the western edge of the wastes, he fell upon me. <Mawg taps his eyepatch. >He took my eye, and now I would have his life!  Bring me one of his tail feathers as proof and I'll give you a worthy reward. You'll need his mate Trachela's carcass though to call him down as he's deathly afraid of the old arakkoan scarecrow known as Torgos's Bane. Find her at Carrion Hill in the northern wastes. "
1604,Fumping,Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes wants you to bring him 8 Mature Bone Sifter Carcasses. ,"How would you like to do a little more work for the Explorers' League? These bone worms have us all quite intrigued. I've got a drum right here that you can use out in the Bone Wastes. Just bang on the damned thing and see what you get. If it's a worm, kill it and bring back the carcass for us to study. We'll need a good lot of carcasses to get a valid testing sample. "
1605,Veil Shalas: Signal Fires,Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan wants you to extinguish the four signal fires of Veil Shalas. ,"Terokk's perch, Skettis, looms above the Bone Wastes to the east. At the base of Skettis lies Veil Shalas, the most formidable of Terokk's colonies. It is through the stronghold of Veil Shalas that Terokk's forward sages wage war against the Light. The evil-doers of Shalas communicate with their master using a complex system of magical signal fires. Travel to the east, <race>, and extinguish the fires. Once Veil Shalas is silenced, we can begin to plot the fall of Skettis. But I get ahead of myself. "
1606,Escape from Firewing Point! ,Escort Isla Starmane to safety and then report to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ,"Thank goodness for you! <class>, I need you to help me escape.  I have information vital to the security of Stonebreaker Hold and probably all of Outland! I came here from the Cenarion Expedition on a diplomatic mission, but as you can see, they weren't very friendly.  If you help me get to safety, I can assure you that you will be handsomely rewarded! We won't be able to do this on our own - you do have a group with you, right? "
1607,The Skettis Offensive,Hold off the attackers and speak with Rilak the Redeemed. ,Skettis has waged war on us! Have you gathered enough to help with Shattrath's defense? Hold off the attackers! 
1608,Tokens of the Descendants,Collect Time-Lost Scrolls from the time-lost arakkoa in Skettis and bring them to a Skull Pile inside a summoning circle in Skettis. ,"The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book.  Gezzarak the Huntress, Garokk the Crystal Giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vekkaz the Windrager.  They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world. You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa and burn them at the summoning circles all over Skettis.  Bring me a token from each one.  These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends. "
1609,The Dread Relic,Oakun wants you to travel east to the Derelict Caravan to recover the Dread Relic. ,"Long ago a caravan went to Auchindoun with a mission to take a Dread Relic from the ancient tombs beneath the necropolis. They fled, but the relic was their undoing.  The relic is evil and it summons evil when touched.   Their caravan was destroyed somewhere to the east. This dark artifact is the key to a terrible plan to defeat Teribus the Cursed, a creature that flies over the Bone Wastes.  Help me if you wish, but your life and even your soul will be at risk. "
1610,Terokkarantula,Vindicator Haylen wants you to kill the Terokkarantula and then return to him west of Netherweb Ridge. ,"You have slain many of the dreadfang widows but they will continue to spawn and soon they will strike at us again.  Deep within Netherweb Ridge is the lair of the Terokkarantula, the brood-mother of these gruesome creatures.  If we are to be safe, she must die. "
1611,Cabal Orders,Bring the Cabal Orders to Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes. ,"This message bears a dark seal and though the language seems somewhat familiar, it appears to be encoded. Perhaps someone at the Refugee Caravan will know something about it. "
1612,Stymying the Arakkoa,"Kill Ashkaz in Veil Reskk, Ayit in Veil Shienor, and Urdak in Veil Skith and return to Thander at the Allerian Stronghold. ","We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers. My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out Ashkaz, Ayit, and Urdak, in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them. "
1613,Veil Rhaze: Unliving Evil,"Kill 4 Deathtalon Spirits, 4 Screeching Spirits and 2 Spirit Ravens and return to Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan. ","Veil Rhaze was a particularly wicked colony of Skettis. Despite the village's eradication by the Auchindoun disaster, Terokk's influence remained in the maligned spirits there. Travel west to Veil Rhaze and slay those murderous wretches. You'll find them to the west of the Shadow Tomb, on the border of Bone Wastes and Terokkar Forest. This will be our first blow against Terokk and the guardians of Skettis. "
1614,Surrender to the Horde,Rokag wants you to seek out Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City and demand that he and his people surrender to the Horde. ,"The cowardly arakkoa attack us daily.  They ambush our hunters and sometimes even raid inside our walls.  We kill them when we can, but their magic is strong and they often escape our warbands. I have learned that some arakkoa claim to be friendly with the Horde.  They live in Shattrath City to the northwest. Rilak the Redeemed is their leader.  Search for him in the Lower City, and when you find him, demand his surrender. "
1615,What Are These Things? ,Deliver the Box of Parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. ,"I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are.  I do know one thing though - they look dangerous! <name>, I think you should take this box of parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold to the southeast.  She may have some idea of what these are. "
1616,Escape from Firewing Point! ,Escort Isla Starmane to safety and then report to Captain Auric Sunchaser at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. ,"Thank goodness for you! <class>, I need you to help me escape.  I have information vital to the security of the Allerian Stronghold and probably all of Outland! I came here from the Cenarion Expedition on a diplomatic mission, but as you can see, they weren't very friendly.  If you help me get to safety, I can assure you that you will be handsomely rewarded! We won't be able to do this on our own - you do have a group with you, right? "
1617,An Unseen Hand,Bring the Fel Orc Plans to Rokag at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ,"The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point. Why would the two forces be working together? Rokag might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to Stonebreaker Hold and show him the map. "
1618,Helping the Lost Find Their Way,"Destroy 10 Lost Spirits and 10 Broken Skeletons, and then speak with Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest. ","Many spirits of the draenei were corrupted by the explosion of Auchindoun.  Now they wander the wastes in torment. <name>, I beseech you to put them to rest.  Destroy the lost spirits and broken skeletons that haunt the Bone Wastes beyond Auchindoun's walls. What?  You think leaving them to wander in blind agony would be better? Afterward, return to Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan and tell him of that which you have done. "
1619,Speak with Scout Neftis,Speak with Scout Neftis near the south entrance to Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest. ,"I am informed that one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village is currently observing a shadowy band that has recently moved in there. <name>, I want you to speak with Scout Neftis and see how you can assist her in figuring out what this unknown group is up to. Just head south out of here, and then due west, skirting the north of the Bone Wastes.  Her last report puts her position near the southern entrance to the village. "
1620,Seek Out Kirrik,Take Rilak's Missive to Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes. ,"Other arakkoa took part in the betrayal of Terokk. Kirrik recognized Terokk as a charlatan, not a prophet. The only prophecy Terokk envisioned was the doom borne of his own bidding. It was Kirrik who led us bravely from Skettis. After our pilgrimage to Shattrath, Kirrik traveled to the colonies in search of others. This missive tells of what the Eyes have seen. Kirrik must be told! Follow the road south out of Shattrath to the Bone Wastes and look for the caravan. "
1621,Patriarch Ironjaw,Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold. ,"You've done well in gathering the first pelts. The final piece of the vestments requires a pelt unlike any other. There is one particular wolf, an old and cunning one, that has earned his place as the patriarch of the forest wolves. He is known among them as Ironjaw, the mighty hunter. In my visions, I have seen him wandering the northeastern region of the forest. Including his pelt in the vestments will surely light the wolf spirit's path. Do not mourn Ironjaw. He will be well honored. "
1622,Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know,Speak with Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest. ,"<name>, after you're done celebrating here, I think that you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren. I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there. "
1623,The Fallen Exarch,Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to destroy the contents of the Auchenai Coffin. ,"They are feeding the souls they steal to a coffin that they have dragged out from the Auchenai Crypts. My scouts believe the contents of the coffin to contain the first exarch of the crypts. They seek to resurrect the ancient one! You must battle your way to the western side of Auchindoun and disturb the contents of that coffin before they feed it enough souls. Should you lose your way, follow the walking souls. Destroy whatever is inside that coffin! "
1624,Thinning the Ranks,Kill 10 Bonechewer Devastators and 6 Bonechewer Backbreakers and return to Theloria Shadecloak. ,"Knowing Thander and Bertelm, they won't tolerate such a large buildup of hostile forces on our doorstep. Asking them to dispatch members of the garrison to participate in an attack on the camp isn't an option either. It would just leave us too vulnerable to attack. It falls to us to do what we can to diminish the threat the fel orc buildup poses. Kill what you can of their forces and I will look for ways to stall any reinforcements. "
1625,Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know,Speak with Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest. ,"<name>, I think that after you're done celebrating here, you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren. I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there. "
1626,Digging Through Bones,Escort Letoll and his crew and protect them while they make their dig. ,"Oy! You look like you can take care of yerself, <race>. Me and the crew here are looking for a bodyguard to watch over us while we hit a dig site to the north. The pay is pretty good and all you gotta do is make sure no nasty creatures kill me or any of my employees. If you successfully make it back without any casualties, Dwarfowitz over there will pay ya. "
1627,Success! ,Take the information that you beat out of Unkor back to Kilrath in Terokkar Forest. ,"For many years, Boulderfist ruled all ogres in the Outland. The ogres were united under Krol and content with the lands that they were given. In the past few months, we have lost many ogres to a new clan known as Warmaul. Warmaul has taken most of our land in Nagrand and killed many of our people. We had no choice but to take this town. We are being exterminated. . . Krol has gone missing and Boulderfist is in turmoil. Lantresor of the Blade rules in his absence. "
1628,A Dandy's Best Friend,Bring 30 Arakkoa Feathers to Ros'eleth in the Allerian Stronghold. ,"Don't let Thander and company fool you. They may look like a band of fearsome warriors, but underneath all that steel, they're nothing more than a troop of dandies! And they won't be seen in public without their hats. They're extravagant affairs made from felt and fur, complete with the gaudiest feathers you've ever seen. The most desirable feathers come from any of the arakkoa, of course, and my supply is running low. I'll gladly pay you if you'll collect them for me. "
1629,For the Fallen,Vindicator Haylen wants you to slay 20 Dreadfang Widows and then return to him just west of Netherweb Ridge. ,"When the dreadfang widows attacked our outpost we heard the voice of the naaru calling us to battle.  We pursued the creatures into the night.  Some of our people we found dead in the dark, others we could hear struggling against their captors. By morning we had come to this place and we fought a fierce battle but we were beaten.  Dreadfang poison will soon take my companions and I cannot last long.  Before I die I must know that the dreadfang widows were beaten. "
1630,Return to Sha'tari Base Camp,Vindicator Haylen wants you to return to the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes and speak with Scout Navrin. ,We will not make it back on our own.  The dreadfang poison is too strong. You must return to Sha'tari Base Camp for us. Scout Navrin will send a rescue party out to find us. 
1631,Before Darkness Falls,"Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan wants you to kill 8 Cabal Skirmishers, 4 Cabal Spell-Weavers and 2 Cabal Initiates. ","After our caravan fell prey to an attack by Shadow Council cabal cultists, scouts were sent to Shattrath to call for help.  The guards think we're safe for now, but they underestimate these madmen. I, for one, am not looking forward to having my throat slit by some cabal initiate in the middle of the night.  Do us all a favor and take the fight to them, before they come to us. You will find our attackers south of here, at Auchindoun's northern entrance. "
1632,Missing Friends,Ethan wants you to find 12 of his missing friends in Veil Skith and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan. ,We broke down here because some guys came in the night and made a lot of noise.  It was scary.  I don't know when we are going to get moving again. Some of my friends are missing though.  I don't know where they are.  I think those scary bird men took them away to the northwest.  They probably are all locked up in cages and stuff.  If you find them that would be great.  I'm kind of worried about them. 
1633,Stymying the Arakkoa,"Kill Ashkaz in Veil Reskk, Ayit in Veil Shienor, and Urdak in Veil Skith and return to Rokag at Stonebreaker Hold. ","We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers. My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out Ashkaz, Ayit, and Urdak, in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them. "
1634,Fel Orc Plans,Bring the Fel Orc Plans to Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. ,"The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point. Why would the two forces be working together? Bertelm might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to the Allerian Stronghold and show him the map. "
1635,Unruly Neighbors,Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to Theloria Shadecloak at the Allerian Post. ,"The recent arrival of the fel orcs at the ruins to the east both puzzles and troubles Thander. They wasted no time in starting to construct fortifications and repair the buildings. The construction goes on day and night, <name>. I've dispatched one of my most reliable agents to keep watch, but we can ill afford to delay action. Move against their workers, then seek out Theloria Shadecloak at the Allerian Post to the north of the Bonechewer Ruins. She'll give you further instructions. "
1636,Vestments of the Wolf Spirit,Bring 12 Timber Worg Pelts to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold. ,"Generations ago, when orc clans still called Terokkar Forest home, the wolf spirit played an important role in their lives. When the orcs departed, they had no longer had any need for the spirit and they left it behind. In time, the spirit grew lonely and it too left the forest. I believe I can bring the wolf spirit back to his ancestral home, just as we orcs have returned. The ritual will require me to create vestments from the pelts of the wolves of the forest to guide the spirit back to its home. "
1637,Kill the Shadow Council! ,"Kill 10 Shadowy Executioners, 10 Shadowy Summoners and Shadowmaster Grieve, and then return to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ","What!  Those guys are Shadow Council? ! <name>, you have to go back in there and waste them!  I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can. After you're done with that, report back to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold. Good luck, <class>! "
1638,Attack on Firewing Point,"Kill 10 Firewing Defenders, 10 Firewing Bloodwarders, and 10 Firewing Warlocks. ","We know that the blood elves of Firewing Point are working for Kael'thas and Illidan.  And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the Broken of Tuurem as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon. Whatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers. The Firewing blood elves need to be taken out!  Head up to Firewing Point to the north and see to it. "
1639,Recover the Bones,Collect 10 Restless Bones. ,"The bones of the dead draenei litter the Bone Wastes from the explosion of Auchindoun.  Their spirits are restless, and cannot move on to the next life. <class>, you must help me to recover their bones and take them to their final resting place!  Only then will they be at peace; only then will they know comfort. Gather up the restless bones with care and deliver them to Ramdor the Mad at Auchindoun in the center of the Bone Wastes.  Despite his name, he will know how to care for them. "
1640,What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket? ,Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest. ,"<class>, I have urgent business for you.  We haven't heard from the druids of the Cenarion Thicket in quite some time.  This is unusual as we usually hear from them at least once every few days. I want you to go up there and make sure that they're alright.  You can find the thicket by heading northwest through the forest. "
1641,What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket? ,Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest. ,"Hey there, <class>.  We haven't heard from the druids of the Cenarion Thicket in quite some time. I want you to go over there and check to see what's happening.  You can find it by heading northwest through the forest. "
1642,Wanted: Bonelashers Dead! ,Kill 20 Bonelashers and then report to Mawg Grimshot at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ,"The bonelashers of the Bone Wastes bit Mawg and made him sick.  Now he wants all of them destroyed! While they can be found throughout the wastes, they are known to congregate at Carrion Hill in the north. Return to Mawg Grimshot after you've done the deed and he'll give you a good reward. "
1643,Secrets of the Arakkoa,Lady Dena Kennedy wants you to seek out Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City and find out what secrets he will share of the Arakkoa. ,"Out here on the frontier we have to deal with the arakkoa every day.  They strike at us when they please, raiding our supply lines and killing our scouts. Yet we know very little about these enigmatic creatures.  I have received news that northwest of here in Shattrath City there are arakkoa who are not hostile.  They might be willing to share the secrets of their race. Rilak the Redeemed is their leader.  He resides in the northern part of the Lower City. "
1644,The Infested Protectors,Lakotae wants you to kill 25 Wood Mites and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan. ,The trees of this land are ravaged by the power that was unleashed from Auchindoun.  The foul magic that was unleashed blasted the land into the wastes you see all around.  The trees that survived are now infested with wretched wood mites that crawl under their bark and gnaw at their flesh. Rotting forest-rages and infested root-walkers are breeding grounds for the mites.  They are found along the edge of the wood to the east.  Destroy these creatures and then kill the mites that flee their husks. 
1645,An Unwelcome Presence,Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to Shadowstalker Kaide. ,"Our forces at Thrallmar thought they had the fel orcs contained in the Hellfire Citadel area, but the recent arrivals at the ruins to the east say otherwise. We can't permit them to gain a foothold here. Rokag has dispatched Shadowstalker Kaide to the ruins to keep an eye on them, but we have to do something to keep them from digging in. Go to the ruins, decimate their peons, and then look for Kaide in the trees to the north. He'll tell you where to go from there. "
1646,An Improper Burial,Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to burn 8 Slain Auchenai Warriors and 8 Slain Sha'tar Vindicators. ,"Is there nothing that can be done to stem the tide of corruption? My soldiers have been battling the Auchenai for days now with no end in sight. Each casualty, whether Auchenai or Sha'tar, is snatched from the battlefield - their souls lifted and taken to parts unknown. I will not have it! A proper burial is out of the question but those fiends will not have their souls! Take this torch and travel to the field of battle, directly east of here. Burn every corpse you see! We will not fuel their rituals. "
1647,Alien Spirits,Bring 30 Arakkoa Feathers to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold. ,"When I first came to Outland, and opened my ears to the voices of its spirits, I was amazed at what I heard. In time, I also came to notice which spirits I couldn't hear. For all my attempts, I have never been able to make contact with the spirit of an arakkoa ancestor. Their magic is fundamentally different from ours, but I'm not convinced that their spirits are beyond my reach. Bring me feathers from many arakkoa; perhaps having some token from them will provide the link I need. "
1648,The Firewing Point Project,Steal the four Mana Bomb Code Sheets and deliver them to Lieutenant Meridian at the Allerian Post in Terokkar Forest. ,"As I was saying, we've just received some further intel and there's a much larger problem at hand. The blood elves are hard at work on the construction of a second bomb at Firewing Point.  I cannot stress strongly enough the implications of them completing and using such a device on the Allerian Stronghold! My scouts tell me that they are guarding the codes to the device in the four smaller buildings ringing the central courtyard.  Get in there and retrieve those codes before it's too late! "
1649,Host of the Hidden City,Take Luanga's Orders to Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. ,"Although you cannot read the strange script on the scroll, the ornate seal at the bottom of the document implies that it was drafted by an arakkoa of high standing. Luanga may have masterminded the capture and interrogation of Deirom, but it seems he was taking orders from someone else. You remember Thander mentioning that Andarl has studied the arakkoa. Perhaps he can decipher the scroll's contents. "
1650,Olemba Seed Oil,Bring 30 Olemba Seeds to Rakoria in Stonebreaker Hold. ,"The oily seeds from the forest's olemba trees could prove very valuable. I'd like to gather a larger quantity of them, press them for their oil, and then see what I can do with it. Just think, there's a whole forest full of trees out there, producing a lot of seeds that go to waste. I don't care if it turns out to be cooking oil, lamp oil, or weapon oil, I won't let it go to waste! Bring me any of the seeds that you happen to gather from the olemba cones. They're all over the place. "
1651,The Firewing Liaison,"Locate and slay Lisaile Fireweaver, then return to Shadowstalker Kaide. ","Over the past couple of days, I've observed a blood elf woman traveling to and from the fel orc stronghold and conversing with the fel orc leader. From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying? My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point. I stopped before reaching the perimeter of the blood elf outpost. Kill her before she leaves the fel orc camp again. "
1652,Report to Stonebreaker Camp,Tooki wants you to report to Sergeant Chawni at Stonebreaker Camp in Terokkar Forest. ,"This calls for immediate action! We have someone out in the field closer to Firewing Point that I want you to speak with.  She'll have a better idea of what our next step should be. Report to Sergeant Chawni out at Stonebreaker Camp and apprise her of the situation. Take the road north out of the hold.  From the middle of Tuurem, follow the road to the east.  You'll find the camp on the bank of the river that lies just southwest of Firewing Point. Good luck, <name>. "
1653,Timber Worg Tails,Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold wants you to bring him 12 Timber Worg Tails. ,"Have you come across the timber worgs in your travels? I've had the opportunity to observe them while mapping some of the northern reaches of the forest. I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat. They have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory. It's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help? "
1654,A Hero Is Needed,Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to slay 12 Auchenai Initiates and 5 Auchenai Doomsayers. ,It is not enough. A hero is needed. Our forces are overwhelmed as the Auchenai continue to grow in number. < Commander Ra'vaj looks at you. >Will you be the hero? Return to the field of battle and strike at their soldiers. Keep them occupied so that my scouts can get behind their lines and see what they are creating. 
1655,The Firewing Point Project,Steal the four Mana Bomb Code Sheets and deliver them to Sergeant Chawni at Stonebreaker Camp in Terokkar Forest. ,"As I was saying, we've just received some further intel and there's a much larger problem at hand. The blood elves are hard at work on the construction of a second bomb at Firewing Point.  I cannot stress strongly enough the implications of them completing and using such a device on Stonebreaker Hold! My scouts tell me that they are guarding the codes to the device in the four smaller buildings ringing the central courtyard.  Get in there and retrieve those codes before it's too late! "
1656,Taken in the Night,Scout Navrin wants you to travel to the Netherweb Ridge and free 6 Webbed Sha'tar Warriors and then return to him at Sha'tari Base Camp. ,"Our small outpost is under constant attack. Several nights ago, we were raided by the spiders of Netherweb Ridge, on the southeastern edge of the Bone Wastes. They poisoned many of our people, wrapped them in webs and carried them away. Some of our warriors took up arms and with little preparation pursued the spiders. We have not seen the captives or our hunting parties since. We hope that some may still be alive, perhaps imprisoned by the spiders.  Our numbers are few. Will you search for our people? "
1657,Host of the Hidden City,Bring Luanga's Orders to Kurgatok at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ,"Although you cannot read the strange script on the scroll, the ornate seal at the bottom of the document implies that it was drafted by an arakkoa of high standing. Luanga may have masterminded the capture and interrogation of Dugar, but it seems he was taking orders from someone else. You remember Rokag mentioning that Kurgatok has studied the arakkoa. Perhaps he can decipher the scroll's contents. "
1658,Artifacts from Tuurem,Gather 6 Tuurem Artifacts from Tuurem Scavengers and Tuurem Hunters and bring them to Rakoria at Stonebreaker Hold. ,"Have you ever noticed the behavior of the Lost Ones in Tuurem? They wander the ruins, searching for surviving scraps of anything made by the draenei. Their Broken masters know better. They've left their former lives and identities behind and become something completely different. I believe we can use the Lost Ones' compulsion to our benefit and gather old draenei relics from them. Why risk life and limb battling the Broken, when we can profit from picking our targets wisely? "
1659,Arakkoa War Path,Advisor Faila asks that you kill 14 Shienor Talonites and 6 Shienor Sorcerers and then return to her in Stonebreaker Hold. ,"The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could charge out to meet them in numbers.  They use their summoning circles to rescue their warriors from certain death but they cannot run from us if we attack their homes.  Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northeast. Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can. "
1660,Speak with Private Weeks,Speak with Private Weeks near the north entrance to Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest. ,"A report's just come in from one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village.  He says that a shadowy band has moved into the ruins there. <name>, I want you to speak with Private Weeks and see how you can assist him to figure out what this unknown group is up to.  Just head west past Stonebreaker Hold.  His last report puts his position near the north entrance to the village. "
1661,Kill the Shadow Council! ,"Kill 10 Shadowy Executioners, 10 Shadowy Summoners and Shadowmaster Grieve, and then return to Lieutenant Gravelhammer at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. ","What!  Those guys are Shadow Council? ! <name>, you have to go back in there and waste them!  I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can. After you're done with that, report back to Lieutenant Gravelhammer at the Allerian Stronghold. Good luck, <class>! "
1662,"And Now, the Moment of Truth",Find Grek and ask him to try it on his weapon. ,"The oil is finally ready for its first test. It seems heavy enough to serve as a high quality weapon oil. The only way to find out is to have a professional try it out. See Grek over there by the wanted posters? Sure, he's no poet, but the orc knows his way around a weapon! Take a sample of the oil to him and ask him to use it on his weapon. After he's had a chance to test it out, let me know what he thinks of it. "
1663,The Spirits Are Calling,"Anchorite Lyteera wants you to locate her assistant, Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest. ","The spirits of the dead in the Bone Wastes have been calling out to me and they are in pain! <class>, you must journey to the Bone Wastes to the south and find my assistant, Soolaveen with the Refugee Caravan.  He must be feeling it too, and will need your assistance to help put the spirits there to rest. If you hurry, you may catch them.  I know that they were going to stop for a while in the northern portion of the Bone Wastes before continuing south to Auchindoun. "
1664,To Shattrath City,Use the scroll of teleportation from your inventory to reach Shattrath City and speak to the mysterious Haggard War Veteran. ,"A mysterious message has come for you to travel to a land beyond Azeroth. 

Heed the call and investigate what lies in these new lands. "
1665,Drain Schematics,Drain Schematics is a quest with objectives in Zangarmarsh. ,"The schematics you've obtained show an underground system of drains and pumps that connect the lakes in the region to Serpent Lake. If the schematics are correct, there is a giant drain in the center of Serpent Lake.  Confirm this and bring the news to Cenarion Refuge. "
1666,"A Damp, Dark Place",Look for Ikeyen's Belongings inside a cave south of Umbrafen. ,"Soon after I escaped the Umbrafen tribe, I holed up in a cave south of their village.  Little did I know that the cave was being fought over by marsh beasts and spore men! I had to leave in a hurry and left behind a box containing my only worldly possessions. After managing to sneak out of Umbrafen with my belongings it was terrible irony that I would lose them so soon after.  If you're willing to bring them back to me I'll give you one of my very own personal items.  What do you say, <name>? "
1667,Escape from Umbrafen,Escort Kayra Longmane to the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"You must help me get out of here! I was gathering herbs nearby when a handful of these little savages abducted me.  I tried to fight them off, but there were too many of them. Help me return to the Cenarion Refuge and away from these cruel wretches and their vile magic! "
1668,Saving the Sporeloks,"Slay 10 Marsh Dredgers and 10 Marsh Lurkers, and then return to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ","Ikeyen's been telling me stories about what happened to him down in those caves and I think it's just awful! You know, maybe we should do something to help out those poor sporeloks.  Ikeyen says that they live there in the Funggor Cavern, but that the marsh beasts have recently invaded. Why don't you go down there and see if you can clear some of those marsh beasts out?  It's just to the southwest. "
1669,The Umbrafen Tribe,"Ikeyen at the Cenarion Refuge wants you to travel to Umbrafen Village and slay Kataru, 8 Umbrafen Seers, 6 Umbrafen Witchdoctors and 6 Umbrafen Oracles. ","The naga are terrible, yes.  But even more terrible are the traitor tribes of Broken and Lost Ones that helped them! The worst of all are the Lost Ones of the Umbrafen tribe; they use dark magic to trap and enslave others. They're especially cruel to escaped slaves and would slit my throat if I left the refuge even for a day. Travel to Umbrafen Village south of here and kill them and their leader, Kataru.  Until then I will fear for my life every single day. "
1670,Now That We're Friends. . . ,"Kill 12 Bloodscale Slavedrivers and 6 Bloodscale Enchantresses, and then return to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh. ","The naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast have begun to kill our people.  We cannot allow this to continue, <class>! We suggest that you teach them a lesson as proof of our friendship. "
1671,Fertile Spores,Gshaff wants you to gather 6 Fertile Spores from the various Zangarmarsh Spore Bats and Marsh Walkers. ,"Spore bats and marsh walkers accumulate fertile spores on their appendages from wandering around the tallstalk mushrooms in the marsh. As you can see, we're a short people so our options for gathering these spores are limited.  Seek out the spore bats and marsh walkers and gather the fertile spores.  All of Sporeggar will be in your debt. "
1672,Messenger to the Feralfen,Drink Ahuurn's Elixir while standing in the Boha'mu Ruins. ,"The time has come for us to embrace the Feralfen and teach them that the Light has not forsaken them. Take the potion I've prepared and carry it with you to the Boha'mu Ruins. Once you arrive at the ruins, drink the potion to assume the form of one of their bird spirits. Speak with Elder Kuruti and let him know the draenei are ready to welcome his people as our long lost brothers. "
1673,Glowcap Mushrooms,Bring 10 Glowcaps to Msshi'fn at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh. ,"I've seen your kind use shiny round pieces of metal to trade for things that you need.  We're not so different from you.  We use shiny round mushrooms as our currency. Glowcap mushrooms grow everywhere in the marsh, you just have to know how to pick them from the ground without wrecking them.  I'll teach you how to do it, if you promise to bring us some for our reserves.  What do you say, <name>? "
1674,As the Crow Flies,Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Stormcrow Amulet to explore the major lakes in Zangarmarsh. ,"We must determine how widespread the naga's activity truly is and react accordingly. Exploring each body of water in Zangarmarsh could be a lengthy undertaking.  If you allow me to, I will use my magic to mold your shape to one more suited to scouting the marsh. Hold this amulet above the balcony near me when you're ready to begin.  I will guide your way back to safety after we're done. "
1675,Watcher Leesa'oh,Speak with Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh. ,"There's important research to be conducted into the ecology of the local creatures, especially the sporelings and bog lords of the marsh.  And trust me, once you get out into the field, you'll find the work to be challenging. Seek out Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in the western region of the marsh toward the south.  Follow the path west and you will eventually find her.  She can be a bit -- studious -- but don't let that get to you. Oh, and watch out for her cat. "
1676,Stealing Back the Mushrooms,Collect 10 Boxes of Mushrooms and return them to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh. ,"<class>, I've got an idea.   I want you to head north again, this time into the heart of ogre territory! Northwest of the Hewn Bog there is a place named Ango'rosh Stronghold, which sits on a floating island across a large mushroom bridge. The ogres must be storing the harvested mushrooms there.  I bet you'll find them all over the place, and probably on the ogres themselves, too! Bring me a sufficient number and I will try to do something about providing the bog lords with a new source of nourishment. "
1677,Ango'rosh Encroachment,Kill 10 Ango'rosh Ogres and 5 Ango'rosh Shaman and return to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage. ,"The small band of Broken you see here is a mission from a larger settlement in Nagrand. The Kurenai, as we call ourselves, are Broken who desire to reunite with our draenei brothers. My group has come here to strengthen Kurenai ties to the draenei of Telredor. If the Ango'rosh ogres have their way, this temple will not stand much longer. They have cleared the Hewn Bog of its towering mushrooms and draw ever closer to our refuge. If you would call yourself our friend, aid us in fighting this enemy. "
1678,The Dying Balance,"Locate and deal with Boglash, then return to Lethyn Moonfire at Cenarion Refuge. ","Have you observed your surroundings closely, <name>? This is an ailing landscape, struggling to keep itself in balance and losing the fight. If you know where to look, you can see the symptoms. Members of some species rapidly outgrow their peers and become more aggressive. A good example of this uncontrolled growth is the marshtrekker Boglash. If you wish to see it for yourself, look no further than the waterways south of the refuge. Be prepared to defend yourself. The creature knows no mercy. "
1679,More Spore Sacs,"Have you rescued any more spore sacs, &lt; race&gt; ? A level 63 Zangarmarsh Quest. ",Yes!  You've saved more spore sacs. You're different than the other outsiders.  I'll let my people know about your deeds! <This quest is repeatable up to friendly reputation. >
1680,More Tendrils! ,"You killed many giants, but there are still many more left. ",Unbelievable!  It would take hundreds of sporelings to slay as many giants as you have.  I will make sure to let everyone know of your feats! <This quest is repeatable up to friendly reputation. >
1681,The Boha'mu Ruins,Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor wants you to explore the Boha'mu Ruins. ,"Before my people were decimated by the orcs, Telredor served as a retreat for draenei anchorites and spiritualists. A small order of anchorites and vindicators maintained a number of shrines in this region. During the war, we lost contact with the anchorites assigned to the shrines, particularly the Boha'mu temple to the southwest. I've heard reports that a tribe of Lost Ones has settled in the area and may even be using the ruins. Visit the Boha'mu Ruins and tell me of what you find there. "
1682,Daggerfen Deviance,Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers. ,"The Kurenai and the draenei don't always see eye to eye, particularly on the issue of the Lost Ones. We are content to help the Lost Ones who seek us out, but we won't pursue them. Some draenei are intent on 'redeeming' them all. However, there are times when even the Lost Ones go too far, such as the Daggerfen. In their village to the west, they dabble in poisons and deceit, arts that come unnaturally to us. We must put an end to this before the vile Daggerfen can extend their influence. "
1683,Familiar Fungi,Collect 15 Mushroom Samples and return them to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh. ,"Yes, that's it, I knew I had seen this particular phylum of mushroom elsewhere in the marsh! To the north is a place known as the Hewn Bog.  Odd name for the place if you ask me, but I've never been there.  I'll need samples of those mushrooms to confirm my hypothesis. Just be careful, <class>.  I'd heard that ogres have moved in to the area, so you'll have to get the samples from them.  Could that be why the bog lords are no longer going there for their food? "
1684,Balance Must Be Preserved,"Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Ironvine Seeds on the Steam Pump Controls at Serpent Lake, Umbrafen Lake, Marshlight Lake and the Lagoon. ","I cannot begin to comprehend why the naga would drain the water out of their own habitat.  What I do understand is a need to put a stop to their operations. These seeds carry with them the rage of the earth.  Take them to the steam pumps operated by the naga and use them on their controls. The vines that grow from the seeds will be as thick as your arm and as strong as iron.  Go, <name>.  Restore the balance that the naga have upset. "
1685,A Spirit Ally? ,Take the Feralfen Totem to the foot of the stairs at the Boha'mu Ruins and plant it in the ground. ,We must find out how much power this Feralfen snake spirit possesses and whether it can be bent to our will. Imagine what I could do with the powers of an Outland spirit at my command! Take this totem with you and make your way to the foot of the stairs leading to the Boha'mu Ruins. Plant the totem in the ground and it should do the rest. The spirit should not be able to tell who has used the totem until it has manifested. 
1686,Leader of the Bloodscale,Slay Rajis Fyashe at Serpent Lake and return to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh for a reward. ,"A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajis Fyashe, leader of the Bloodscale naga.  The naga sorceress was last sighted at Serpent Lake, in the northern region of Zangarmarsh. The Bloodscale are to be considered extremely dangerous and their leader is to be approached with extreme caution. Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot at Cenarion Refuge. "
1687,The Terror of Marshlight Lake,Slay Terrorclaw and return to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage. ,"Traveling through naga-infested lands has shown me the cruel truth about how my less fortunate brethren are treated. At Marshlight Lake, to the southwest, I observed a particularly malicious taskmaster playing a deadly game. He orders his slaves out to the islands in Marshlight Lake when he knows that Terrorclaw, a giant bogstrok, is ready to feed. I needn't describe what results. We are too few to take on the naga directly, but we can deprive them of their amusement by killing their pet. "
1688,Now That We're Still Friends. . . ,"Kill 12 Bloodscale Slavedrivers and 6 Bloodscale Enchantresses, and then return to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh. ","Reports have come in that the naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast continue to kill our people.  We thought that you had dealt with this, <class>! I suggest that you to teach them a lesson as proof of our continued friendship. "
1689,Have You Ever Seen One of These? ,Take the Murloc Cage and place it on the flat rock near Daggerfen Village. ,"This marsh be missin' one thing, mon! There be no murlocs here. Don't worry, mon, I got a plan to fix the problem. See Gargle 'n' Gurgle over there? I plan to give the gift o' murlocs to the Lost Ones! Take this cage with you to Daggerfen Village an' release 'em in the northeastern cluster of huts. Now you know I can't be riskin' Gargle 'n' Gurgle with you, but I'll give you a cage full o' colorful young murlocs. Just set it on the flat rock you be findin' up there and open the door! "
1690,Pursuing Terrorclaw,Kill Terrorclaw and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin. ,"I've caught every kind of fish that lives in the marsh, but there's one that eludes me. Sure, I've caught eels and mudfin frenzies. But the last time I was out on one of the islands in Marshlight Lake, I hooked a gigantic bogstrok that snapped my line and got away. Terrorclaw, he's called, and I won't rest until he's dead. He's too big for any fisherman to catch, so I suppose we'll just have to kill him the old-fashioned way. "
1691,Withered Flesh,Gather 5 Parched Hydra Samples and 5 Withered Bog Lord Samples and bring them to Ruam at Telredor. ,"We must determine how far the damage has spread. The basidium you brought me comes from a bog giant. Their larger, hardier cousins, the bog lords, should prove more resistant to the degeneration that's struck the giants. It would be good to know how the changes in the Dead Mire have affected the other creatures out there, too. Return to the Dead Mire and see if you can get samples from the bog lords and the hydra in the area. "
1692,Natural Enemies,Fahssn at the Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh wants you to bring him 6 Bog Lord Tendrils. ,"Us sporelings and the bog lords have never gotten along well.  In the past, we've managed to keep them at bay with spears and stones.  Lately they seem to have become more aggressive. . . or more desperate.  They do not fear us or our weapons. You are much scarier and better armed than us.  If you were to fight the boglords for us, we'd be forever in your debt!  Bring me their tendrils so I know how many you've killed. "
1693,Identify Plant Parts,I could still use some more plant parts. ,Excellent.  Keep bringing me more plant parts if you find any. <This quest is repeatable up to Honored reputation. >
1694,Natural Armor,Bring 8 Fenclaw Hides to Maktu at the Orebor Harborage. ,"Maktu can always see a draenei approaching in his shiny armor from a mile away, even in this murky swamp! Maktu wants to laugh at them, but then he remembers that they have been kind to the Kurenai and he wants to teach them about how Kurenai make armor. The dark, scaly hides of the fenclaw thrashers make some of the best armor Maktu has ever worn. If <name> can bring Maktu some of these hides from the fenclaw thrashers deep in Serpent Lake, he'll be happy to share some of his armor. "
1695,Blacksting's Bane,Bring Blacksting's Stinger to Prospector Conall at Telredor. ,"By Khaz'goroth's flaming navel, it's hot here! I can't blame the first party for leaving, but everyone knows 'twasn't the heat that drove them away. No, it was Blacksting, although they won't admit it. They were camped just to the south of the glowing draenei towers to the west, just north of the Feralfen Village, when the giant wasp appears out of nowhere and attacks! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when I bring the creature's stinger back to Ironforge and show it to them! "
1696,Fhwoor Smash! ,Escort Fhwoor into the area of the Marshlight steam pump to retrieve the Ark of Ssslith. ,"Little naga make Fhwoor angry!  Sporelings good friend to Fhwoor, so Fhwoor get naga ark. We go into nearby naga village.  You help?  Bring friends! "
1697,The Respect of Another,Bring Blacksting's Stinger to Reavij at Swamprat Post. ,"Magasha is the fiercest troll in the Marsh, but she only respects mighty hunters. 

I tried to prove myself to her, but the one beast that could impress her is beyond my skill. Maybe you could help me out? It's the giant bog wasp known as Blacksting that roams the area south of the glowing draenei towers to the west. If you bring me its stinger maybe she'll give me a chance to join her hunters.

I know it's a little sneaky, but I promise to learn under her and do ya both proud. "
1698,Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki,Bring Chieftain Mummaki's Totem to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage. ,"Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki - leader of the foul and degenerate Lost One tribe of the Daggerfen, for his brutal attacks against the Orebor Harborage. The chieftain and his band of assassins are responsible for the deaths of numerous Kurenai and draenei and should only be approached by seasoned combatants. Travelers are advised to avoid the Daggerfen Village area to the west of the Orebor Harborage. To claim the bounty, present proof of the chietain's demise to Ikuti. "
1699,No More Mushrooms! ,Gather 8 Eel Filets from Umbrafen Eels and bring them to Magasha at Swamprat Post. ,"Mushroom soup, mushroom stew, mushroom sauce! Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom! It's all there is to eat around here. If you say you're hungry, the cook hands you an axe and tells you to go chop down your dinner! Well, I'm tired of mushrooms. I've seen fish in the lakes around here. Sure, they look like a nasty piece of work, but they've got to be better than mushrooms! How much will it cost me to hire you to bring me my first decent meal in weeks? "
1700,A Job Undone,Magasha at Swamprat Post wants you to kill Sporewing. ,"Someone needs to find a way to make Reavij come to his senses! He's ignoring his duty and instead, he's devoting all his energy to getting my attention. I've tried ignoring him and telling him to stop. Nothing seems to work. Until he gets over this, I'm left cleaning up after him. He was supposed to have dealt with Sporewing, but I'll bet the monster is alive and well. If you have time, would you mind going to the western part of the Dead Mire and killing the bat? I'll deal with Reavij in the meantime. "
1701,News for Rakoria,Speak with Rakoria at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ,"Now that Swamprat Post is complete, our control of the roads in and out of the marsh is much less tenuous. Our presence in Terokkar Forest is much less secure. Even so, at Stonebreaker Hold, Rakoria awaits word of our progress. She's sharp and capable, <name>, but be careful around her. She's got a lot of goods she's eager to move along the roads, but don't assume she's got our best interests at heart. Rakoria goes where she believes there's profit to be found. "
1702,Plants of Zangarmarsh,Bring 10 Unidentified Plant Parts to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water.  We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct. As the expedition's cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them. If you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts.  They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them. "
1703,Warden Hamoot,Report to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"Before you leave Cenarion Refuge, make sure you speak with Warden Hamoot.  He's in charge of the expedition's security. He would never forgive me if I didn't send a seasoned adventurer like you his way. "
1704,Gathering the Reagents,Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor wants you to bring him 4 Sporebat Eyes and 4 Fen Strider Tentacles. ,"I have a feeling that these Lost Ones may not respond well to a draenei, but would welcome an arakkoa. I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time. It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered. You will need to bring me a handful of sporebat eyes and some fen strider tentacles. Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor. "
1705,Overlord Gorefist,Ikuti wants you to kill Overlord Gorefist and 10 Ango'rosh Maulers. ,"The centerpiece of any ogre tribe is its leader. Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next. Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom. Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite. "
1706,Spirits of the Feralfen,Bring 10 Feralfen Protection Totems to Seer Janidi at Zabra'jin. ,"The most powerful tribe of Lost Ones in the marsh, the Feralfen, are said to possess powerful medicine. There may be no truth to such rumors, but anything that might help me channel the spirits of this world cannot be ignored. Find the Feralfen mystics, hunters and druids, <name>, and capture their totems. Everything I need to know should be apparent from the carvings. "
1707,Sporeggar,"Go to Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh, north of the Spawning Glen, and deliver the Salvaged Spore Sacs to Msshi'fn. ","You're a kind <race>, <name>.  Not like some of the others I've met. You should meet the rest of my people; they'll be very grateful for your help.  Take these spore sacs to my leader, Msshi'fn.  You will find him in Sporeggar, north of here. "
1708,The Cenarion Expedition,Speak to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition.  Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body. The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost.  Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh.  Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there. "
1709,A Warm Welcome,Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge wants you to bring him 30 Naga Claws. ,"While the druids from the expedition have made themselves busy studying plants and researching the lakes, I've made it my business to deal with the hostiles in the area. Ever since we set foot in Zangarmarsh, the naga have launched lethal attacks against us without warning.  We've done our best to keep them at bay, but our resources are limited. I want you to go to the various naga strongholds in Zangarmarsh and show them that we're not to be crossed.  Bring me their claws as proof of your victories. "
1710,Umbrafen Eel Filets,Noraani at Telredor wants you to bring her 8 Eel Filets. ,"It's good to see another fresh face here. When Haalrun and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago. Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor anchorites, but we can follow their example and extend it to others. If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the Umbrafen eel, whose meat is a staple of our diet. "
1711,The Fate of Tuurem,Take Vindicator Idaar's Letter to Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. ,"Prophet Velen's search for allies has emboldened those draenei remaining in Outland to begin a search of their own. The Legion's war on my people drove us from our cities and temples, but they have not destroyed the traces of our civilization. Tuurem, my former home in the Terokkar Forest, was one of the first cities overrun by the orcs. It's been too long since I've received news of its status. Take this letter to Andarl in the Allerian Stronghold within Terokkar and see what you can find out. "
1712,The Sporelings' Plight,Fahssn at the Spawning Glen wants you to collect 10 Mature Spore Sacs. ,"You there!  You must help us! The fungal giants are devouring all of our spore sacs!  You must do something, or we'll lose our young! The spore sacs start out large and become smaller as the air inside them is depleted.  Look for the small, mature spore sacs and save as many of them as you can! "
1713,An Unnatural Drought,Vindicator Idaar at Telredor wants you to kill 12 Withered Giants. ,"The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, <name>. If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the Dead Mire must be suffering terribly. I've seen what happens when the region's fungal giants begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path. These creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering. "
1714,Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake,Investigate the cause of the water depletion at Umbrafen Lake. ,"We came to Outland expecting to find small pockets of life.  What we discovered in Zangarmarsh was a lush environment with a thriving ecosystem. Our initial assessment of the area was deceiving, however.  The water levels at the lakes and marshes have consistently been going down since we started taking measurements. The impact this could have on the local animal and plant life is disastrous.  Go to Umbrafen Lake, southwest of here, and look for clues related to this water depletion. "
1715,Leader of the Darkcrest,Slay Rajah Haghazed at the Lagoon and return to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Expedition in Zangarmarsh for a reward. ,"A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajah Haghazed, leader of the Darkcrest naga.  Haghazed was last sighted by Cenarion scouts at the Lagoon, in the central southern region of Zangarmarsh. The Darkcrest have been linked to numerous attacks against the Cenarion Expedition and their leader is considered extremely dangerous. Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot. "
1716,Warning the Cenarion Circle,Speak to Mahuram Stouthoof at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"The Cenarion Expedition has become a large organization with a good degree of autonomy.  These events are important enough that we need to warn the Cenarion Circle. Do not worry, I will not ask you to travel back to Moonglade; we have emissaries as nearby as Hellfire Peninsula. "
1717,Jyoba's Report,Retrieve Scout Jyoba's Report from the Withered Giants and return it to Zurai at Swamprat Post. ,"Flecks of withered fungus dot the body of Scout Jyoba. Whatever killed him must've been made of the same dying fungus as the giant wilting mushrooms of the Dead Mire. Perhaps one of the withered giants caught him by surprise as he sat writing his report. Without the text of the report, it's nearly impossible to tell what the scout discovered. If the report can be found, it should be returned to Zurai. "
1718,Message to the Daggerfen,Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers and return to Shadow Hunter Denjai at Zabra'jin. ,"Of all the Lost One tribes in Zangarmarsh, the Daggerfen are the most cunning and most aggressive. They are highly organized and make no secret of the fact that they desire control over the other Lost Ones in the marsh. Their attacks have already taken quite a toll on my scouts and messengers. I cannot afford to lose any more men. If we don't act soon, they'll have complete control over the roads and Zabra'jin will effectively be surrounded. "
1719,Concerns About Tuurem,Speak with Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. ,"The rumors from Tuurem are unsettling. Some say the town's ruins are overrun with crazed Broken and Lost Ones, while opportunistic artifact hunters steal draenei relics. It's hard to know which are true and which aren't, but we have a responsibility to safeguard the ruins as best we can. Find Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. He is something of a student of magical relics. More than anyone else, he's likely to know what's going on there. "
1720,More Fertile Spores,"We can always use more fertile spores, &lt; race&gt; . ","Your help is appreciated, <name>.  You will keep it up, yes? "
1721,Fulgor Spores,Bring 6 Fulgor Spores to Ruam at Telredor. ,"There is little in this swamp that will burn, <race>, so we must resort to other means for lighting Telredor. Many of the creatures and plants in the marsh emit a soft glow. It's difficult and cruel to confine the glowing creatures, so we've turned to a species of mushroom for our light source. We pick and cultivate the fulgor mushroom here, but our needs require us to gather new crops occasionally. The small green mushrooms often grow at the base of larger ones near Telredor. "
1722,The Dead Mire,Bring a Dead Mire Soil Sample to Vindicator Idaar at Telredor. ,"I have lived among the anchorites of Telredor for some time, <name>, and in that time I've come to know the marsh quite well. Recently, I've started to notice a disturbing change in the land to the northeast. Virtually all life there has begun to wither and die, seemingly without explanation. I have a few ideas as to what might be happening, but they are little more than speculation. If you were to bring me a sample of the soil in that area, I may be able to get to the bottom of this mystery. "
1723,"Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon! ",Bring Witch Doctor Tor'gash 6 Burstcap Mushrooms. ,"You like mushrooms, mon? There be a powerful one here in Zangarmarsh, growin' real close to Zabra'jin. You gotta be careful, though, mon. They be callin' it the burstcap for a reason. If you be gettin' too close without takin' the proper precautions, it'll blow right up on you! Poof! Right into a cloud o' toxic spores. I been usin' them for readin' the omens, but they be almost gone now. "
1724,Safeguarding the Watchers,Kill Lord Klaq and return to Windcaller Blackhoof at the Cenarion Refuge. ,"In your travels, you might have encountered some of the expedition's watchers. They do the majority of the field work: documenting the unique inhabitants of the marsh, collecting samples, and making contact with sentient species. The safety of the watchers is paramount, <class>. We've had to recall the watchers we sent to explore Funggor Cavern to the south, because of marshbeast attacks. Warden Hamoot believes that killing their leader, Lord Klaq, will bring a swift end to the attacks. "
1725,More Glowcaps,I'll take more glowcaps if you have them. ,"Thank you, <name>.  As Sporeggar's elder, I must ensure my people have adequate supplies.  You make my task that much easier. "
1726,The Biggest of Them All,Slay Mragesh and return to Zurjaya in Zabra'jin. ,"You've dealt with most of the little hydra, but I doubt Mragesh was impressed by your display. He's a cunning, ferocious beast and he's dogged many an angler in his time. I intend to be the last one he'll ever bother. He's bound to be hiding deep in the waters of Serpent Lake, to the northeast. He's a has-been; he just doesn't know it yet. "
1727,Secrets of the Daggerfen,Bring the Daggerfen Poison Manual and a Daggerfen Poison Vial to Timothy Daniels at the Orebor Harborage. ,"Bugs, bugs, bugs! The marsh is full of them and my companions here seem obsessed with them. Well, I've had it with the bugs! Something far more intriguing has captured my interest. To the west, there is a village of Lost Ones who call themselves the Daggerfen. The whole tribe consists of highly specialized assassins. I've noticed them mixing and using a particularly potent kind of poison. I'm dying to know more about the poison, but that's going to require a copy of the recipe and a sample vial. "
1728,Blessings of the Ancients,Windcaller Blackhoof wants you to speak to the ancients Ashyen and Keleth at Cenarion Refuge and obtain their blessings. ,"You've earned the trust of the Cenarion Expedition, <name>.  It is time you spoke to the ancients allied with our cause, Ashyen and Keleth, and asked for their blessing. Carrying the mark of an ancient will fill you with great power.  These boons will become more powerful as your renown among us increases. Go, <name>, and ask the ancients for their blessing. "
1729,Uncatalogued Species,Bring the Uncatalogued Species to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,Lauranna must've missed this particular plant.  You're certain you've discovered a species not yet catalogued by Lauranna's work.  You'd best show it to her to see what she makes of it. 
1730,Report to Shadow Hunter Denjai,Bring Zurai's Report to Shadow Hunter Denjai at Zabra'jin in Zangarmarsh. ,"Shadow Hunter Denjai will no doubt expect to receive a report about my progress in establishing our outpost. I've prepared a short summary of what we've accomplished here already, but with the loss of Scout Jyoba, I can't spare a runner to take the report to Denjai's base of Zabra'jin to the west. If you're headed that way, would you mind bringing this to him? Shadow Hunter Denjai can be a little intimidating at first, but once you get used to him, he's not so bad. "
1731,The Count of the Marshes,"Bring ""Count"" Ungula's Mandible to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Outpost in Zangarmarsh. ","This bloody mandible comes from an unbelievably large creature. The nether ray that it belonged to has to be the largest ever seen in Zangarmarsh. Judging from the condition of the mandible, the count must've abandoned a diet of carrion in favor of living flesh. Surely the Cenarion Expedition would be interested in such a specimen. Watcher Leesa'oh has a small camp to the west of Quagg Ridge. "
1732,Idols of the Feralfen,Gather 6 Feralfen Idols and return them to Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor. ,"From what you've told me about your observations at the Boha'mu Ruins, it seems this tribe of Lost Ones has reverted to the worship of animal spirits. Before we can approach them, we must know more of their beliefs. Return to Feralfen Village and discreetly gather some of their idols so that I may study them. Try to avoid angering them, <name>, as it may hurt our chances of making contact with them. "
1733,A Message to Telaar,Speak with Nahuud at Telaar in Nagrand. ,"You've been honorable in our dealings, <name>, at a time when trust is hard to win among my people. A large group of my brethren have made their home in the old draenei city of Telaar in Nagrand, to the south. To reach Telaar, take the road south into Nagrand, then continue southeast until you find yourself in the cliffs east of Oshu'gun. Anyone who has aided us, as you have, would be welcome among the people of Telaar. Seek out Nahuud and tell him you have earned my trust. "
1734,Us or Them,"Kill Overlord Gorefist, 10 Ango'rosh Maulers, and 10 Ango'rosh Souleaters and report back to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin. ","In order to end the Ango'rosh threat, we must kill their leader, Overlord Gorefist. We'll do better than that, though. We'll make an example of the overlord and his followers. Go to the Ango'rosh Stronghold and deal with our foes. The stronghold is located in a cave on a small island to the northwest of Zabra'jin. You'll see a bridge made from a fallen mushroom beyond the Ango'rosh Camp. Show no mercy, <name>. They certainly wouldn't spare any of us. "
1735,Lines of Communication,Puluu at the Orebor Harborage wants you to kill 12 Marshfang Slicers. ,"One of the reasons Ikuti led us to Zangarmarsh was to help open the lines of communication between the draenei and the Kurenai home city of Telaar in Nagrand. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and Telredor, the roads must be secured. On our way here, we were attacked repeatedly by marshfang slicers. We were able to fight them off, but they would pose a formidable threat to a solitary messenger. Reducing their numbers will help ensure the safety of our messengers. "
1736,Maktu's Revenge,"Locate and kill Mragesh, then return to Maktu at the Orebor Harborage. ","Last time Maktu was out hunting hydras for hides at Serpent Lake, he was attacked by the biggest hydra he's ever seen. Maktu reached for his spear, but it was too late. He had just enough time to escape becoming hydra food. Who knows? Maybe next time, Maktu not be so lucky. Maktu wants to be there so there won't be a next time. Will you help Maktu get his revenge on Mragesh? "
1737,Return to the Marsh,Return to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"Return to Ysiel and let her know that help will be extended to her as soon as it is possible. Affairs in Moonglade and Silithus have kept our members occupied, but we will do our best to send the necessary resources to the Cenarion Refuge. "
1738,Menacing Marshfangs,Kill 10 Marshfang Rippers and return to Noraani at Telredor. ,"During the orcs' war against my people, gatherers rarely left Telredor for fear of being attacked or captured. Now, we venture out more often, but the marsh is no less perilous. It seems that the nether rays have grown bolder in recent months. I don't know if it has something to do with more competition for their normal prey, but they've been attacking our foraging parties on a regular basis. If we can thin their ranks in the area around Telredor, perhaps they would learn to leave us alone. "
1739,Reinforcements for Garadar,Speak with Captain Kroghan at Garadar in Nagrand. ,"<Still catching his breath, the messenger gestures for you to sit. >They may not survive, <race>! Get to Garadar as quickly as your legs will carry you. <In response to your blank stare, the messenger elaborates. >The home of the Mag'har, lies to the south, in Nagrand. Take the southern road out of the marsh, then turn east at the first fork and look for a large settlement on the lake. Find our commander, Captain Kroghan, there and offer him what assistance you can. Garadar must not fall! "
1740,Stinger Venom,Bring 6 Marshlight Bleeder Venom to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage. ,"When I speak to draenei, I often get the sense that they consider themselves removed from their environment. Many seem to pity my brethren, the Broken, who they say have lost something. We Broken may have lost our inclination toward the Light, but our experiences have brought us closer to the land. My people see opportunities where few draenei do. Take, for example, the venom of the marshlight bleeders that live to the south and west. It has a wide variety of uses from hunting to healing. "
1741,Too Many Mouths to Feed,Kill 10 Mire Hydra and return to Haalrun at Telredor. ,"On my last hunting trip, I caught sight of a new outpost being built by a group of trolls. No doubt they've begun hunting these lands, too. If they establish a permanent presence out here, the competition for food will be fierce. We cannot take direct action against them without provocation, but we can remove some of the natural competition for food. For each mire hydra you kill, that's three fewer mouths to feed! "
1742,WANTED: Boss Grog'ak,Bring Boss Grog'ak's Head to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin. ,"Wanted - Dead or Alive: Boss Grog'ak, overseer of the Ango'rosh mushroom-cutting operation. This brute and his axe-wielding cronies are responsible for chopping down the mushrooms to the north of town. Unless he is stopped, he and his band will cut a path to the walls of Zabra'jin. <He/She> who presents the head of Boss Grog'ak to Shadow Hunter Denjai shall be well-rewarded. "
1743,Angling to Beat the Competition,Kill 10 Fenclaw Thrashers and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin. ,"It's a relief to be in someplace with water after trekking through the wasteland of Hellfire Peninsula. I was worried there might not be any respectable fishing holes in Outland. Now I'm glad I lugged my fishing supplies along. For the most part, the fishing's been good, except for those no good fenclaw thrashers in Serpent Lake. Not only do they scare the fish away, but they're bold enough to snap the bait right off my hook. I spend more time re-baiting the hook than I do catching anything! "
1744,Searching for Scout Jyoba,Search for Scout Jyoba at the Dead Mire in Zangarmarsh. ,"Now that you're familiar with the terrain, I'd like to ask your help with something else. The Dead Mire, we've taken to calling the area to the northwest, is an eerie place. No one has ever reported seeing anything alive there, but they didn't stay for very long, either. Scout Jyoba volunteered to investigate the area and report on his findings. He left the post three days ago and hasn't returned. It's not like him to be gone that long without sending some kind of report. Will you search for him, <name>? "
1745,Withered Basidium,Take the Withered Basidium to Ruam in Telredor in Zangarmarsh. ,"A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something. The alien mass of fungus presents something of a puzzle. It's far from healthy, but you have little clue as to what function it might normally perform. Perhaps someone more familiar with the denizens of Zangarmarsh would be able to tell you more about the basidium. "
1746,Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki,Bring Chieftain Mummaki's Totem to Shadow Hunter Denjai. ,"Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki - leader of the foul and degenerate Lost One tribe of the Daggerfen, for his brutal attacks against Zabra'jin and its inhabitants. The chieftain and his band of assassins are responsible for the deaths of numerous scouts and messengers and should only be approached by seasoned combatants. Travelers are advised to avoid the Daggerfen Village area to the northwest of Zabra'jin. To claim the bounty, present proof of the chietain's demise to Shadow Hunter Denjai. "
1747,Thick Hydra Scales,Zurai at Swamprat Post wants you to bring him 12 Thick Hydra Scales. ,"Reavij was wise to bring leather armor. This swamp will render my mail useless before long. I've been replacing the scales bit by bit as I'm able. The hydra in the marsh have thick, protective scales that stand up well to the dampness of their home. Finding suitable ones is a tedious process, though. All too often, the best scales are torn or worn too thin for use in armor. Bring me any good ones that you might get from the hydra in the larger lakes. "
1748,There's No Explanation for Fashion,Bring 8 Diaphanous Wings from any species of Zangarmarsh fireflies to Magasha in Swamprat Post. ,"< Magasha chuckles softly to herself. >I bet if they knew they were wearing bug parts, the fashion trend would end very quickly. We first started killing the bugs 'round here 'cause they were getting in the way of our construction. Some enterprising merchant stops here, spends the night, and next thing you know he's buyin' up all the bug wings we have! Says he makes clothes out of 'em. I be stickin' to my armor, thanks. But if you gather the wings of any of the fireflies, I'll gladly buy 'em. "
1749,Impending Attack,Bring the Ango'rosh Attack Plans to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin. ,"The position of the ogres' mushroom-cutting operation can't be an accident. I can't escape the suspicion that they're preparing for an attack on Zabra'jin. I must know for certain, <name>. The ogres have another outpost to the northwest, the Ango'rosh Grounds. If they're staging for an attack, there will be evidence of their plans there. Go there, <name> and search the camp for signs of their intentions. Return to me with anything that might be suspicious. "
1750,Warning the Cenarion Circle,Speak to Amythiel Mistwalker at Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula. ,"The Cenarion Expedition has become a large organization with a good degree of autonomy.  These events are important enough that we need to warn the Cenarion Circle. Do not worry, I will not ask you to travel back to Moonglade; we have emissaries as nearby as Hellfire Peninsula. "
1751,Withered Basidium,Bring the Withered Basidium to Reavij at Swamprat Post in Zangarmarsh. ,"A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something. The alien mass of fungus presents something of a puzzle. It's far from healthy, but you have little clue as to what function it might normally perform. Perhaps someone more familiar with the denizens of Zangarmarsh would be able to tell you more about the basidium. "
1752,Return to the Marsh,Return to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"Return to Ysiel and let her know that help will be extended to her as soon as it is possible. Affairs in Moonglade and Silithus have kept our members occupied, but we will do our best to send the necessary resources to the Cenarion Refuge. "
1753,Unfinished Business,Prospector Conall at Telredor wants you to kill Sporewing. ,"The first expedition the league sent reported encountering a gigantic spore bat they'd taken to calling Sporewing. They had to leave in a hurry, so they didn't have the chance to kill him while they were here, so I figured I'd finish the job for them. What's left of their report suggests that the creature can be found in the southwestern parts of the Dead Mire. I think Vindicator Idaar mentioned that it's to the northeast of Telredor. "
1754,The Orebor Harborage,Speak to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage in Zangarmarsh. ,"As you know, many of Telredor's inhabitants are refugees from the war that decimated the draenei. It is my goal to maintain Telredor as a safe haven for all of our allies in this struggle. There are some who desire to join us, but feel they are not yet ready. We owe them whatever help we can provide, <name>. A group of Broken under the leadership of Ikuti have taken shelter in the ruins of an old temple to the northwest of Serpent Lake. Seek them out and extend your hand in friendship to them. "
1755,Diaphanous Wings,Haalrun at Telredor wants you to bring him 8 Diaphanous Wings from any of the firefly species in Zangarmarsh. ,"Living in such a remote location has taught us to make use of everything available. Of course, you have to learn to stop thinking about where some of these materials come from first. I've found that the wings of the umbraglow stingers are very helpful for waterproofing. They're strong, thin, and flexible. < Haalrun chuckles. >I see the look on your face. Like I said, it takes time to get used to the idea. If you're going to be out and about, would you mind bringing me some of the wings? "
1756,News from Zangarmarsh,Speak with Mokasa at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. ,"Shadow Hunter Denjai isn't the only one expecting a report from me. Mokasa at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar is eager to hear of our progress, especially since most of her messengers travel through here. She asked me to send word once Swamprat Post was completed. If you wouldn't mind delivering the news, I'd be very grateful. We may be up and running, but there is still much to be done. To get to Stonebreaker Hold, follow the road south out of Zangarmarsh, into Terokkar Forest and beyond Tuurem. "
1757,The Sharpest Blades,Bring 10 Marshfang Slicer Blades to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin. ,"The damp atmosphere of the marsh has taken a toll on my metal tools. It's made woodworking a lot more difficult than it ought to be, so I've given up on metal blades. It turns out that the marshfang slicers living to the south and west of town grow blades that are sharper than any steel I've ever owned. They're also resistant to rust and wear. It's just a little tricky to attach them to a handle, but I think I've got it figured out. I'd appreciate any blades you could bring me. "
1758,Menacing Marshfangs,Reavij at Swamprat Post wants you to kill 10 Marshfang Rippers. ,"Sometimes I wish Denjai had sent a shaman with us, or at least given us a totem to keep the marshfang rippers at bay. The whole place is crawling with the pests! It's just not right. Shouldn't something be eating these despicable things? We've all been taking turns playing exterminator. You showed up at just the right time, <name>. Congratulations! Now get out there and mop up some marshfangs! "
1759,Stinging the Stingers,Kill 8 Marshlight Bleeders and return to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin. ,"It's impossible to work with all this infernal buzzing! Do you hear it? I can't get it out of my head! I know exactly what's making the noise, too. It's those damnable marshlight bleeders! The noise always comes from the south and west of the village. They're too big to swat, crush underfoot, or wave away. The only way to stop that unholy droning is to kill them. I don't care how you do it, <name>, just quiet them! "
1760,A Question of Gluttony,Collect 10 pieces of Discarded Nutriment and then return to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh. ,"I was wondering why the bog lords were crossing the road to go to the Spawning Glen - they must be starving for some reason.  This just will not do! I mean, normally I wouldn't get involved, but if they continue to eat all of the sporeling pods they'll wipe them out! Here's what we'll do: I'll stay here and you head to the Quagg Ridge to the east and look for dietary clues as to why they're raiding the sporelings. "
1761,Observing the Sporelings,"Investigate the Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh, and then report back to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh with your findings. ",We need to learn all that we can of the sporelings at Sporeggar and their relationship to the creatures around them.  One way to do that is what I'm doing; passive observation while making a note of their interactions. I need you to head over to the Spawning Glen to the west.  Investigate the whole area and then return to tell me what you saw. 
1762,Assassin's Contract,Bring the Assassin's Contract to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore. ,"This is a contract for the assassination of Magistrate Henry Maleb.  It was sealed and stamped in red wax, using a distinctive signet ring. "
1763,Valik,Bring a mug of Southshore Stout to Valik in the Syndicate camp. ,"Urrgh. . . Injured and dying and confronted with the enemy. No doubt you'll kill me anyway, but if you bring me some Southshore stout --your kind does drink, don't they? --I'll tell you what you want to know. "
1764,Baron's Demise,Bring the Head of Baron Vardus to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore. ,"The contract you recovered was signed by Baron Vardus, a noble of the former kingdom of Alterac, and one known for a cold heart and brutal practices.  I'm not surprised someone like the Baron was behind this. Find this man.  Find him, and bring him to justice.  He must be among the Syndicate haunts - perhaps at the ruins of Strahnbrad, or perhaps within the valley north of them. "
1765,Dark Council,Kill 4 Argus Shadow Mages. ,"The letter you brought me was written by a being who calls himself Nagaz, a member of the Argus Wake.  I don't know what this Argus Wake is, but if they're in alliance with the Syndicate then they must be a threat. I want you to find Nagaz and the Argus Shadow Mages mentioned in that letter.  I want you to find them, and kill them. Search in the Uplands, where the Syndicate is strongest.  It is north of Strahnbrad. With luck, you'll find these envoys of the Argus Wake there. "
1766,Crushridge Warmongers,"Slay 10 Crushridge Warmongers, then return to Marshal Redpath in Southshore. ","Now that you've had a taste of the Crushridge ogres, I want you to really bloody their noses. . . Go into the Ruins of Alterac and seek out the Crushridge Warmongers.  I want you to cut down a good number of them - that's the only way those brutes will learn to keep their distance from Alliance territory. "
1767,Syndicate Assassins,"Kill 12 Syndicate Footpads and 8 Syndicate Thieves, then return to Magistrate Henry Maleb in Southshore. ","I am the new magistrate of Southshore, recently assigned after the assassination of the previous magistrate.  The assassins were never found, but through our investigations we're almost certain they were hired by the Syndicate - a group of thieves led by villainous nobles of the now fallen kingdom of Alterac. The Syndicate has a camps in Sofera's Naze and Corahn's Dagger, north and west of the Horde-occupied Tarren Mill.  Slay the Syndicate members you find in these camps. "
1768,Further Mysteries,Bring the Decrypted Letter to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore. ,"I decrypted the letter, but I don't know what to make of it.  You found this among thieves in the Alterac foothills?  Very strange. . . You should take this to the magistrate of Southshore.  Although this letter is cryptic, his is the closest town to Alterac; if a threat is brewing, then he should know. "
1769,Contact from Dalaran,Bring Alturus's Report to Archmage Cedric in the outskirts of Dalaran Crater. ,"These signs do not bode well for us, <name>.  I've never been one for secrecy so I will tell you a bit about my organization, the Violet Eye. We are agents of the Kirin Tor, the Magus Senate of Dalaran.  We were assigned to keep an eye on Karazhan and Medivh, in case things got out of hand. Which they did. . . very quickly, after Medivh disappeared. This report details my findings.  Take it to Archmage Cedric, also from the Violet Eye; you will find him in the outskirts of Dalaran Crater. "
1770,Stormpike's Deciphering,Take the Ensorcelled Parchment to Prospector Stormpike in Ironforge. ,"Prospector Stormpike is a master of decryption and deciphering.  If you take the parchment you found to him, then with luck he can make sense of it.  Stormpike is currently studying in the Prospector headquarters in Ironforge. And when you see him tell him you spoke with me - I've been sending him quite a lot of business lately. "
1771,Crushridge Bounty,Gather 9 Dirty Knucklebones from Crushridge ogres in the Alterac Mountains. ,"Crushridge ogres have dug an ogre mound up in the Alterac Mountains near the ruined city of Alterac.  And my scouts tell me they've taken over those ruins as well. We can't let them get cozy up there; if they think they're safe where they are, then their next step will be to move down into the foothills, which will put them right at our front door! Go north to the Alterac Mountains and hunt ogres.  Bring me the Dirty Knucklebones they carry and you will earn a nice bounty. "
1772,The Ensorcelled Parchment,Take the Ensorcelled Parchment to Loremaster Dibbs at Southshore in Hillsbrad Foothills. ,"This parchment is enchanted with a spell, rendering it indecipherable.  But one word at the top of the paper can be read: Nagaz"
1773,Noble Deaths,Bring 7 Alterac Signet Rings to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore. ,"I fear the leadership behind the Syndicate is bent on Southshore's ruin.  We must strike hard at these leaders before their plans are realized. Enter the ruins of Strahnbrad, in the Alterac Mountains to the north.  We think the Syndicate is using the area as a headquarters. We know this gang of cutthroats is run by former Alterac nobles.  They may be hiding as normal Syndicate agents, but you'll know you've killed a noble by the signet ring he wears. Bring me those signet rings. "
1774,Foreboding Plans,Bring the Foreboding Plans to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore. ,"Among these documents is a list of requested supplies.  These include mundane items (food, weapons, clothing) as well as more exotic gear (masks, oil, poison). But what is most notable is the urgency of the request - these supplies were needed soon in order to undertake what is described in the document as an ""important mission against Southshore. """
1775,The New Directive,Speak to Archmage Cedric in the outskirts of Dalaran Crater. ,"Return to Cedric at once, <name>.  The aid you've given the Violet Eye will not go unrewarded. Think what you want of us and our organization, <class>, but gaining the favor of the archmages of Dalaran will not be something you regret. "
1776,Encrypted Letter,Bring the Encrypted Letter to Loremaster Dibbs in Southshore. ,One of the letters on this table is encrypted and inscrutable. 
1777,Letter to Stormpike,Take the Cleverly Encrypted Letter to Prospector Stormpike in Ironforge. ,"I have a colleague in Ironforge who may be able to help decrypt this letter.  Go to the Library in the Hall of Explorers in Ironforge and speak with Prospector Stormpike.  Tell him I sent you and show him the letter.  If there's anyone north of Blackrock Spire who can read this, it is he. "
1778,Remember Alterac Valley! ,Bring 3 Alterac Valley Marks of Honor to an Alliance Brigadier General outside the battlegrounds. ,"Make no mistake about it, <name>.  The Horde is quite right when they say Alterac Valley is Frostwolf Territory. You see, the Stormpike Expedition arrived as peaceful visitors to the area in search of ore and relics.  The Frostwolves reacted with the most brutal and uncivilized act of aggression the Alliance has experienced. Let us never forget the brave dwarves that perished in that cowardly unannounced attack.  Go now, <class>, do your part in the battle for Alterac Valley.  For the Alliance! "
1779,Invaders of Alterac Valley,"The battle for Alterac rages on! &nbsp; You must return to Alterac Valley and once more drive the invaders out of Frostwolf territory, &lt; name&gt; ! . ","Good work, <name>!  You should be proud of yourself.  The Alliance invaders must be expelled from Alterac! "
1780,Remember Alterac Valley! ,"The Battle in Alterac Valley rages on, &lt; name&gt; ! &nbsp; Have you done your part as of late, &lt; name&gt; ? A level 60 Quest (PvP). ","You continue to honor the Alliance, <name>.  The Horde will be crushed before long if we keep our efforts up. "
1781,The Princess Trapped,See The Princess Trapped. ,"My name is Myzrael.  I am a princess of the earth, and my captors, the giants, have trapped me deep beneath the Arathi Highlands.  These crystal shards are the only way I can speak with the surface world. Please help me.  Allies of the giants, the Drywhisker Kobolds, have a shard like this one in their Drywhisker Gorge, to the east.  To power the cluster, you must gather Motes of Myzrael from the kobolds and apply them to it. I beg you, <name>, aid me! "
1782,Foul Magics,Retrieve Marez Cowl's Bloodstone Orb and bring it to Tor'gan in Hammerfall. ,"There is no doubt in my mind that a powerful warlock resides within the walls of Stromgarde. From time to time, using an arcane magical relic, this warlock has summoned forth terrible demons in large numbers. We must remove the source of his energy. Find the warlock and kill him. Bring me whatever magical object you find on his person, and I will take steps to destroy it and see that its power is not used to taint this land any longer. "
1783,Breaking the Keystone,Find and kill Fozruk. ,"Opening the Stones of Binding loosened much of my confinement, but a lock still holds me chained.  It is the Keystone you see among this circle of stones.  And the key is held by one of my captors, the stone watcher Fozruk. You must obtain that key, which the stone watchers call the Rod of Order, from Fozruk and use it to open the Keystone. <name>, you have done so much to aid me.  Just a little more. . . and my gratitude will shake the very foundations of the earth! "
1784,Summoning the Princess,"Go to the Shards of Myzrael, summon her and defeat her. ","You must defeat Myzrael before she grows in strength.  If you do not, then once she has gathered enough power she will challenge her captors!  There are some who think they can control her, but if she can be controlled then why did the giants chain her in the first place? ? Crazy logic, eh? To defeat her, summon her at the Shards of Myzrael where you first spoke with her.  Defeat her and gather her Eldritch Shackles, then bind them to the Shards of Myzrael. Do that, and she will again be trapped. "
1785,Sigil of Trollbane,Kill Prince Galen Trollbane and bring the Sigil of Trollbane to Zengu in Hammerfall. ,"The final of the sigils needed to unlock the tomb of Thoras Trollbane is held by his son personally. He resides deep within Stromgarde, in a chapel in the militia-held districts. Prince Galen is well protected and no slouch of a warrior himself, so this task could prove most difficult. "
1786,Sigil of Arathor,Retrieve the Sigil of Arathor and return it to Zengu in Hammerfall. ,"Though they can barely be said to control Stromgarde, let alone the whole of Arathi Highlands, the human prince trots the remnants of his cavalry over the countryside. I can't understand why he does it, but who understands the way the humans think, hm? Whatever his reasoning, more importantly, he has given one of the sigils to Lieutenant Valorcall, their cavalry leader. Locate him and bring his sigil back to me. "
1787,Trol'kalar,Deliver Trol'kalar to Zengu in Hammerfall. ,"The light slowly fades, the sword Trol'kalar, held within a stone sheath has been released. "
1788,Crystal in the Mountains,Find the crystal from your vision. ,"This shard pulses as you hold it. . . You feel a sense of pleading coming from the shard, as if someone is trying to communicate, someone who desperately needs your help. A vision appears in your mind - of the northern mountains of Arathi, and of a brilliant crystal jutting from the earth there. You feel drawn to that place. "
1789,Theldurin the Lost,Find Theldurin the Lost. ,"Theldurin the Lost was once a member of our order, the Twilight's Hammer.  But he lost his mind and scorned our teachings.  And before he fled from us, he stole the scroll of Myzrael!  We could not catch him, but rumors say he hides in the Badlands, gibbering and mad. To bring the Lady back to us, you must find the scroll.  And to do that, you must find Theldurin. "
1790,Malin's Request,Take the Sealed Letter to Archmage Malin in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. ,"Take this letter back to Stormwind and let Malin know that Kryten an' I'll be home soon. He'll reward you well for helping us here, <name>, of that I've no doubt. Travel safely. "
1791,Trol'kalar,Retrieve Trol'kalar from Trollbane's tomb in Stromgarde. ,"What's this? With the four sigils brought together, they have formed together to create one sigil. There can be no doubt that this will be able to break the wardings placed upon Trollbane's tomb. Trollbane's remains are entombed in the Sanctum behind the chapel in Stromgarde. Retrieve Trol'kalar. "
1792,Trelane's Defenses,Find an Azure Agate and bring it to Apprentice Kryten at Refuge Pointe. ,"All rested? Here's our next step: there're ogres all around the Tower of Arathor in Stromgarde. We're gonna need to activate the tower's defenses if you're gonna stand a chance against 'em an' still make it to the items alive. To do that, we're gonna need some gems the Boulderfist shaman have taken a liking to. They took 'em from the tower, but they're not gonna stay in their possession for long. Get one of them gems an' bring 'em to Kryten--he knows the spell to enchant 'em so they'll work as a key. "
1793,Wand over Fist,Find Trelane's Wand of Invocation and return it to Skuerto at Refuge Pointe. ,"Hey, <name>. Sorry to be so short with ye earlier. . . and no, that ain't a pun. I figured out where Trelane's first item ended up: Kor'gresh has it in Boulderfist Hall. An' by the way he was throwing down blasts of ice at his kin to keep them in line, he must be close to figurin' out how to use all of its powers. Boulderfist Hall's south of here an' then east of Thandol Span. Find the ogre an' get back that wand. While you're gone, I'll figure out what we're gonna do about Stromgarde. "
1794,The Real Threat,Slay Or'Kalar and bring his Head to Korin Fel in the Hammerfall outpost. ,"You serve my husband well, <class>, but he does not know why Hammerfall is under attack. Or'Kalar, Mug'thol's pawn in Stromgarde, has an intense hatred for my husband, and wishes nothing more than my husband's death for defeating him years ago. My auguries tell me that Or'Kalar has laid a trap for my husband, so I have hidden signs of the ogre's presence from him. My husband will rush off foolishly if he learns of the ogre's whereabouts and I would ask for your help in slaying the creature. "

All three should be in chests within the tower an' you shouldn't have a problem opening the chests on your own; you just have to be careful of the ogres. The tower's defenses won't take care of 'em on their own; you'll need to have your weapons at the ready. Those ogres find out you're there and stealing from 'em, an' they'll be sure to put the hurt on you. Be careful, an' good luck. "
1797,An Apprentice's Enchantment,Speak to Skuerto at Refuge Pointe in Arathi Highlands. ,"Here you are, <name>. The gem only needs to be pressed against one of the pedestals near the base of the tower to activate its defenses. Use it when you're ready to enter the tower and find Trelane's remaining items.

1801,The Broken Sigil,"Retrieve the 5 Sigil Fragments from the defenders in Stromgarde, and bring them to Tor'gan in Hammerfall. ","Thoras Trollbane's tomb is protected by three sigils--the first of which you retrieved from the Syndicate.

Captain O'Breen said we'd only be here for a few hours.  Just long enough to gather the treasure and get back to Booty Bay. But Lolo thinks we're going to be here a lot longer than that.

But the power harnessed in these goggles will allow you to locate them easily. A little gnomish ingenuity goes a long way! So borrow the Goggles of Gem Hunting, <name>, and see if you can collect some of the lost treasure for Captain O'Breen. I'd swim down there myself but. . . um. . . well, I have important scientific business to tend to up on the safe, dry land. . . . er, yeah. "

But as you can see, we're not in much of a position to get out of here. Not only is the tide too low, but those damned creatures we disrupted are keeping a close eye on our movements.

Take him this sample as proof. "

","The Witherbark trolls and Boulderfist ogres of Arathi are working together to rid us from this land, but we shall not meet our fates at their, or anyone else's, hand.

1808,Foul Magics,Get 10 Bloodstone Amulets for Tor'gan in Hammerfall. ,"I have felt a strangeness in the air. . . a feeling that simmers in my blood. I had my suspicions. I set off to find the source of my unease and discovered to the west, at Northfold Manor, the residual traces of demonic summoning. As I got close, my blood began to boil and the rage within me grew. On the ground I spied an amulet of bloodstone, used to assist in demonic summoning. The one I found was depleted, however. I'll need another to examine, but I dare not return to the manor. Can you bring me some? "

1814,Death From Below,Protect Shakes O'Breen during the attack. ,"This is bad. It seems the Daggerspines are amassing for an attack. Naga are known for their ruthlessness in battle. They will keep attacking until I am dead. I don't value my own life above that of my crew members, but you must help to defend me. The crew will not be able to make it back to Booty Bay without my knowledge of the seas. The naga will be coming from the sea. I need you to remain up here with me to fend off the attack. Man the cannon and drive them back. Are you ready, <name>? "
1815,Sunken Treasure,Escort Professor Phizzlethorpe to the cave and back. ,"Now that we are full-fledged Blackwater Raiders it is our job to help Mr. O'Breen locate the lost elven treasure. It is next to impossible to find the gems in the dark sea without aid. The doctor has constructed some goggles that will help.

1817,Guile of the Raptor,Speak with Tor'gan at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands. ,"This. . . this power. . . . Is this the power of the shamans that Tor'gan tried to show me?

1818,Hammerfall,Speak with Tor'gan in Hammerfall. ,"It is still clear to me, like yesterday. . . So many years without hope, with wood and steel to bind me to this terrible place. Then finally, finally! There was the Warchief. Doomhammer in his midnight plate, his warhammer held high. It was. . . too terrible. . . That the blow of a coward would strike down our greatest hero. From behind he charged on his horse, and then his lance ran him through. . . I fell to my knees. What hope was there? What hope is there. . . "
1819,Northfold Manor,Kill 10 Syndicate Highwaymen and 6 Syndicate Mercenaries. ,"We are fighting a war for Stromgarde, and we are losing.  The ogres, the Syndicate and we have divided our once great city, and each faction battles the other into a bloody stalemate. But our forces dwindle while our enemy grows. We need help from the town of Southshore, but supplies are difficult to receive while the Syndicate holds territory between us. Go to the Syndicate base in Northfold Manor and slay them.  Then, perhaps, pressure on our supply trains will lessen and more will get through. "
1820,Guile of the Raptor,Acquire 12 Raptor Hearts from Highland Fleshstalkers for Tor'gan. ,"With some additional objects, I will be able to create an item that will imbue Gor'mul with the guile of the raptor!

1822,Raising Spirits,Speak with Tor'gan at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands. ,"< Gor'mul tosses the amulet into the ground. > Tor'gan sent you, didn't he? Pah!

1823,Deep Sea Salvage,First Mate Nilzlix wants you to retrieve the Charts and Logs from the Maiden's Folly and the Spirit of Silverpine. ,"O'Breen led the ships into the cove.  We were certain this is where the treasure could be found.  The Harbinger docked safely but as the Maiden's Folly and Spirit of Silverpine approached the tides began to lower.  Strangest thing I've ever seen! Those two ships ran aground into something. . . some sort of temple in the reef.  They sank so quickly, was quite a tragedy. We need to retrieve their Logs as well as their Charts before we leave.  We can't leave that information behind for prying eyes! "
1824,Drowned Sorrows,Captain Steelgut in Faldir's Cove wants you to kill 10 Daggerspine Raiders and 3 Daggerspine Sorceresses. ,"Argh, 'tis a horrible life. I should be in a watery grave right now, not sittin' here by the fire, breathin' fresh air. The crew tried so hard to save my beautiful Maiden's Folly. Bless the boys, bless their hearts. O'Breen made it to shore safely but we weren't so lucky. The seas just sank on us, I swear. One second we're afloat and the next water is rushin' in. And those beasts! Killed all the survivors. Horrible naga scum. I went black and ended up here, saved. I want those beasts dead. "
1825,Raising Spirits,Acquire 10 Highland Raptor Eyes from Highland Striders and Highland Thrashers for Tor'gan in Hammerfall. ,"We tried to settle him in, cheer him up, telling him stories of our mighty city at Orgrimmar in Kalimdor, but nothing would move him. Tales of our young Warchief, Thrall, who bears the armor and hammer of Orgrim. . . but, perhaps. . . Perhaps! A demonstration of our newly found shamanistic magic would give him new hope. It is worth a try! A small object we could make for him, yes. . . Bring me some raptor eyes, and I will see what I can do. "
1826,Claiming Arathi Basin,"The war against the Horde is quickly depleting our supplies, &lt; name&gt; . ","Excellent work, <class>!  Your efforts will help to provide the Alliance with the resources it needs. "
1827,Sunken Treasure,Deliver Seahorn's Letter to Shakes O'Breen at Faldir's Cove in Arathi Highlands. ,"Say, <name>, you seem to be an adventurous type. My fleet is stuck in Booty Bay until we can restock.

Can I trust you to deliver this message safely and in confidence? "

1830,Conquering Arathi Basin,Bring 3 Arathi Basin Mark of Honor to a Horde Warbringer outside the battlegrounds. ,"Our conflict with the Alliance has escalated to a true war.  No longer are false pretenses to enter into battle used or expected by either side at this point. The battle for the Arathi Basin is one of resources, plain and simple.  Either the Alliance gets the resources and uses them against us or we get them and use them to keep our war efforts going.  Help the Defilers maintain the flow of resources we need, <name>! "
1831,"The Star, the Hand and the Heart",Return the items on the Bonegrip's Note to Gerrig Bonegrip in Ironforge. ,"Yagyin's Digest, eh?  Are you starting a new chapter of us, somewhere?

Bring them to me and I will give you the digest. I will not speak their names.  Ears may be on us.  But here, I will write them down. "
1832,Coolant Heads Prevail,Find Frost Oil and bring it to Lotwil Veriatus in Badlands. ,"Let me tell you something about Frost Oil: nothing can keep an engine or gears from overheating quite like it. Its cooling properties are extraordinary, and its longevity as a lubricant without equal. That's not all: it also aids in retaining enchantments on magical items. I need a vial of it to increase the magical capacity of my shackles and make them powerful enough to stop our summoned friend from killing us all. Bro'kin, a goblin friend of mine, can teach you to make it. He's in Alterac. "
1833,Pearl Diving,Bring 9 Blue Pearls to Rigglefuzz in the Badlands. ,"The Badlands is a harsh place, filled with vicious predators and bold scavengers.  Scary, especially for a short little goblin.  To survive, I have to be tricky! I know the recipe for flash bombs.  I use those to scare away wildlife.  But I'm running low on one of the ingredients: crushed blue pearl powder.  Get me some and I'll make it worth your efforts. Heh, and I hope you have good boots on.  The Blue Pearls I need are found from clams at the Vile Reef. Yep, the Vile Reef in Stranglethorn! "
1834,Broken Alliances,Kill Boss Tho'grun and bring the Sign of the Earth to Gorn in Kargath. ,"From the Horde's alliance with the dragon Deathwing during the Second War, we know that two of his lieutenants, Blacklash and Hematus, were imprisoned within Lethlor Ravine far to the east. We must silence our depraved allies of old to restore honor to the Horde!

Tho'grun betrayed us though, overwhelming us and taking it for himself. Go to Camp Boff and take it back! "
1835,Broken Alliances,"Use the Sign of the Earth to activate the Pillars of Diamond, Opal, and Amethyst and obtain the Runestones. ","The Seal of the Earth is held by three runestones, held in the Pillars of Diamond, Opal, and Amethyst in Lethlor Ravine. Using the Sign of the Earth, you will be able to remove the runestones and unlock the Seal of the Earth. Be wary though, <name>, the black drakes Blacklash and Hematus are not to be trifled with. See them dead and return their bindings to me. To reach the ravine, travel to the far eastern part of the Badlands.  Be careful though, for the ravine is home to countless drakes. "
1836,Tremors of the Earth,Retrieve the Sign of the Earth for Garek. ,"I heard from Sigrun that you have been a great help to him. Perhaps I might enlist your help. I was sent here by my master, Krasus of the Kirin Tor, to put an end to the trouble brewing in Lethlor Ravine. I cannot divulge the exact nature of my assignment here or the tasks that I must undertake, but be assured it is of vital importance. A band of wandering ogres, sometimes seen near Camp Boff, stole an object called the Sign of the Earth; I must have it. Bring it to me, and I will tell you more. "

What? ,Bring a Gyrochronatom to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands. ,"<name>, you've done your job well beyond all standards. <Lotwil's obviously distracted by his work. >If we ever meet in Kharanos, feel free to come apply for work.

1838,Barbecued Buzzard Wings,Bring 4 Buzzard Wings to Rigglefuzz. ,"Oh yes, my barbecued buzzard wings are a favorite!  The sauce is rich and the meat is tangy.  And the smell will bring the hungry running from miles away! I have everything I need to cook up a batch.  Everything. . . except the buzzard wings! If you want some then get me the buzzard wings.  Bring me enough, and I might even share the recipe with you! "
1839,Forbidden Knowledge,Bring Yagyin's Digest to Theldurin. ,"I have the digest for you, <name>.  I need not tell you to take great care with it.  And to keep it far from unfriendly hands. This book holds many truths. . . . . . And the truth can burn. "
1840,The Lost Fragments,"Bring the Torn Scroll Fragment, the Crumpled Scroll Fragment and the Singed Scroll Fragment to Theldurin the Lost. ","The Scroll of Myzrael. . . the Scroll of Myzrael? !  You don't want that!  Its magic can pull Myzrael to the surface world and if you do that, we are in trouble! Or. . . maybe it's too late.  Maybe she already is free.  Maybe she's just gathering strength before unleashing herself upon us.  If so, then you'll NEED the scroll! . . . too bad it's destroyed.  Enraged elementals stole it and tore it up and now fight over the fragments. But if you can gather those fragments, maybe we can fix it. . . "
1841,A Sign of Hope,Find Prospector Ryedol and let him know Hammertoe Grez is alive. ,"<There is text roughly scribbled in chalk on the map. >""Ryedol, They're taking me to Uldaman. Send help. -Hammertoe"""

This is a groundbreaking day for all of us. "
1843,Tremors of the Earth,"Use the Sign of the Earth to activate the Pillars of Amethyst, Opal, and Diamond and obtain the Runestones. ","It has become obvious that we cannot ensure that Blacklash and Hematus will remain imprisoned in Lethlor. That black dragons have taken up residence there, and that the ogres managed to steal the Sign indicates that more drastic measures will have to be taken. The drakes' prison is maintained by three runestones that may only be retrieved using the Sign of the Earth. Those runestones can then be used to break the seal which imprisons them. <name>. . . assure that their dreams are eternal. "

I need you to find Agmond so I can get his report. Last I heard Agmond was at the southernmost dig site in the Badlands --a tiny operation past the Angor Fortress.  I'd start your search for him there. "
1846,To Ironforge for Yagyin's Digest,Give the Sigil of the Hammer to Gerrig Bonegrip in the Forlorn Cavern of Ironforge. ,"The Tablet tells much.  But not enough!  Not nearly enough!

Knowledge to protect us! Go to Gerrig Bonegrip.  He is in a shop in Ironforge, in the Forlorn Cavern.  Show him this sigil and he'll think you one of them.  Ask him for Yagyin's Digest. . . and bring it to me! "
1847,Stone Is Better than Cloth,Bring some Patterned Bronze Bracers to Lucien Tosselwrench in the Badlands. ,"I know how cheap Lotwil can be, <name>, so let me make you something for all your troubles. Maybe it'll even help protect you from the coming atrocity that is Lotwil's newest invention. I've been working with all the extra stones you collected for him, and I can make some nice bracers that you might want to use. They're enchanted, of course. I'll just need patterned bronze bracers crafted by a blacksmith so I can complete the bracers I'm making for you. "
1848,Liquid Stone,Bring a Healing Potion and a Lesser Invisibility Potion to Lucien Tosselwrench in the Badlands. ,"I'm thinking those items you acquired for Lotwil are going to be the least of our worries, <name>.

1849,Unclaimed Baggage,Retrieve the Advisor's Pack and Advisor's Rapier from their holding places in the Angor Fortress and return them to Advisor Sarophas at Kargath. ,"This is Kargath? Oh, dear. I expected a, a. . . well, some kind of settlement, some sign of civilization here in the wilderness. There must be a mistake; surely this hovel full of uncouth, unwashed, sniggering savages can't be the headquarters of the Expeditionary Force. The loutish barbarians had the gall to laugh at me when I told them about how the Dark Iron dwarves robbed me and then disappeared into the Angor Fortress. I can count on you to help me recover my possessions and my dignity, can't I? "
1850,An Ambassador of Evil,Kill Ambassador Infernus in Angor Fortress and bring proof of his death to Advisor Belgrum in Ironforge. ,"Ambassador Infernus was sent to Angor Fortress by Ragnaros himself to mind the Shadowforge seeking lost artifacts in Uldaman. It has already meant tremendous casualties for our people, but it has obviously grown worse. I hesitate to guess how many artifacts they would be able to find and use against Ironforge. Our goal is simple, <class>. Return to the Badlands and destroy Ambassador Infernus. Once the threat is eliminated, return to Advisor Belgrum with proof of your victory. It is in your hands now. "
1851,Fiery Blaze Enchantments,Acquire a Black Drake's Heart for Sigrun Ironhew. ,"As an apprentice to Feranor Steeltoe, I learned his special technique for imbuing weapons with fiery enchantments. Last I heard of him, he was working at a smithy with a hunting party up in Lordaeron. I can't tell you too many of the details about the process, but I can tell you it requires blood from a rare, still-beating black drake whelp's heart.

1852,This Is Going to Be Hard,Speak to Lucien Tosselwrench in the Badlands. ,"Wonderful, wonderful. <Lotwil looks up at you for a moment before going back to his shackles. >Go speak to Lucien, <name>. I need a cog #5. Bring it to me, will you? "
1853,Scrounging,Get 7 pieces of Scrap Metal for Sigrun. ,"It's going to be tough going here if I can't manage to scrounge up some materials to construct some defenses and other necessities. I've noticed that the ogres in the area seem to be well equipped with scrap metal. Maybe the stories of siege engines in the Badlands weren't so far off after all. . . Anyways, the Prospector's been getting worried about the state of our little camp, so I'd like to get working soon if I can. The main ogre camp is at Dustbelch Grotto, a good trek to the west of here. "

Knowledge to protect us! Go to Keeper Bel'dugur in the Undercity of Lordaeron.  Show him this sigil and he'll think you one of them.  Ask him for Yagin's Digest. . . and bring it to me! "

Bring 'im me amulet. <cough cough> He'll. . . <cough> figure out what to do. He knows I was seeking the origins of our people, and he. . . <cough>. . . knows it was also my mission to stop the Shadowforge clan. They must not be allowed to find the scrolls. . . <cough>"
1857,Study of the Elements: Rock,Bring 5 Bracers of Rock Binding to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands. ,"<name>, there's one more part I need from the elementals here in the Badlands: the bracers of rock binding from the greater rock elementals. By my calculations, those bracers should be enough to gauge the strength of my own shackles. My attempts at scrying the greater rock elementals showed a group of them southwest of here, near some ogres if I recall. Bring me 5 of their bracers just so I have extras. Servo's notorious for misplacing my reagents and research. "
1858,Mirages,Retrieve the Supply Crate for Sigrun Ironhew. ,"In our hurry to leave the Uldaman excavation site, we were forced to abandon many wagons and crates of supplies along the way. The local ogres from Camp Kosh have been on our abandoned equipment like vultures on a rotting corpse. Don't smell much better, either. Than the corpses, I mean. Anyways, they took the cart that was carrying all our weapons and such. . . so--well, this is a bit embarrassing--we haven't been able to get any food. We're in a bit of a pickle here, suppose you could help us out? "
1859,Prospect of Faith,Take Hammertoe's Amulet to Historian Karnik in Ironforge. ,"Okay, okay. . . who would know what to do? Historian Karnik! That's it! He's in Ironforge. He'll be able to help. He and Hammertoe were workin' together to find the lost artifacts in Uldaman. Guess the Shadowforge found out the two of them knew more than they were lettin' on. Tell Karnik what's happened to Hammertoe and give him the amulet--he'll tell you what needs to be done next. "
1860,Study of the Elements: Rock,Bring 3 Large Stone Slabs to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands. ,"<name>, you've already proven more able than all my apprentices combined. The next parts I need require a little more strength. Large stone slabs can be found on rock elementals if you're careful enough. Their bodies are stronger and larger, and therefore more prone to having pieces large enough for my tests. You can find them further west of here or southeast along the mountains' edges. Take your time; I'll need a while to test these smaller pieces you brought me. "
1861,Passing Word of a Threat,Find Advisor Belgrum and give him his note. ,"<name>, run and find Advisor Belgrum as quickly as you can. Tell him what you've witnessed and ask him how he wants us to proceed. This note will explain more to him. In the meantime, I will take the time to speak to Hammertoe's spirit. Maybe he knows something that will help us put a stop to those Shadowforge cretins' activities in the Badlands. We can only pray. "
1862,Passing Word of a Threat,Speak to Historian Karnik. ,"< Advisor Belgrum reaches the end of the note, and his eyes widen for a moment. >Och, these are evil tidings. <name>, please return to Historian Karnik and tell him on the king's authority to act on this information swiftly and decisively.

I am an alchemist of some note, and I seek your aid in acquiring some reagents found out in the Badlands. I need the following items to replenish my stocks: five buzzard gizzards, ten crag coyote fangs, and five rock elemental shards.  Obviously, you can get them off of the beasties themselves; if you're not the fighting type, then find friends who are. Acquire these items for me, you'll get some coin out of the deal.  Watcha wanna do? "
1864,Study of the Elements: Rock,Find 10 Small Stone Shards and bring them to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands. ,"Here in the Badlands I've stopped to work on my latest project: my shackles of elemental binding. When complete, they will allow mages to summon even more powerful elementals for use in even greater capacities. To start things off, I need small stone shards to test some of my newest offensive spells along with a few gizmos I've pieced together. The shards are easily collected from the lesser rock elementals to the west of here. Could you bring me some? "
1865,Murdaloc,"Slay Agmond's killer, Murdaloc. ","Agmond's tracks lead from the west.  It is easy to tell from the bloody smears across rock and sand that the dwarf crawled some distance.

1866,A Dwarf and His Tools,Find Ryedol's Lucky Pick and return it to Prospector Ryedol south of Hammertoe's Dig Site. ,"Hey, <name>. Be careful 'round here. There be Dark Iron dwarves all around--looked like the Shadowforge clan. They just attacked the excavation site I was workin' at--killed nearly everyone there, including my boss Hammertoe. I barely escaped with me life. The site's just to the north of here, and I'm tryin' to plan a way to get some of our supplies back, especially me lucky pick. Think you'd be up to helpin' me out some? One of those damned Dark Iron must have my pick! Could be anyone of them. "
1867,The Rise of the Machines,Take the Elemental Shard Sample to Lotwil Veriatus. ,G. L. A. Those are the 'initials' imprinted on the elemental shards. Below the initials are a rank marking of some sort. The machinations you destroyed in the Burning Steppes were of 'Rank IV. ' I assume that this is a lowly rank. Take this shard sample to Lotwil Veriatus in the camp to the east. He is a scholar of some renown in the field of elemental sciences. He may be able to assist us in our search.

1870,The Black Box,Take the Corroded Black Box to the Hall of Arms in Ironforge. ,"The surface of this metallic black box is heavily pitted, as if it had been immersed in acid - it must have been sitting in the giant condor's stomach for a long time.

1871,Badlands Reagent Run II,Use the empty thaumaturgy vessels on scorched guardian dragons found in the Badlands. ,"You have been most helpful to me, <class>.  I would reward you with the very recipe for the brew I gave you earlier. . . but I would ask of you a task that is quite dangerous.  Hear my request. This lockbox contains three empty thaumaturgy vessels; they are imbued with an attunement aura that will drain the blood of a scorched guardian dragon.  Using one on the beast will anger it greatly, so be warned.  Once you have all three filled, bring them to me. Do this, and the recipe will be yours. "
1872,Report to Helgrum,Bring Neeka's Report to Helgrum the Swift in Stonard. ,"I wrote a fresh report for Helgrum in Stonard.  Bring it to him. And if you consider yourself an outrunner, then don't lose your way.  Or fall to an enemy. "

Have you faced the beasts that wander its dusty plains?  It's time you did. Crag coyotes are a tough breed.  Tough, and bold enough to creep into Kargath and steal from our food supplies.

The Dark Iron dwarves have summoned a foul spirit into our world that threatens to plague our lands with an eternal draught. This disharmony of flame must be investigated.

1876,Three Kings of Flame,"Gather the Incendicite of Incendius, the Ember of Emberseer and the Cinder of Cynders, along with a Hallowed Brazier, and return them to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain. ","In order to summon Lord Valthalak we're first going to need to gather the other two-thirds of the amulet. To do that we need to get a brazier and some special coals to burn in it. There are three nobles of fire, Lord Incedius in Blackrock Depths, Pyroguard Emberseer in Blackrock Spire and The Duke of Cynders in Silithus, with what we need. Collect from each a piece of their remains, and then return to me with a Hallowed Brazier, which can be purchased from the Argent Dawn if you are honored by them. "

1878,Return to Bodley,Return to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain and give him the Brazier of Beckoning. ,"I will ignore your impertinence this time, <class>, because you have done a noble thing today; returning the rest of my stolen spirit to me.

1882,Bodley's Unfortunate Fate,Travel to Blackrock Mountain and use the Extra-Dimensional Ghost Revealer to find Bodley near Blackrock Spire. ,"The medallion contained Valthalak's soul?  It's no surprise it was guarded by such a powerful curse. Locating Bodley presents a bit of a problem.  Last time I heard of him, he was preparing to venture back into Blackrock Spire.  He was never heard of again. Seek him out in Blackrock Mountain, though I'm afraid to say he's probably dead by now.  I suggest taking the goblin's device with you, friend. "

I have witnessed the black slayers and bonepickers feasting upon the corpse of many a fallen explorer - sometimes feeding upon the most vile and disease ridden of carcasses.

Impossible, improbable, and yet I have seen this demonstrated with my own eyes. Venture forth, into the Blasted Lands, and bring me three snickerfang jowls.

Well, the message wasn't really from Vectus. . . it was from someone named Leonid Barthalomew.  I don't know Leonid, but he knew my master, and no one knows my master unless he allows it. Leonid says Vectus wants the dragon eggs.  He wants you to deliver them to him at the Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands. That hurts!  Why you?  Doesn't Vectus trust me?

What we have found here, in their homeland, tells us another story.

1943,Digging Up the Past,Archmage Alturus wants you to go to the mountains south of Karazhan in Deadwind Pass and retrieve a Charred Bone Fragment. ,"Kamsis was right!

There is little room for error, so listen closely. The Burning Crystals - the green floating objects to the west of the Sunspire here - have long been used to power the isle's experimentations.  The mana wyrms were their guardians, but the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas has driven them errant from our lack of magical control over them. There is little choice but to thin their numbers for reclamation.  Do this, then return to me. "
2232,Old Whitebark's Pendant,Find the person who might have made Old Whitebark's Pendant. ,The pendant has the initials L. R. etched on to it.  Perhaps these letters will lead to the pendant's maker.

","Besides the constant threat that the Wretched represent, I also have to deal with all kind of fictitious reports of night elf sightings. Though most reports are unfounded, one recent incident demands further investigation.  The West Sanctum, one of our primary energy sources, has suffered a terrible malfunction and rumors of Darnassian sabotage are rampant. Travel there and deal with anyone that looks suspicious.  Report back to Ley-Keeper Velania, who watches over the sanctum. "

It's just down the road to the west. "
2235,Incriminating Documents,Bring the Incriminating Documents to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods. ,"The documents contain detailed maps of different strategic buildings in Eversong Woods.  A diagram of an arcane sanctum is also sketched in good detail.  There seem to be numerous notes in a language you don't recognize.

2236,Corrupted Soil,Apprentice Mirveda at the East Sanctum in Eversong Woods wants you to collect 8 Tainted Soil Samples. ,"This was a fully functional arcane sanctum before Arthas and his army of Scourge decided to plow through it on their way to Silvermoon. Now it's as useful to us as any part of the Dead Scar.  The soil is tainted, undead are drawn to it and the energy in the ley lines is completely disrupted. What I want to know, <name>, is whether this taint is reversible or not.  I want you to collect soil samples from this area so I can study them.  Perhaps with time we can set things back to normal. "

Could you retrieve my cargo? I can't expect that you'd be able to get all of it back, but I'll be grateful for any of it at this point. It was the Grimscale murlocs in the huts, just to the west and south of the anchorage on the Golden Strand, I'm sure of it! "
2238,Situation at Sunsail Anchorage,Kill 5 Wretched Thugs and 5 Wretched Hooligans and report to Ranger Degolien in Eversong Woods. ,"Sunsail Anchorage has been overrun by Wretched scum.

That doesn't prevent me from appreciating a fellow craftsman's work, <name>. I've come across pieces of Amani weaponry and I must admit I'm impressed by the quality of their work.  It is rumored that Spearcrafter Otembe wields a magical hammer that is so light and well-balanced it allows him to work with great dexterity and efficiency. If you bring me this tool I'll use it to craft you a weapon. "
2241,Fairbreeze Village,Speak to Ranger Degolien at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods. ,"I have another task for you, <name>. Ranger Degolien was sent to Fairbreeze Village to find out more about a Wretched attack on a nearby shipyard.  He has requested reinforcements which we cannot yet provide.

","If there is only one lesson you deign to remember from your time on Sunstrider Isle, let it be this - control your thirst for magic.  It is a thirst unending, <name> - what you absorb must be controlled and released via Arcane Torrent.  Failure is to become one of the Wretched. . . hopelessly addicted and insane. Seek out a mana wyrm and unleash your Arcane Torrent upon it.  Learn to master your power. When you have sufficiently released an Arcane Torrent, return to me. "
2243,Pelt Collection,Velan Brightoak at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods wants you to bring him 6 Springpaw Pelts. ,"The springpaw that inhabit this region are known for their high quality pelts.  We've even seen night elf scum travel to these lands just to poach them. Our skirmishes with the Amani have put a bit of a strain on our supply of gear and our rangers don't have much time to hunt for pelts anymore.  If you'd be willing to lend a hand by collecting springpaw pelts, I'd be happy to reward you with a hand-crafted piece of armor.  You'll find springpaw stalkers all around the woods north of here. "
2244,Warning Fairbreeze Village,Travel to Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods and speak to Ranger Degolien. ,"Go to Fairbreeze Village and notify Ranger Degolien of the Amani plans.

But let's not worry about that now.  I need to find my instructor's elemental grimoire. I'm certain I saw one of those cowards throw it into the river but I cannot seem to be able to locate it.  I could use another set of eyes.  I'll throw in a bit of coin if you spot it. 
2246,Wretched Ringleader,Bring Aldaron's Head to Velendris Whitemorn near Sunsail Anchorage in Eversong Woods. ,"The Wretched are so oblivious, gorging on foul magic, that they haven't realized we've recovered most of our weapons.

2247,Amani Encroachment,Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods wants you to kill 5 Amani Berserkers and 5 Amani Axe Throwers. ,"Ours are not the vast kingdoms of the humans and orcs.  All we have left of our lands in Azeroth lies mostly before your eyes, <name>. Until we can reach Outland, we must defend what little land we have at any cost. Our uncivilized neighbors to the southeast, the Amani trolls, certainly have a different opinion regarding the ownership of these lands.  Their daily raids are something we can't tolerate anymore.  Go to their settlements, Zeb'Watha and Tor'Watha, and teach them a lesson. "
2248,Swift Discipline,Use Antheol's Disciplinary Rod on his two students: Apprentice Ralen and Apprentice Meledor. ,"I hope you learn a valuable lesson today, <name>.

2250,Amani Invasion,Deliver the Amani Invasion Plans to Lieutenant Dawnrunner at Farstrider Retreat. ,"Though you don't understand the language in these battle plans, you clearly make out a map marking the positions of the Farstrider Retreat and Fairbreeze Village. You'd best let Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat know about this. "
2251,Tainted Arcane Sliver,Bring the Tainted Arcane Sliver to Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,You've found an odd sliver of crystallized mana on the corpse of the tainted arcane wraith.  The sliver is different than others you may have seen in that it is as dark and sinister-looking as the wraith you looted it from.  Just holding it gives you a sense of unnatural foreboding. Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle just might be someone who would have a use for the sliver. 
2252,Farstrider Retreat,Report to Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods. ,"Your help in subduing the Wretched has been invaluable.  The Farstriders would surely have use for someone like you in their fight against the Amani trolls. Look for the Farstrider Retreat to the northeast of here, speak to Lieutenant Dawnrunner and see what assistance she might need. "
2253,Well Watcher Solanian,Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"And now, I need for you to do something. Well Watcher Solanian is in need of your services.  You would do well to ingratiate yourself with him. He awaits you on the exterior platform that the ramp in this chamber leads up to. "
2254,A Fistful of Slivers,"Collect 6 Arcane Slivers from any creature on the isle that uses mana, and then return to Arcanist Ithanas on Sunstrider Isle. ","It's a shame that we've lost control of many of the creatures here on the island.  This was once a tranquil place of study and research.  Now it's all we can do to keep from being attacked by our own creations! I'm going to offer you a chance to receive a magical boon in exchange for some collecting work on your part.  Bring me a stack of arcane slivers that are found on the mana-using creatures of Sunstrider Isle, and I will cast a spell on you that should aid your adventures on the isle. "
2255,Zul'Marosh,"Ven'jashi, the troll prisoner at Tor'Watha, wants you to bring him Chieftain Zul'Marosh's Head. ","Come closer, mon.  Don't be 'fraid, Ven'jashi not gonna hurt you. Us Darkspears be mortal enemies of the Amani just like you.  Their boss Zul'Marosh is evil troll.  He give me the bad poison and leave me in this cage to die. I not scared of dyin', mon.  I seen death in the eye an' I laugh at her. I cannot die in peace yet, mon.  Not 'til Zul'Marosh be dead too.  You find him 'cross the lake in Zeb'Watha.  I hold this poison off 'til you bring me his big ugly head, mon.  Only then I die peacefully. "
2256,Whitebark's Memory,Larianna Riverwind wants you to place Old Whitebark's Pendant by the runestone at the Scorched Grove. ,"This pendant brings back memories of a different time.  A better time. Unfortunately, memories are the last thing I need right now. I want you to bury this by the runestone in the Scorched Grove.  It was there that I first met the treant elder.  Put my old friend's memory to rest. "
2257,A Somber Task,Slay 10 Withered Green Keepers at the Scorched Grove. ,"These are difficult times for us, <name>.  It was a very hard decision to burn the woods bordering the Ghostlands to prevent the Scourge's expansion. The treants, who have been our friends for years, are now trying to foster the regrowth of the forest along the Scorched Grove. This is a painful thing to ask of you, <class>, but we've failed to convince our former allies to cease their endeavors.  I need you to stop them by the only means that remain to us: force. "
2258,An Intact Converter,Bring the Intact Arcane Converter to Ley-Keeper Velania. ,"This object appears to be one of the arcane converters Ley-Keeper Velania mentioned.  It hasn't been damaged by the fire, perhaps she could find a use for it. "
2259,Roadside Ambush,Speak to Apprentice Meledor in Eversong Woods along the road heading south from Silvermoon City. ,"You, there!  You must help me, please! A fellow apprentice and I were attacked by the Wretched!  In their mad hunger for magic, they took everything they could get their hands on: mana crystals, wands, spellbooks. . . everything! Meledor gave chase after them; I had to stay behind and look after what they didn't take.  Continue down the road and see if you can lend him a hand. "
2260,Wanted: Thaelis the Hungerer,Bring Thaelis's Head to Sergeant Kan'ren at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods. ,"The city of Silvermoon hereby issues a reward for the head of Thaelis the Hungerer, notorious Wretched ringleader.  He is wanted for repeated crimes against the general populace of Silvermoon City, including the murder of two city guards. Report to Sergeant Kan'ren to collect the reward. "
2261,Research Notes,Deliver the Research Notes to Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods. ,"As discouraging as my research results are, they still contain valuable data.  I must have a magister review my work before it is taken seriously.  Please, take these notes to Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village, west of here. "
2262,Well Watcher Solanian,Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"And now, I need for you to do something. Well Watcher Solanian is in need of your services.  You would do well to ingratiate yourself with him. He awaits you on the exterior platform that the ramp in this chamber leads up to. "
2263,Unstable Mana Crystals,Bring back 6 Unstable Mana Crystals to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square. ,"A group of Wretched recently raided a supply of unstable mana crystals from one of our arcane sanctums.  If not handled properly, the crystals could explode with enough force to blow a hole into the city walls. Now, <name>, I don't quite care if they blow themselves up while tapping unstable arcane sources, but the whole incident would make my men look bad. Bring me back any remaining stolen crystals you find; they might still be inside their original crates. "
2264,Completing the Delivery,Deliver Erona's Package to Innkeeper Delaniel inside the inn at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods. ,"The death of another outrunner is a true tragedy, but it's a risk we all accept when we take the job.  Magistrix Erona at the Sunspire needs to get this package to the inn at Falconwing Square, and she needs it there as soon as possible. We're short handed and I don't have anyone else available that can cover for us. I'm not going to lie to you; the path to Falconwing Square can be extremely dangerous if you leave the safety of Dawning Lane.  Do you feel up to the task, <name>? "
2265,"Fish Heads, Fish Heads. . . ",Collect 8 Grimscale Murloc Heads. ,"Greetings, <class>.  Take a look toward the shore; what do you see?  That's right, our beach. . . our Tranquil Shore, has been infested with the malignancy known as the murloc. This blight will not stand! I have a task for you.  If you feel that you're up to it, I would have their heads!  Let us see if we can put a dent in their numbers so large that, if they have any sense at all, they will return to the murky depths from which they sprang! "
2266,Aiding the Outrunners,Speak with Outrunner Alarion near the bridge leading south of Sunstrider Isle. ,"Magistrix Erona wanted you to head over to Silvermoon City in order to aid our reclamation efforts there. . . that is, once you had successfully addressed the situation at Falthrien Academy.  You did not disappoint us, <name>. On your way to Falconwing Square, south of here, you should speak with Outrunner Alarion.  She's not far from the bridge. The Outrunners take care of shuttling goods between here and the mainland, and since you've proven to be so resourceful, they could use your assistance. "
2267,Major Malfunction,Collect 6 Arcane Cores from the Arcane Patrollers that roam the ruins of Silvermoon City and bring them to Magister Jaronis at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods. ,"The arcane patrollers crafted by our forefathers to protect the city have fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair.  They fail to recognize us as their masters and will attack us on sight! Even though they were created many years ago, the arcane cores that power them are still quite useful and valuable to us.  I want you to gather these cores and bring them to me so I can put them to good use again.  You will find the patrollers in the ruined section of Silvermoon, to the northwest. "
2268,Ranger Sareyn,Report to Ranger Sareyn outside Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods. ,Don't take the safety of this village for granted.  We're under siege by the Scourge on the east and the Wretched to the west. Ranger Sareyn keeps our borders safe from the undead that pour in from the Dead Scar.  Follow the road eastwards out of town and see if you can lend her a hand. 
2269,Lost Armaments,Bring 8 Sin'dorei Armaments to Velendris Whitemorn in Eversong Woods. ,"The Wretched grow bolder every day, <name>.  They've achieved enough coordination to launch an attack on Sunsail Anchorage. As if that weren't embarrassing enough, most of our weapons were left behind when they attacked.  Bring me back our armaments so that we may show those ruffians who's boss. "
2270,Delivery to the North Sanctum,Deliver the Unmarked Letter to Ley-Keeper Caidanis at the North Sanctum in Eversong Woods. ,"I'm pleased to discover that you're at least somewhat competent, <name>.  I'll give you another task since you seem so eager to prove yourself. This is a letter to Ley-Keeper Caidanis, the arcanist in charge of the upkeep of the North Sanctum.  Go southwest of Falconwing Square  and you will find him.  He is a very important person, so I hope you don't bother him too much with trivial chatter. "
2271,Malfunction at the West Sanctum,Speak to Ley-Keeper Velania at the West Sanctum in Eversong Woods. ,"Since you're here, <name>, I've a favor to ask you. Ley-Keeper Velania 's apprentice dropped by earlier to ask for assistance.  Apparently there's some malfunction happening at the West Sanctum.  I've been a bit busy entertaining our. . . most pleasant. . . dwarven guest.  See if you can give her a hand.  You'll find the West Sanctum southwest of here. "
2272,The Shrine of Dath'Remar,Read the plaque on the Shrine of Dath'Remar and then return to Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"Day after day I stand here, watching, waiting.  I've been accused of dwelling too much on our past, while my eyes look to the horizon.  But it is my firm belief that each visitor to this island should honor those who have sacrificed all so that they may continue to do so. Dath'Remar Sunstrider was our first king.  He led us here from Kalimdor through the Maelstrom. Seek out his shrine to the west and do not return to me until you have read the plaque upon it in his honor. "
2273,Slain by the Wretched,Go south into the ruins of Silvermoon and look for the Slain Outrunner in Dawning Lane. ,"It's hard work being an outrunner between Sunstrider Isle and Falconwing Square.  Tight deadlines, long hours and worst of all. . . the Wretched! The road south goes through the ruins of Silvermoon. . . the place is crawling with Wretched ready to kill you for a few mana crystals.  Unfortunately, I think that's what happened to the last outrunner we sent with one of Erona's packages. I see you're eager to prove yourself.  Venture into Dawning Lane and see if you can find any traces of our outrunner. "
2274,Well Watcher Solanian,Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"And now, I need for you to do something. Well Watcher Solanian is in need of your services.  You would do well to ingratiate yourself with him. He awaits you on the exterior platform that the ramp in this chamber leads up to. "
2275,Runewarden Deryan,"Speak to Runewarden Deryan in Eversong Woods, near the border with the Ghostlands. ","This increase in Scourge attacks leads me to believe there might be a malfunction at one of the protective runestones at the border with the Ghostlands. We used these ancient stones to protect us against the undead.  Most of them were destroyed or lost after the attack on the Sunwell. Follow the road south, towards the Ghostlands, and look to the west for a small path.  You will find Runewarden Deryan by the runestone nearby; he will know whether anything's wrong. "
2276,The Scorched Grove,Find Larianna Riverwind near the Scorched Grove in the southwest of Eversong Woods. ,"A foul taint in the soil precedes the expansion of the Scourge into a new area.  The protective runestones along the border with the Ghostlands have warded the land against this taint in the past. The westernmost runestone was destroyed during a Scourge attack, which forced us to burn the ground around it to prevent the taint from spreading. My sister, Larianna Riverwind, watches over the Scorched Grove.  Go find her; she might have some work for you. "
2277,Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters,Return Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters to Captain Kelisendra at the defended camp just to the east of the Sunsail Anchorage in Eversong Woods. ,"Interesting. . . what you have found here is a water-proofed, leather tube containing a number of sheets of parchment. By the markings upon them, the pages are clearly navigation rutters, and each bears the signature of one Captain Kelisendra. You've heard of a small, defended camp just east of the nearby Sunsail Anchorage. Maybe the captain is there? "
2278,Abandoned Investigations,Return Magister Duskwither's Journal to Magister Duskwither at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods. ,"You have discovered what appears to be an investigative journal left behind by Magister Duskwither. A brief scan of its contents reveal some shocking attempts at filtering corrupted magical flows, which might explain what has happened here at Duskwither Spire. The magister is sure to want this brought back to him. "
2279,Unfortunate Measures,Collect 8 Lynx Collars from slain Springpaw Lynxes and Springpaw Cubs. ,"Your effort has made something clear that, honestly, I wish were not true.  The unchecked power of the Burning Crystals has maligned a much larger swath of the isle's natural balance than I thought.  We must now take on more unfortunate measures to reclaim control. The nearby lynxes have succumbed to the influence of the crystals, and they must be put down.  Bring their collars, <name>, as I may yet be able to fashion a magical restraint to turn some back from being uncontrolled. "
2280,Taking the Fall,Bring Antheol's Elemental Grimoire to Instructor Antheol at Stillwhisper Pond in Eversong Woods. ,"Antheol is going to fly off his rocker when he finds out his book is ruined.  I've got a little proposal for you; don't worry, I'll make it worth your while. Take this book to him and tell him nothing of this incident.  If he asks, just tell him you dropped the book into a puddle.  He has no direct authority over you, so there's not much he can do. Antheol delivers his lectures at Stillwhisper Pond, southeast of Silvermoon.  You'll do this for us, right?  I'll reward you handsomely for this favor! "
2281,Report to Aeldon Sunbrand,Report to Aeldon Sunbrand at the Inner Elf Gate in Eversong Woods. ,"If you're looking for work, you'll find Captain Sunbrand inside the Inner Elf Gate, through the doors behind me. Now leave me be, I must question this scoundrel. "
2282,Aggression,"Kill 7 Tenders and 7 Feral Tenders, and then return to Lanthan Perilon on Sunstrider Isle. ","Before sending you to the Academy, I want you on another task that needs to be dealt with immediately.  Once used to aid us in the gardening of Sunstrider Isle, the bestial tenders now have grown out of our control.  Clear them out with due haste, but be warned - their lack of control has made them aggressive.  It is such aggression that forces us to put down these once-gentle servants. It doesn't please me to ask you to do such a task, but survival is survival.  I'll mourn later. "
2283,Arcane Instability,Ley-Keeper Velania wants you to kill 5 Manawraiths and 5 Mana Stalkers. ,"It's about time that dimwit, Caidanis, sent someone this way. I warned of the dangers of increasing the load on the West Sanctum!  Now one of our energy converters is destroyed and arcane wraiths are pouring out of the sanctum! I'm going to need you to take care of these creatures before we send anyone in for repairs.  Make haste! "
2284,Cleaning up the Grounds,Kill 6 Mana Serpents and 6 Ether Fiends and return to Groundskeeper Wyllithen at Duskwither Grounds in Eversong Woods. ,"It's horrible, I tell you! Strange things happening in the spire, the magister and his apprentices run off, and then the next thing that you know, the whole grounds are overrun with these magical beasties! And who told Wyllithen? No one, that's who! <class>, you've got to help me clear some of these things out. . . I cannot maintain the grounds while these 'anomalies' are running amok! "
2285,The Magister's Apprentice,Speak with Apprentice Loralthalis near Duskwither Spire in Eversong Woods. ,"<class>, hear my request. For reasons that I cannot go into now, I decided to shut down my nearby school. A few days ago, I sent one of my pupils, Apprentice Loralthalis, there with this very task. I have not heard back from her since. Will you go to Duskwither Spire and check in on her, to make sure that she is well? You'll find it by heading north on the path out of Farstrider Retreat, then go to the right when the road branches. "
2286,Unexpected Results,Protect Apprentice Mirveda from the Scourge ambush. ,"Something's wrong, <name>.  I sense the presence of Scourge.  Be ready to fight them! "
2287,Defending Fairbreeze Village,Slay 4 Rotlimb Marauders and 4 Darkwraiths and return to Ranger Sareyn at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods. ,"We've experienced a marked increase in Scourge attacks, <name>.  Our defenses are barely holding and there's no sign of reinforcements from Silvermoon City.  Lend us a hand in defending the village by thinning the numbers of the undead roaming the Dead Scar nearby. "
2288,Where's Wyllithen? ,Find Groundskeeper Wyllithen on the Duskwither Grounds in Eversong Woods. ,"The Duskwither groundskeeper has gone missing! Someone must have forgotten to tell him to leave when the magister and everyone else did.  I know that he's still somewhere around here on the grounds, but I dare not go looking for him myself with all of these magical creatures roaming about. Will you find him for me, <class>, and make sure that he's alright? "
2289,Well Watcher Solanian,Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"And now, I need for you to do something. Well Watcher Solanian is in need of your services.  You would do well to ingratiate yourself with him. He awaits you on the exterior platform that the ramp in this chamber leads up to. "
2290,Well Watcher Solanian,Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"And now, I need for you to do something. Well Watcher Solanian is in need of your services.  You would do well to ingratiate yourself with him. He awaits you on the exterior platform that the ramp in this chamber leads up to. "
2291,Felendren the Banished,"Kill 8 Arcane Wraiths and 2 Tainted Arcane Wraiths, as well as Felendren the Banished; they are located in the Falthrien Academy. ","A betrayer of our people resides atop Falthrien Academy to the southwest. Felendren is his name, and he was banished from blood elf lands for failing to heed the warnings of our teachers and elders.  He is the worst of our society, as he lives only to feed his insatiable magical addictions.  He refused to learn control; he is a shell of his former self - one of the Wretched - and he is a threat to the Sunspire. Destroy him and the wraiths he uses as minions. "
2292,Package Recovery,Return to Outrunner Alarion with Erona's Package. ,You take the package and confirm that indeed it comes from Magistrix Erona.  Alarion would probably want you to bring it to her. 
2293,Well Watcher Solanian,Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"And now, I need for you to do something. Well Watcher Solanian is in need of your services.  You would do well to ingratiate yourself with him. He awaits you on the exterior platform that the ramp in this chamber leads up to. "
2294,Report to Lanthan Perilon,Speak with Lanthan Perilon on Sunstrider Isle; he is standing close to the path running west away from the Sunspire. ,"You are to report to my assistant, Lanthan Perilon.  He will instruct you on what needs to be done next.  While we here at the Sunspire will continue to rein in the Burning Crystals, you will be focused on a more pressing matter concerning Falthrien Academy.  Lanthan will explain fully when you speak to him. Simply walk west of here along the path, and you should see him standing close by. Good luck, <name> - your continued successes shall be rewarded. "
2295,The Dwarven Spy,Find and kill Prospector Anvilward in the North Sanctum and report back to Aeldon Sunbrand in Eversong Woods. ,"Are you sure you found these notes on a Night Elf, then?  Most of them are written in the Dwarven. . . Prospector Anvilward!  He was sent here from Ironforge on a diplomatic mission.  I should've known his interest in our Arcane Sanctums was a bit excessive.  <name>, find the dwarf in the North Sanctum and take care of him.  Oh, and be discrete about it. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(8896))"
2296,Solanian's Belongings,"Collect Well Watcher Solanian's Scrying Orb, his Scroll of Scourge Magic, and his Journal. ","With all the chaos happening here at the Sunspire, I haven't had a chance to collect my belongings I've left outside at various places on the isle.  I must maintain my vigil over the Sunwell here, so I'll ask you to collect them in my stead. I need my scrying orb, my scroll of Scourge magic, and my journal.  Use this satchel for some extra space, as my things are rather bulky.  Return them to me and I'll give you a little something - you know, for the effort; you can keep the satchel as well! "
2297,Spinal Dust,Bring back 10 Spinal Dusts to Magistrix Aminel in Tranquillien. ,"The dark energy that flows through the bodies of reanimated skeletons tends to accumulate primarily in their spine.  I've discovered a method of instilling this energy into a potion that boosts our magical abilities against the undead. Bring me some spinal dust and I'll be glad to provide you with a sample.  You'll find an ample number of skeletons wandering the Dead Scar, west of here. "
2298,Rotting Hearts,Bring back 10 Rotting Hearts to Magistrix Aminel in Tranquillien. ,"I hear the Amani trolls eat their enemies' hearts to steal their strength.  They might just be on to something, <name>.  With the proper treatment, the hearts of the unliving can produce potent elixirs. Hunt down the zombies that roam the Dead Scar and bring me their hearts.  I'll show you the kind of enhancement we can perform to your physical prowess against the undead. "
2299,The Traitor's Destruction,Slay Dar'Khan Drathir inside Deatholme and bring his head to Magister Kaendris at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands. ,"Everything we've done in the Ghostlands has been done with the goal of taking back what is rightfully ours.  The Scourge have maintained their chokehold on the region for far too long. The time has come for payback, <name>.  Thanks to your help and the help of our new allies, the Forsaken, vengeance will soon be ours. He who sought to steal the power of the Sunwell must die.  Go to Deatholme, the Scourge stronghold south of the Dead Scar.  Bring me Dar'Khan's head and your deeds will go down in history! "
2300,More Rotting Hearts,"You've brought more ghoul hearts? &nbsp; I can use as many as you can collect, &lt; name&gt; . ","This will provide you with greater power against the Scourge.   Bring more hearts if you find them, <name>. "

2302,Dar'Khan's Lieutenants,"Magister Idonis wants you to venture into Deatholme to slay Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter and Mirdoran the Fallen. ","The odious traitor, Dar'Khan, has risen to great power among the ranks of the Scourge.  His lieutenants command vast armies of undead against our dwindling numbers. Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter, Mirdoran the Fallen.  Learn these names well for in the Ghostlands these Scourge leaders are second only to Dar'Khan himself.  Slay them and their mindless armies will be thrown into disarray. "
2303,Wanted: Knucklerot and Luzran,Search the Ghostlands for Knucklerot and Luzran. ,A bounty is hereby declared for the abominations known as Knucklerot and Luzran.

Individuals seeking to claim the reward must present the abominations' heads to Deathstalker Rathiel as proof of the deed. 
2304,Troll Juju,Collect 8 Troll Juju and return them to Deathstalker Maltendis at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"The corpses of trolls buried inside the Amani Catacombs have been rising from the dead! I want you to go there and bring back proof of their final demise. Some of these mummy trolls, and their living counterparts, carry juju; glowing objects that house an unknown power source.  It's probably what is animating them! The catacombs lie within Sungraze Peak, directly to the east. I am told that the easiest way in lies on the north face of the mountain. See to it, <class>! "
2305,Hero of the Sin'dorei,Take Dar'Khan's Head to Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City. ,"This is the beginning of a new chapter in the history of our race, <name>.

2306,The Farstrider Enclave,"Magister Kaendris, at the Sanctum of the Sun, wants you to talk to Ranger Vynna at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands. ","Magisters and Farstriders may not see eye to eye all the time, <name>.  When it comes to Dar'Khan, however, we're all in agreement that a way must be found to defeat him and his legions.

2307,Investigate An'daroth,"Investigate the area at An'daroth, kill 12 Sentinel Spies and then return to Dame Auriferous at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ","<class>, we are having difficulty with a group of night elves that have recently taken over a nearby island. They've set up a small camp at the old high elf ley-line nexus, An'daroth, to the northwest. There is a dirt path that leads up to it just past the Dead Scar. I suggest that you lend us your aid by going there, investigating what they are up to, and slaying as many of the conceited night elves as you can. "
2308,The Twin Ziggurats,Travel to the Bleeding Ziggurat and the Howling Ziggurat and recover the Stone of Light and the Stone of Flame. ,"According to this journal, Dar'Khan promised the Scourge two powerful elven artifacts: the stone of light and the stone of flame.  These were imbued with the magical energies of the Sunwell and attuned to have warding powers against the Scourge. The crystals were to be transported to where the Howling Ziggurat and the Bleeding Ziggurat now stand, in the middle of the Dead Scar.  If they're still held there, we need to recover them.  Their power will be greatly useful in our struggle against the enemy. "
2309,Anok'suten,Slay Anok'suten and return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"Come closer, I am. . . dying. I was sent here. . . to slay these Nerubians, but Vandril didn't. . . know that they have a leader. <The dying blood elf coughs up a good amount of blood. >You must find and. . . slay Anok'suten.

2311,Help Ranger Valanna! ,Find Ranger Valanna and Lieutenant Tomathren on the shore of Lake Elrendar in the Ghostlands near Suncrown Village. ,"<class>, I can't just sit here waiting for an audience with the high executor or Dame Auriferous! This cannot wait! We were dealing with the Shadowpine trolls of Zeb'Sora to the northeast across Lake Elrendar. But the lieutenant mishandled the attack and we lost a lot of Farstriders. Then he just fell to pieces afterward. Ranger Valanna sent me here, and Ranger Salissa to the Farstrider Enclave for help. Please find them, <class>. Valanna was badly injured and the lieutenant's useless. "
2312,Down the Dead Scar,Slay 10 Risen Hungerers and 10 Gangled Cannibals on the Dead Scar. ,If you've made it this far then you probably know about the Dead Scar and how to this day mindless Scourge follow the path of destruction that Arthas created on his way to Silvermoon City.

","Now, the more direct course of action that we are going to take, to figure out what these night elves are really up to, is to have you go to their island and steal any information that you can come by. I want you to head west down the road out of town to Shalandis Isle, just off the coast. Go there and recover any plans they might have on the island or on their ship. "
2314,Bring Me Kel'gash's Head! ,Return the Head of Kel'gash the Wicked to Captain Helios at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands. ,"WANTED: Bring the head of Kel'gash the Wicked, chieftain of the Shadowpine trolls, to Captain Helios. No questions asked. Kel'gash is known to dwell somewhere to the south in Zeb'Nowa. REWARD: Yes, but no advances! "
2315,The Fallen Courier,Apothecary Thedra in Eversong Woods wants you to bring her 4 Plagued Blood Samples from beasts in the Ghostlands. ,"What are you standing around for?  Can't you see this boy needs immediate attention?  By the looks of it, the plague is beginning to take over his body.  Within minutes not even a master apothecary like me will be able to save him. The animals south of the river all carry the plague in their blood.  Go across the bridge and hunt the plagued beasts there.  Bring me enough plagued blood samples and I'll distill a serum capable of saving this blood elf.  Hurry! "
2316,Deliver the Plans to An'telas,Deliver the Night Elf Plans to Magister Sylastor at An'telas in the Ghostlands. ,"You must deliver the recovered night elf plans to An'telas for me. It is to the east, on the southern slopes of Sungraze Peak, just to the northeast of the Sanctum of the Sun. Magister Sylastor is there conducting ongoing studies into the ley-line nexus energy for potential use in our fight against the Scourge. Have him look at these plans to shed some light on what it is that these night elves are up to. "
2317,Deactivate An'owyn,Retrieve the Crystal Controlling Orb and then use it to deactivate the Night Elf Moon Crystal at An'owyn. ,"Their moon crystals are scrying devices -- they're going to spy on us! I know that An'daroth can't provide enough power for that, but An'owyn, directly to the south, most definitely can! From the plans I now have a basic knowledge of how these moon crystals work; enough to shut them down. They're keyed so that they can be turned off. You must go to An'owyn, retrieve the controlling orb from one of the night elves and then use it on the moon crystal to stop them from enacting their plan! Hurry, <class>! "
2318,Escape from the Catacombs,Escort Ranger Lilatha to Captain Helios at Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands. ,"These trolls ambushed me and have been keeping me in this cage.  I think they're planning to sacrifice me!  Help me get out of here! The lock on the cage isn't that complex. . . I just can't get to it from this side.  Please escort me back to the Farstrider Enclave.  I'm sure Captain Helios will reward you, and you'll have my undying gratitude! "
2319,Windrunner Village,Gather 6 Phantasmal Substance and 4 Gargoyle Fragments. ,"<name>, the final battle against the Ghostlands villages is upon you. Windrunner Village to the southwest has been overrun by a large force of the more powerful Scourge shocktroopers; shades and gargoyles. You will be the spearpoint of our offensive by thinning out their numbers. The magisters at the nearby Sanctum of the Sun have made a special request this time; they want the remains from these Scourge to study in hopes of finding creative ways of fighting them. Good hunting! "
2320,Trouble at the Underlight Mines,"Slay 8 Blackpaw Gnolls, 6 Blackpaw Scavengers and 4 Blackpaw Shaman, and return to Deathstalker Maltendis at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ",The Underlight Mines to the southwest have been overrun by a clan of gnolls calling themselves the Blackpaw. I don't need to remind you how important those mines are to us as a strategic asset in our ongoing campaign here in the Ghostlands! Take the south road out of town and follow the fork to the right. Just past the ziggurat on the right there will be a short dirt path to the west. Follow it. The ore must flow! 
2321,Goldenmist Village,"Defeat 6 Quel'dorei Ghosts and 4 Quel'dorei Wraiths at Goldenmist Village, and then return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ","We've had one success, but there are two more villages that must be reclaimed! Goldenmist Village is our next target. It lies to the northwest, and has been taken by the ghosts of the high elves that used to live there. Gruesome, I know, but these are apparently the sorts of tactics that the Scourge like to employ. Go and defeat these ghosts and wraiths, <class>. Take the west road out of Tranquillien to get there. "
2322,Curbing the Plague,Farstrider Sedina at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands wants you to slay 8 Spindleweb Lurkers and 10 Vampiric Mistbats. ,"You've proven your worth as an ally, <name>.  I need you to continue your task and track down more plagued wildlife.  This time seek out some of the more dangerous beasts.  Hunt the spindleweb lurkers west of the Dead Scar and the vampiric mistbats just south of here.  Return to me when you're done. "
2323,Bearers of the Plague,Farstrider Sedina at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands wants you to slay 10 Ghostclaw Lynxes. ,"You show courage coming to the Ghostlands, <name>.  There is much work to be done here and not enough brave souls to do it. I've a thankless task to offer you, should you have the inclination to aid our cause.  The very wildlife in this land has been tainted by the plague and we must stop it from spreading.  Hunt the ghostclaw lynxes to the east and south of here and return when you've slain enough of them. "
2324,Captives at Deatholme,"Take Renzithen's Restorative Draught to Deatholme and rescue Apprentice Varnis,  Apothecary Enith and Ranger Vedoran. ","Ah, yes.  One of my finest creations.  This draught will break most forms of alchemically induced stupor. Side effects include confusion, nausea and - in rare cases - temporary blindness.  All much preferable to whatever the Scourge plans to do to those prisoners in Deatholme, if you ask me. Best of luck, brave <class>.  You are going to need it. "
2325,Clearing the Way,Apprentice Vor'el at Andilien Estate in the Ghostlands wants you to slay 10 Greater Spindlewebs and 10 Ghostclaw Ravagers. ,"Magister Kaendris sent me down here to clear the area of any hostile wildlife.  Once this area is secured, the magisters plan to turn it into some sort of advance outpost against the Scourge. Now if there's one thing I've learned as an apprentice it's to delegate responsibility - especially in matters that endanger one's life! If you're interested, I'll pay you well to kill the greater spindlewebs and ghostclaw ravagers to the west and south of here. "
2326,Tomber's Supplies,Retrieve Rathis Tomber's Supplies and return it to him at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"How am I supposed to supply the war effort when I cannot even safely get my supplies here? I was promised an escort that never came. And then, I had to leave one of my carts behind to the west when I was attacked by a band of ghouls! Want to help out, and get me open for business in the process? Go down the western road out of town and past the graveyard. On the other side of the Dead Scar is a fork in the road. The hill that my cart had to be left on lies just beyond. "
2327,Culinary Crunch,Collect 5 Crunchy Spider Legs and return them to Master Chef Mouldier at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"This is intolerable!  I have nothing to work with here! Milady asks me to come from Silvermoon City; she deserves cuisine as befits her station.  No?  But I get here and there is no food.  You must go out, <class>, and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare. Dame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food.  There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar.  Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with. "
2328,Dealing with Zeb'Sora,Collect 6 Zeb'Sora Troll Ears and return them to Ranger Valanna in the Ghostlands. ,"The lieutenant here rushed us into battle with the trolls across the lake instead of scouting the situation first. We were decimated by his stupidity! You hear me Tomathren? You're an idiot! Will you help us, <class>? Those trolls still need to be dealt with. I need to stay here and nursemaid him -- I think he's lost his mind. Just head east to the other side of the lake into Zeb'Sora. I want revenge. . . bring me their ears so that I can fashion a nice necklace! "
2329,Retaking Windrunner Spire,"Slay 8 Deatholme Acolytes and 10 Fallen Rangers, and return to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ","<class>, I want you to reclaim Windrunner Spire! It's an honor, really. Windrunner Spire is the original home of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, queen of the Forsaken and former ranger-general of the elves. But now it's been overrun by the mindless Scourge. To get there take the road south until it branches. Take the right fork and after crossing the Dead Scar continue southwest. You can't miss it. "
2330,Missing in the Ghostlands,Follow the road out of Fairbreeze Village towards the south and look for Courier Dawnstrider as you approach the Ghostlands. ,"My nephew was sent into the Ghostlands a few days ago.  He never mentioned anything about his task, except that it was of an extremely secret nature. He never returned and I fear for the worst, <class>.  A missing messenger might not mean much to the callous magisters of Silvermoon, but he's like a son to me.  Please, <name>, will you look for him? "
2331,Delivery to Tranquillien,Bring the Letter from Silvermoon to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"I. . . I'm too weak to continue.  I carry a dire warning from Regent Lord Theron, in the form of a letter.  You'll have to deliver it for me. Take it to Arcanist Vandril in Tranquillien.  You'll find the town further to the south along this road.  Go there and. . . find Vandril. . . "
2332,Hints of the Past,Return to Ranger Vynna at the Farstrider Enclave with Dar'Khan's Journal. ,As you skim through the pages in the journal you're overcome by an unnerving sense of being watched. The contents are unsettling.  Dar'Khan's soul was one filled with hatred and contempt for his own people.  The extent of his machinations and plots are all documented in great detail. Perhaps there is something here that Vynna will find useful. 
2333,The Traitor's Shadow,Travel to Dawnstar Spire in the Ghostlands and search for any clues involving Dar'Khan's past. ,"Dar'Khan Drathir is believed to have returned from the dead to rule over the armies of the Scourge in the Ghostlands.  Dar'Khan aligned himself with the Scourge long ago. . . yet he was once a living, breathing elf.  Much of his time was spent inside Dawnstar Spire, northeast of here.  He hid there for many nights, scheming against his own. Search the tower for more information, <name>.  Perhaps he had a journal or kept notes.  One never knows where useful information might present itself. "
2334,Undercover Sister,Report to Donna Brascoe to collect a reward for your heroism in Zul'Aman. ,"<Donna looks around and then whispers to you. ><name>, what I'm about to tell you must remain confidential, understood? I've been sent by the Shattrath Peacekeepers to infiltrate Budd's gang here. Truth be told, since you first arrived you've been a key person of interest in my investigation. But your deeds have since cleared you of any suspicion. In fact, for your slaying of the crazed warlord, Zul'Jin, I'm compelled to reward you for your efforts. "
2335,Report to Captain Helios,Speak with Captain Helios at the Farstrider Enclave on the southern shore of Lake Elrendar in the Ghostlands. ,"I need one last favor of you, <class>.  Just in case Ranger Salissa didn't make it back to Farstrider Enclave on the south edge of the lake, I need you to go there and get help. Just check in with Captain Helios and let him know what's happened here.  I'm sure he'll send help back as soon as he can. "
2336,A Restorative Draught,Speak to Apothecary Renzithen in Tranquillien. ,The battle against the Scourge is not one without casualties.  Many are slain every day yet many more meet a worse fate. It is not uncommon for the Scourge to take prisoners.  Death would be preferable to what awaits them in Deatholme.  They're interrogated and tortured while under the effects of horrible will-breaking poisons. Apothecary Renzithen in Tranquillien has developed a remedy; go to him and retrieve this restorative draught. 
2337,Report to Magister Kaendris,Bring Dar'Khan's Journal to Magister Kaendris at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands. ,"The magisters at the Sanctum of the Sun have made great progress in analyzing the Scourge's weaknesses with the aid of the Forsaken. Magister Kaendris will know what to do with this information. You'll find the Sanctum of the Sun southwest of here.  You must hurry, <name>.  Dar'Khan is a cunning enemy and watches our every move! "
2338,The Sanctum of the Sun,Speak to Magister Idonis in the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands. ,"You've proven your loyalty to Tranquillien and have helped us defend it against the threat of the Scourge.  Some of our most powerful magisters have come from Silvermoon to help us take the fight to the enemy's doorstep. They've rebuilt the arcane sanctum to the south and have driven the Scourge away from the surrounding area.  They plan to launch an offensive into Deatholme, Dar'Khan's stronghold.  You would do well to join them, <name>.  I'm sure they can make use of a seasoned <class> like yourself. "
2339,Investigate the Amani Catacombs,"Investigate the Amani Catacombs and burn 10 Mummified Troll Remains, then return to Advisor Valwyn at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ","<class>, our sources tell us that the trolls buried in the Amani Catacombs inside Sungraze Peak have been rising from the dead. Dame Auriferous would have you investigate these catacombs and put to the torch any of the unanimated remains you come across so as to prevent any more of these creatures from rising. The fastest way there is to head north out of town and then take the first fork to the right. This will put you on the north side of the peak, so look to the south for the entrance. "
2340,A Little Dash of Seasoning,Poison the Troll foodstuff at the camps in Zeb'Nowa and then return to Apothecary Venustus at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands. ,"I'm on loan to the Farstriders in an attempt to help with their troll difficulties. I believe that I have a solution to their problem. At my disposal are a number of potent poisons. The trolls, as you know, are living creatures and therefore must eat. If we combine my poison with their food. . . well, I'm sure that the results will be entertaining! Care to help rid us of the Shadowpine trolls at Zeb'Nowa to the south? The camp straddles both the north and south sides of the road to Zul'Aman. "
2341,War on Deatholme,"Slay 5 Eyes of Dar'khan, 6 Nerubis Centurions and 6 Wailers in Deatholme and return to Magister Idonis at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands. ",If you seek to aid our cause there is no better place to start than here and no better time to do it than now. By rebuilding the Sanctum of the Sun we've raised a banner of defiance in front of our enemy's seat of power: Deatholme. Go forth and fight the hordes of undead that inhabit the vile Scourge fortress. 
2342,Suncrown Village,Slay 10 Nerubis Guards and then return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"We're surrounded here, <class>.  The outlying villages have all been overrun by the Scourge! You must head northeast to Suncrown Village immediately and deal with the Nerubian Scourge menace.  You can't miss them - they're spider-like creatures. There's no time to waste. . . . Quel'Thalas must be reclaimed! "
2343,Attack on Zeb'Tela,"Kill 8 Shadowpine Shadowcasters and 8 Shadowpine Headhunters, and return to Farstrider Solanna at Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands. ","Our resources are spread pretty thin here, <class>, so your help is going to be invaluable.  The captain has tasked me with overseeing the harassment of the local Shadowpine troll camps. We have a policy of keeping them off balance until the day when we can launch a brutal offensive to wipe them out. Until then, we need all of the volunteers that we can get so that those Shadowpine troll numbers are decreased. Think you could head east to Zeb'Tela and hurt them a little? "
2344,Skymistress Gloaming,Bring Quartermaster Lymel's Goods to Skymistress Gloaming just outside Silvermoon City's Shepherd's Gate. ,"It doesn't look as if you have a cart or a beast of burden with you, so I'd better send you back only with what you can carry.  If you've spoken with Skymaster Sunwing at Tranquillien, then you should get this to Quartermaster Lymel as soon as possible by flying back. Take these goods for final inspection to Skymistress Gloaming just outside Silvermoon City's Shepherd's Gate. "
2345,Spirits of the Drowned,"Ranger Krenn'an, at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands, wants you to kill 8 Vengeful Apparitions and 8 Ravening Apparitions in the nearby lake. ","The lake to the north has been haunted by the ghosts of my ancestors for as long as I can remember, <name>.  The poor souls were victims of a tragic incident in which scores of them drowned at the bottom of the lake. The details of the event are mostly forgotten, but their haunting cries serve as a constant reminder of their curse. If you're up to the task, I want you to go to the lake and put an end to their suffering, <name>.  You will have my gratitude as well as theirs. . . I'm sure. "
2346,Heart of Deatholme,Destroy 8 Eyes of Dar'Khan and report back to Magister Idonis at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands. ,"Deep inside Deatholme our enemies are striving to create stronger, deadlier spectral soldiers.  These abhorrent creatures are perfect killing machines, handcrafted by Dar'Khan himself and hardened by the dark magic of Deatholme. Travel to the Tower of the Damned inside Deatholme and destroy them, <name>.  We cannot let our enemy's army grow in power while we struggle to maintain our foothold in the Ghostlands. "
2347,Assault on Zeb'Nowa,"Kill 10 Shadowpine Catlords and 10 Shadowpine Hexxers, and return to Farstrider Solanna at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands. ","Time for something a little more challenging. Zeb'Nowa, to the south, is where the more powerful Shadowpine trolls make their home. In our continuing effort to keep the troll numbers to a minimum I'm dispatching you to go down there and assail them by whatever means you have at your disposal. What do you say, <name>? Ready to deal with some more trolls? "
2348,The Lady's Necklace,Take The Lady's Necklace to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"The necklace shimmers, a remarkable piece of jewelry that doesn't seem to succumb to the gloom that permeates the Ghostlands. Given the inscription, and where you found it, it must be the lost property of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner herself! Perhaps it would be best to first take it to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien? He seems to be the highest ranking Forsaken in the area and is sure to know what to do with it. "
2349,Vanquishing Aquantion,Geranis Whitemorn wants you to swim to the bottom of the lake east of Suncrown Village and use the Bundle of Medallions on the Altar of Tidal Mastery. ,"That willful elemental ended many lives that fateful day when he revolted against us.  By calling to the lowly murloc to sabotage our rites he subverted our magic and turned it against us. Show him our thirst for vengeance has not waned!  Take these medallions and lay them at the Altar of Tidal Mastery at the bottom of the lake. Aquantion shall immediately answer your summons! Beware, <race>!  Without our magic controlling him, his wrath will be unrestrained.  Destroy Aquantion so we may rest! "
2350,Shadowpine Weaponry,"Collect 3 Headhunter Axes, 3 Shadowcaster Maces, 3 Catlord Claws and 3 Hexxer Staves. ","<class>, I want you to kill as many Shadowpine trolls as you can. We need their numbers greatly reduced before we can shift our attention toward Deatholme. And while you're at it, we might as well kill two birds with one stone, so bring me back a load of their weapons. Better that they not go to waste, and we can use them in the fight against the Scourge. Hit their camps hard to the east and the south at Zeb'Tela and Zeb'Nowa. "
2351,The Plagued Coast,Bring 6 Plagued Murloc Spines to Apothecary Renzithen in Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"To find a cure for the plague we need to understand how it affects different creatures, from the most complex life forms to the lowliest subspecies. I've come here to study the murlocs since, like us, they've retained free will in undeath.  What makes these lowly mongrels so special?  I need to find out, <name>! Travel northwest and bring me their spines so that I may study the accumulation of plague in their marrow.  Who knows what secrets their little bones hold? "
2352,Return to Arcanist Vandril,Return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"Now my friend, if you would be so kind as to return to Arcanist Vandril, I know that he is very anxious to send you out on your first mission here in the Ghostlands. We're counting on you, <name>.  Don't let us down. "
2353,Forgotten Rituals,Bring 8 Wavefront Medallions to Geranis Whitemorn in the Ghostlands. ,"Every year we, the denizens of Suncrown Village, would take part in a ritual to keep the different aspects of nature under our control.  Dominion over the element of water was symbolized by the summoning and enslavement of an elemental named Aquantion.  Through a wicked perversion of our magic, the scoundrel broke his bonds and enslaved us instead! We wore medallions shaped like waves during the ritual.  Seek them at the bottom of the lake; we'll need them to free my compatriots' spirits! "
2354,The Forsaken,Speak with High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"I know it seems strange, but the Forsaken are here to help. You should speak with their leader, High Executor Mavren.  He's in the tower on the west side of town. And, <class>, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately! "
2355,Underlight Ore Samples,Collect 6 Underlight Ore and deliver them to Magister Quallestis at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands. ,"I was sent here from the Sanctum of the Sun to collect some ore samples, but the gnolls have overrun the place! It's going to be my head on a platter if I don't get those samples to the magister soon. Maybe you could help, <class>? You can find the ore in the tin and copper veins here, and the gnolls are carrying it around, too. When you have enough, take it to Magister Quallestis at the Sanctum of the Sun directly to the east. Go across the Dead Scar and you'll find the sanctum just south of Sungraze Peak. "
2356,Return to Quartermaster Lymel,Purchase a flight back to Tranquillien in the Ghostlands and deliver Quartermaster Lymel's Goods to Quartermaster Lymel at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"It all checks out as far as I can tell.  Seems to me that the Forsaken have put their backs to the wall for us and we owe them, even if they are all ugly and rotting. So, the question is, have you already spoken to Skymaster Sunwing in Tranquillien?  If so, then this can be as simple as you paying the small fare and quickly flying back. Let me know when you're ready. "
2357,Salvaging the Past,Magister Darenis wants you to travel to the Sanctum of the Moon to the west of Tranquillien and recover 8 Crystallized Mana Essences from the Arcane Devourers and Mana Shifters that inhabit the structure. ,"Can you believe it?  We have an actual functioning arcane sanctum up and running southeast of here: the Sanctum of the Sun.  All manner of important magisters have come to take part in running it. Of course they've all forgotten about the Sanctum of the Moon.  Not much remains of it and its energies have given rise to bizarre creatures. I'm not one to let good resources go to waste, however.  Go to the Sanctum of the Moon and see if you can recover the crystallized essences from the creatures there. "
2358,The Forsaken,Speak with High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. ,"I know it seems strange, but these Forsaken are here to help. You should speak with their leader, High Executor Mavren. He's in the tower on the west side of town. And, <class>, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately! "
2359,Friend of the Sin'dorei,Take Dar'Khan's Head to Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City. ,"This is the beginning of a new chapter in blood elf history, <name>.  You've helped cement the bond between my race and yours, <race>. Take the traitor's head to Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City.  He'll be eager to hear the news. "
2360,Goods from Silvermoon City,Deliver Quartermaster Lymel's Bill of Lading to Skymaster Sunwing in Tranquillien. ,"Welcome volunteer!  We're running low on supplies here, but the blood elves have promised us materiel assistance.  That's where you come in. Take this bill of lading over to Skymaster Sunwing. He'll have further instructions for you on how best to get up to Silvermoon City. "
2361,The Rescue,Krusk in Tarren Mill needs you to free Drull and Tog'thar from Durnholde Keep. ,"Me and some other warriors were sent by the Warchief to retrieve an object from Durnholde and to investigate this so-called Syndicate. We went to Durnholde to take a look around, but we were taken by surprise by a large number of the humans. We fought bravely, but their sheer numbers were enough to defeat us. They took a few of us captive, but I was able to escape. Durnholde is just southeast of here, across the river. Drull and Tog'thar are being held there, you must go and rescue them. "
2362,Elixir of Agony,"Bring the Mudsnout Mixture, a Strong Troll's Blood Potion, 5 Daggerspine Scales and 5 Torn Fin Eyes to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill. ","A mudsnout composite?  Absolutely brilliant!  Why didn't I think of that? Let me contribute my colloid of decay to this devilish brew. In order to activate the contaminating agents in this mudsnout mixture, Lydon is going to need a strong troll's blood potion, as well as some daggerspine scales and torn fin eyes from the southern coast of Hillsbrad.  He'll know what to do once you've gathered him all the reagents.  And my, how anxious I am to hear how his experiment goes! "
2363,WANTED: Baron Vardus,Kill Baron Vardus and deliver his head to High Executor Darthalia in Tarren Mill. ,"By order of High Executor Darthalia, the human known as Baron Vardus is wanted for crimes against the Forsaken. Vardus is known to be a high-ranking member of the organization known as the Syndicate. He was last spotted in the Uplands in the Alterac Mountains, north of Tarren Mill. He is wanted dead. Bring evidence of his demise to High Executor Darthalia to claim the reward. "
2364,Dangerous! ,"High Executor Darthalia of Tarren Mill is offering a bounty on Clerk Horrace Whitesteed, Citizen Wilkes, Miner Hackett and Farmer Kalaba. ",Dangerous!

Citizen Wilkes.  Wanted for the murder of Apothecary Eli. Miner Hackett.  Wanted for the murder of Deathstalker Fry. Farmer Kalaba.  Wanted for the ambush of supplies from the Undercity. All of these enemies are hiding and will be hard to find.  A reward will be granted upon notice of their death. 
2365,Soothing Turtle Bisque,Bring 10 pieces of Turtle Meat to Chef Jessen in Southshore. ,"If there's one thing you'll learn about Southshore it's that we have some of the best cuisine north of Stormwind! Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks to travel from as far as Darkshire just to enjoy a bowl.  Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately.  I used to head up past Dalaran to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt Snapjaws but it's just too dangerous now. If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the Snapjaws up north, I'll whip some up! "
2366,Gol'dir,Free Gol'dir then return to Krusk in Tarren Mill. ,"From what I can tell of the documents you procured, Gol'dir is being held in a large Syndicate base to the north, most likely in the Alterac Mountains. He has been held captive far too long and must be freed. "
2367,Battle of Hillsbrad,"Travel to Dun Garok and kill 8 Mountaineers, 4 Riflemen, 2 Priests and Captain Ironhill and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill. ","Dwarves aiding the humans?  Damn those filthy little beasts. We shall test the strength of the so-called Alliance.  We'll see how anxious those little ankle-bashers are to help the humans once they feel our wrath.  We know exactly where their stronghold is in this territory. They have established a barracks in southeastern Hillsbrad along Thoradin's Wall called Dun Garok.  The final mission of this battle is to lay siege on Dun Garok, <class>. Captain Ironhill, their leader, must die. "
2368,Battle of Hillsbrad,Take Darthalia's Sealed Commendation to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity. ,"Because you fought with such valor and perseverance in the Battle of Hillsbrad, I have written this commendation, extolling your heroics in combat for the high command to recognize.

2369,Helcular's Revenge,"Charge the Rod of Helcular with the powers of the Flame of Azel, Flame of Veraz and the Flame of Uzel. ","Here, take the Rod of Helcular. You will need it. Helcular fashioned 3 ceremonial pyres as part of his most powerful spell.  The Flame of Azel and the Flame of Veraz lie within the Foothill Caverns. The Flame of Uzel lies in a cave above the caverns, further north in the mountains. The Rod of Helcular must be charged from each of the three flames. Once the ritual is complete, drive the rod into Helcular's grave in Southshore, the heavily guarded human town to the south.  Vengeance shall be ours! "
2370,Costly Menace,Darren Malvew of Southshore wants you to kill 8 Mountain Lions and 10 Hulking Mountain Lions. ,"Ain't nothin' that irks me more than losin' these here beautiful horses.  And believe me, we've lost quite a few between them pesky undead creeps, the dang Syndicate gang and all the other good-for-nothin' scoundrels pokin' about these parts. But I swear on my ol' grand-daddy's grave there ain't no bigger menace to our horses here than them Mountain Lions up in Alterac.  Always comin' down from the hills and makin' my life difficult! You fancy yourself a hero?  Go and do somethin' about it then! "
2371,Battle of Hillsbrad,"Kill 6 Hillsbrad Farmhands, 6 Hillsbrad Farmers, Farmer Ray and Farmer Getz and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill. ","Stand at attention while addressing me, <class>. I am under direct command of Varimathras.  We are to quell the human infestation until our apothecaries can develop the new plague. Our information leads us to believe that the town of Hillsbrad is vulnerable to attack.  Your first assignment is aimed at disrupting their food supply and infrastructure. Travel west.  Raid the northernmost farms of Hillsbrad Fields.  Make sure that the landowners, Farmer Ray and Farmer Getz, are executed as well. "

Oh wait, what is that, little <race>?  ""Bartolo, there is no finer cloak! ""  Yes, yes!  That, I have heard before. Bartolo requires a Bolt of Wool, a Hillman's Cloak made by a skilled leatherworker, Fine Thread and Yeti Fur, of course!  Bring to me these items and you shall be a happy customer! "
2373,The Crown of Will,Deliver the Crown of Will to Sharlindra in the Undercity. ,"All that remains is to deliver the Crown of Will to Sharlindra in the Undercity. She will see that it is delivered to Lady Sylvanas. I would warn you against thinking to use it for your own purposes, <name>, Mug'Thol's fate should be illustration enough. "
2374,Lord Aliden Perenolde,"Kill Lord Aliden Perenolde and ask his mistress, Elysa, about Taretha's pendant. ","It is clear that Perenolde must be killed, his foulness removed from the world. His manor lies a ways to the north of here, on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Do your duty, <name>, then retrieve the pendant that the Warchief desires, and return here. "
2375,Elixir of Agony,Bring a keg of Shindigger Stout to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill. ,"This new elixir is finally ready to be tested.  But why let a perfectly good, highly contagious plague go to waste on a mere frog or dog?  Let's have us some true fun in the name of Lady Sylvanas. Head down to Dun Garok.  You know the barracks where those filthy little dwarves skitter about.  Steal me a keg of their Shindigger Stout.  Once I have that keg, you and I will have quite the party, <name>. "
2376,Hints of a New Plague? ,Speak to Kinelory near Go'Shek Farm in Arathi Highlands. ,"< Quae begins to go through the folder. >This IS interesting. Seems Apothecary Jorell has been working on some deadly experiments here at Go'Shek. Not sure what that has to do with Hillsbrad, but Phin wouldn't like it if we let it continue. We had a run-in with some orcs while you were gone, and I'm not in good enough shape to help Kinelory. If you're up for it, she's going to need some protection when she goes down to the farm to steal whatever research Jorell still hasn't sent to Tarren Mill. "
2377,Hints of a New Plague? ,Find the Forsaken Courier and bring back her Sealed Folder to Quae near the Go'Shek Farm. ,"So, Phin sent you to check on us? Not surprised--he worries too much. We've been watching the farm for days, and Kin claims she saw a courier come out of that small house to the south not long ago. She talks a lot, but I can always trust her senses when we're in dangerous areas. You wouldn't happen to be a skilled tracker, would you? We think the courier might be carrying notes to Tarren Mill. If we could get our hands on those documents, it might shed some light on what's happening in Hillsbrad. "
2378,The Crown of Will,"Kill Mug'Thol, and return his head with the Crown of Will to Melisara in Tarren Mill. ","With Mug'Thol's lieutenants dead, all that remains is to kill Mug'Thol and retrieve the Crown of Will. I have no doubt he'll be reluctant to part with it. Most likely expecting you, too, given the. . . departure. . . of his fellows. Find Mug'Thol, and deliver his head and the Crown to me. The Crushridge resistance will be at an end. "
2379,Prison Break In,"Find the traitors and recover their artifacts, then return to Magus Voidglare in Tarren Mill. ","I came to Tarren Mill to research, but now must resolve a crisis.  You see, four Forsaken fled the Undercity a few months ago.  They turned their backs on their brethren, but what's worse. . . they stole from the Dark Lady. These thieves broke into a secure vault and stole four artifacts, items our apothecaries required in certain studies.  Sylvanas would have these artifacts returned. The thieves fled the Undercity to Dalaran, and those wizards quarantined them in the Lordamere Internment Camp. "
2380,Battle of Hillsbrad,Kill Magistrate Burnside and 4 Hillsbrad Councilmen. ,"The town of Hillsbrad is in disarray and we believe it will soon fall.  We must, however, persist in our ruthlessness until the human scum are wiped from the foothills for eternity. Despite their overwhelming losses, the humans rally around their leadership and keep fighting.  We must eliminate their leader, Magistrate Burnside, as well as the town council.  Destroy their revered political document as well, the Hillsbrad Proclamation.  And while you're at it, steal the town registry. "
2381,The Crown of Will,Kill 10 Crushridge Maulers for Melisara in Tarren Mill. ,"Mug'Thol and his Crushridge ogres have overrun the ruins of Alterac. It will be hard to inflict any serious punishment upon him without thinning out the ogres' numbers. After softening them up, we'll proceed. Understood? Good. Now go. "
2382,Report to Tarren Mill,Travel to Tarren Mill in the Hillsbrad Foothills and speak with Advisor Duskingdawn. ,"Ah, good to see you here, <class>!  I've a task that you are perfectly suited to. As new members of the Horde, we need to make sure that we support their efforts and help them with their problems.  That way they'll be more receptive to helping us with ours. Travel to the Forsaken town, Tarren Mill, in the Hillsbrad Foothills to the southeast.  Check in with Advisor Duskingdawn when you arrive. "
2383,Battle of Hillsbrad,Kill Foreman Bonds and 10 Hillsbrad Miners and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill. ,"The Hillsbrad Town Registry indicates that the Azurelode Mine is under Alliance control.  Furthermore, the mine is a prime source of iron ore for the Alliance armories. Even though we've struck a decisive blow to the town of Hillsbrad, the Alliance still supports and protects the Azurelode Mine fervently. The mine lies due south of Hillsbrad.  Go there and slay the foreman, a human by the name of Bonds.  Kill his miners as well.  That should send a clear message to the Alliance. "
2384,Battle of Hillsbrad,Kill Blacksmith Verringtan and 4 Hillsbrad Apprentice Blacksmiths. ,"The humans of Hillsbrad have been putting up unexpected resistance.  The problem appears to be that the townsfolk are being armed by the local blacksmith.  We need to shut down all supply lines. Your mission will be to execute Blacksmith Verringtan.  Slay his apprentices as well.  While there, bring back a shipment of iron from their stockpile.  The supplies will come in handy when we are done with the conquering of Hillsbrad and begin razing Southshore. "
2385,Helcular's Revenge,Retrieve Helcular's Rod from the Yeti and bring it back to Novice Thaivand in Tarren Mill. ,Master Helcular was almost complete with his transformation into a Lich when a human lynch mob discovered his ritual lair in the hills and brutally killed him.  To make matters worse they buried his corpse in the Southshore cemetery. Such disregard for the great wizard is unacceptable.  As his apprentice I shall see to it that the rains of vengeance fall upon the town of Southshore. We will need Helcular's Rod first.  Yeti overtook his ritual lair.  Undoubtedly one of the beasts has it. 
2386,Elixir of Agony,Place the Tainted Keg on the rug for the captured farmers. ,"Next door the Deathguards are holding a few captured farmers hostage.  High Executor Darthalia suspected one of the military strategists from Stormwind to be hiding out amongst them.  Apparently the military chap was found dead in the Plaguelands last night.  Darthalia, always looking out for me, decided the prisoners would be left to my disposal. I think it's time we threw those farmers a party.  Sounds like a grand ol' time! Place this tainted keg on the rug in their room.  Plagued brew for all! "
2387,Elixir of Pain,Feed the Elixir of Pain to Stanley. ,"Ah, nothing like the smell of fresh blood in the foothills! Now we'll mix in a touch of this and a little of that and let the real fun begin!  What I have created with this blood, I like to call an Elixir of Pain.  If my calculations are correct this concoction could be the start of something very beautiful for Lady Sylvanas.  But what we need is a test. Take this elixir out to the northern farm in Hillsbrad Fields to the southwest.  Let's see how Farmer Ray's little dog Stanley likes this ""treat. """
2388,The Crown of Will,"Kill Targ, Muckrake, and Glommus and bring their heads to Melisara in Tarren Mill. ","Targ, Muckrake, and Glommus are Mug'Thol's lieutenants. They are loyal to him, though who can say what drives an ogre to loyalty. Bring me their heads, <name>, and then all that will remain is to remove Mug'Thol's head, crown and all. "
2389,Elixir of Pain,Bring 10 vials of Mountain Lion Blood to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill. ,"Oh, <name>. . . the flowers are blooming in Hillsbrad and the air is so fresh and brisk.  I can't help but to wallow in the misery of it all.  I look out my grimy window and long for the day when our New Plague brings this world the death it deserves. As much as I would love to sit and brood all day, my duty to the Dark Lady calls.  Help me, would you?  My research leads me to believe I can make the most splendid death-brew with the blood of a Mountain Lion.  Bring some to me and we'll have a little fun. "
2390,Infiltration,Retrieve information about Gol'dir's whereabouts for Krusk in Tarren Mill. ,"At last we begin to hear word and rumor, find evidence of Gol'dir's whereabouts. The humans have been moving him around, but we are narrowing down our search and focusing on the large Syndicate camp just north of here. Go there, <name>, and bring back whatever information you can get your hands on. "
2391,Elixir of Agony,Bring 6 Mudsnout Blossoms to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill. ,"Another day, another elixir to be made. If it were up to me, I'd just let the pathetic humans and Scourge fight it out.  They seem bent on killing each other as is. Alas, our Dark Lady wants to help speed up the process a tad so why not pass these morbid days by spreading a little death and disease across the land? Here's the plan, <name>: you go out to Nethander Stead, south of Tarren Mill and east of the river and Southshore. Collect for me 6 Mudsnout Blossoms from the field for my next elixir. "
2392,Souvenirs of Death,Deathguard Samsa of Tarren Mill wants 30 Hillsbrad Human Skulls. ,"I hear you were enlisted by Darthalia to wage war on the humans of Hillsbrad.  So jealous I am. . . While you're off having all the fun -- slaying humans, pillaging the town, terrorizing innocent people -- I am stuck standing guard here in Tarren Mill. Perhaps you'll take pity on an old Deathguard like myself?  You see I am collecting human skulls.  And you will be fighting humans for quite some time.  Over the course of your long battle, bring me 30 skulls and I will make it worth your while. "
2393,Hints of a New Plague? ,Find Quae and Kinelory near the Go'Shek Farm in the Arathi Highlands. ,"Hail, and well met, <name>. I lead a group of adventurers investigating odd happenings in this area. My cousin in Hillsbrad recently put down his dog Stanley because the animal mystically grew to an immense size and savagely attacked anyone who came near him. I believe the undead are involved, and we're looking for signs to prove as much. Two of my companions, Quae and Kinelory, headed to the Go'Shek Farm in the Arathi Highlands, and haven't checked in for days. Find them for me? I grow concerned. "
2394,The Hammer May Fall,"Kill 8 Boulderfist Ogres and 10 Boulderfist Enforcers, then find Drum Fel in the Hammerfall outpost in Arathi Highlands. ","Weaklings. . . all of them. You, <class>, what are you looking at? Think you're something special, huh? Why not prove it? The Hammerfall outpost in Arathi's under attack. Unless we send them help soon, their demise is imminent. But before you go rushing off, you may want to test your skills first. Northeast of Stromgarde in Arathi is an ogre mound inhabited by the Boulderfist tribe. When you can handle the ogres and enforcers there, then report to Drum Fel in Hammerfall. "
2395,Elixir of Agony,Take the Mudsnout Composite to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity. ,"Just when I thought another day was going to pass devoid of any joy, you brought me those marvelous Mudsnout Blossoms. First I will mix them down into a fine composite.  We'll then need Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity to apply his colloid of decay to it and then we'll be ready for some good fun indeed! Here, take this Mudsnout Composite and run it off to Master Faranell at once, <name>. "
2396,WANTED: Syndicate Personnel,Kill 10 Syndicate Rogues and 10 Syndicate Watchmen. ,"By the authority of Lady Sylvanas, all members of the organization known as the Syndicate are wanted dead.

2398,Dalaran Patrols,"Kill 6 Dalaran Summoners and 12 Elemental Slaves, then return to Magus Voidglare in Tarren Mill. ","The wizards of Dalaran constructed a vast, magical dome around the heart of their city.  Some believe it was for protection from the violence of these times, while others say they merely wanted solitude, to study and plot. I don't care what the reason was.  I do care that the ruined outskirts of their city may hide valuable magical treasures. But the area is patrolled by the wizards and their elemental slaves. So hunt them, and return when their numbers are sufficiently reduced. "
2399,Stone Tokens,Bring 10 Worn Stone Tokens to Keeper Bel'varil in Tarren Mill. ,"A notable talent of the wizards of Dalaran is their familiarity with elementals: powerful creatures from other dimensions.  The wizards use magical tokens as a means to control these elementals.  Magus Voidglare would like some of these tokens to study. Enter the territories of the Dalaran wizards, west of Hillsbrad, and gather the tokens. You might find the tokens on any citizen of Dalaran, but I suggest hunting at the internment camp.  It's safer than Dalaran itself. "
2400,Humbert's Sword,Retrieve Deathguard Humbert's sword from Dun Garok and return it to him in Tarren Mill. ,"High Executor Darthalia sent me to keep watch of Dun Garok from a distance.  I had set up camp just out of sight.  But when morning came and I had to boil water, I left to gather firewood. When I returned to camp, I discovered my gear was missing. Apparently some dwarven scouts from Dun Garok had passed by and made off with it.  I need my sword!  If you can get it back for me I would be so grateful.  So many dwarves there. . . it will be quite difficult to find the dirty little thief who stole it. "
2401,Time To Strike,Travel to Tarren Mill to deliver Deathstalker Lesh's message to High Executor Darthalia. ,"Be silent and pay attention, <class>. I was sent to this position in order to survey the town of Hillsbrad.  My mission is one of reconnaissance.  It is imperative that you send word to High Executor Darthalia in Tarren Mill at once.  Let her know that I, Deathstalker Lesh, send the following message: ""The raven's cry from the west doth beckon. ""Follow the road to the east and pay close attention to the signs.  Now, hurry!  Off you go to Tarren Mill, and with urgency I might add! "
2402,Elixir of Suffering,Give Umpi the Elixir of Suffering. ,"It will take but a moment for me to mix these components into what I have deemed an Elixir of Suffering. There we go!

2403,Battle of Hillsbrad,Take Darthalia's Sealed Commendation to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity. ,"Because you fought with such valor and perseverance in the Battle of Hillsbrad, I have written this commendation, extolling your heroics in combat for the high command to recognize. Take this sealed commendation to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity.  Go with pride, <class>. "
2404,Missing Crystals,Retrieve the Shipment of Rare Crystals from the Forsaken and return it to Huraan in Southshore. ,"If there's one great truth about Hillsbrad, it's that this region is destined to live under the shadow of war. Even something as innocuous as a cartload of stone is a target. Normally the loss of building materials is no great setback, but the most recent shipment from the Azurelode mine contained a crate of rare crystals I was eager to study. Forsaken raiders intercepted the cart and drove it northeast to a tower they're attempting to rebuild. It's imperative that we retrieve those crystals, <class>! "
2405,Elixir of Suffering,Apothecary Lydon of Tarren Mill wants 10 Gray Bear Tongues and some Creeper Ichor. ,"Ah, another wretched day in Tarren Mill.  All of this clean air puts me in such a foul mood, <name>. The sooner we can plague the humans here, the better.  I've been conducting intense studies on possible killing agents to use in my concoctions but I haven't the time to collect them all. If you want to make yourself of use, procure the following items for me:  10 Gray Bear Tongues and the very rare and hard to find, Creeper Ichor.  You'll find both bears and creepers just outside of Tarren Mill. "
2406,Stormwind Ho! ,Kill 10 Daggerspine Shorehunters and 10 Daggerspine Sirens for Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore. ,"My former mentor in the Stormwind city guard sent a message to me that Alliance High Command is becoming concerned with the threat posed by the naga. From what he's heard, there's good chances for promotion--or at least reassignment--for anyone who proves valuable in this regard. There's just one small problem. . . I can't handle the naga, <name>. Oh sure, I could break up a drunken barroom brawl, or haul off a belligerent beggar, but the naga are too much for me. You've got to help me, <name>! "
2407,Battle of Hillsbrad,Kill 15 Hillsbrad Peasants and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill. ,"Word of the attack on the northern farms has the townsfolk panicked.  Most excellent. Our Deathstalkers report peasants fleeing to the fields in southern Hillsbrad.  The fools think they can hide in the orchards and escape their doom. Prove them wrong, <name>.  Return to Hillsbrad Fields and seek out the cowering peasants.  Lay waste to them in the name of our Dark Lady. Dismissed! "
2408,Farren's Proof,Speak with Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore. ,"Please inform Lieutenant Orinelle that I would like him to refocus his efforts on the naga infesting the Eastern Strand. When he has results, tell him to report to me in person. "
2409,Hints of a New Plague? ,Find Phin Odelic at Southshore in Hillsbrad Foothills. ,"I've seen Kinelory look way worse after a night in the tavern than she does now. You obviously did a good job protecting her. These items she brought back from the farm should at least let Phin get an idea of what's going on out here in Arathi. Just to make sure there's no retaliation after your attack, we're going to stay here for a bit longer. Would you be willing to head back to Southshore and talk to Phin? "
2410,Down the Coast,Kill 10 Torn Fin Tidehunters and 10 Torn Fin Oracles for Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore. ,"Transferred from the Stormwind city guard to Southshore, a town that should be abandoned by the looks of it. . . Smell of the harbor day and night. Not to mention ol' Redpath. . . Wants me to take care of the murlocs. Ha! I can barely rouse myself to go out to some of the pockets of the overgrown fish down the Western Strand. If you would go in my place and take care of them, I'd appreciate it. "
2411,Blackmoore's Legacy,Return the information gathered by Gol'dir to Krusk in Tarren Mill. ,"A day or two ago, I was visited by the leader of this Syndicate. His name was Aliden Perenolde, and styled himself lord of this land. He confided in me his plans to take the orcs that stood against him as slaves, just as his father and his mentor, the despised Blackmoore, had planned. More important was that he brought his mistress, a wisp of a girl named Elysa. Around her neck was the pendant the Warchief desires. Now go, I will make my own way, after I have settled my business here. "
2412,Farren's Proof,Collect 10 Murloc Heads from the murlocs on the Western Strand for Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore. ,"Would you believe it, <name>? Redpath wasn't satisfied with all the murlocs we killed--oh now, don't be modest, you had some hand in it. Now he wants me to bring proof of the dead, hacking off cold, slimy murloc heads to submit for his approval. "
2413,Reassignment,Deliver Farren's report to Major Samuelson in Stormwind Keep. ,"It shouldn't be a problem getting my report seen. The new captain of the guard, Major Samuelson, was my mentor while I was stationed in Stormwind. It should give him more than enough excuse to have me transferred back to the city. I'll need you to carry my report to him, though. . . wouldn't want ol' Redpath to catch on. "
2414,Farren's Proof,Deliver the sack of murloc heads to Marshall Redpath in Southshore. ,"You know, <name>, I'd really rather not take these heads. . . Since you've already got a handle on them, would you mind delivering them to Redpath for me? "
2415,Bracers of Binding,Bring 4 Bracers of Earth Binding to Keeper Bel'varil in Tarren Mill. ,"The Magus will be busy studying those stone tokens you gathered, but I know he'll eventually want examples of their counterpart: bracers of binding.  These are set around the wrists of actual elementals, and bind them into the mage's service. Hunt elementals in the ruins of Dalaran and gather their Bracers of Earth Binding, and the Magus will be pleased. "

","Magic was once as revered as Elune herself to some elves. Some of their most powerful mages created runes and tablets citing rules of the arcane and insights into their findings. They would leave these for all to ponder in public places. I would very much like rubbings of these runes from the Ruins of Eldarath. I have a kit for you to make the rubbings with, but it will be up to you to find them. Be careful though, the Explorer's League isn't the only one interested in Eldarath. "
2419,Find Bingles,Find Bingles Blastenheimer in Loch Modan. ,"We've lost contact with Bingles! He was sent on a reconnaissance mission over Gnomeregan and hasn't reported back in over a week.

2420,At Last! ,Take the Proof of Deed back to Mountaineer Pebblebitty. ,"I can't believe Pebblebitty doubted the authenticity of the horn. Between you and me, I think she's just jealous. I know she really wanted to kill that beast herself, what with the 'incident' and all. So you need a proof of deed?

2423,Dwarven Justice,Return to the Searing Gorge and find Dorius's archaeology unit. ,"There is an empty, vacuous hole, where my heart used to be, <name>.

2426,Speak with Shoni,Speak with Shoni the Shilent at the Dwarven District in Stormwind. ,"Perhaps. . . Perhaps you can help us in the battle for Gnomeregan.

You will probably find her amongst the dwarves in Stormwind. Good luck, <name>. "
2427,A Future Task,Speak with High Explorer Magellas in Ironforge. ,"Well <name>. . . we seem to be at a temporary dead end here.  We know what we need - the Plates of Uldum - but we have no idea where they might be.  We'll need to do quite a bit of research on this to come up with a solid plan of attack.

I know it sounds odd, but they're all over! I helped a lady in Menethil find her bag not too long ago--it was eaten by oozes. I've seen members of the Royal Apothecary Society from Undercity collecting samples of the stuff. I want to know why! Where does it come from? I've heard of more in Felwood. What I need are samples of the oozes there so I can further my research. I'll give you containers, you use them to collect a sample from the deceased creatures. "

I've something that might interest you. I have in my possession a set of armor much like the one worn by those of your profession, but of much higher quality.  I'd be willing to trade the bracers for ordinary ones in exchange for a small favor. The blood of the frostsabers and bears that inhabit Winterspring has properties I'm in need of at the moment.  Bring me a sizeable sample of it along with the bracers and a small amount of gold.  You shall find the effort worth your while. "
2499,Thalorien Dawnseeker,Visit Thalorien Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar. ,"You are the one working with Myralion Sunblaze, arent you? I know of a way we can test the sword. If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell. "
2500,Thalorien Dawnseeker,Visit Thalorien Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar. ,"If you truly bear Quel'Delar, <name>, I might be able to admit you to the Sunwell. If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell. "
2501,Journey To The Sunwell,Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas. ,"Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, <name>. Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword. The guardians will try to stop you from entering the Sunwell Plateau, but make yourself known to Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there. "
2502,Journey To The Sunwell,Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas. ,"Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, <name>. Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword. The guardians of the Sunwell will not simply allow you to walk in, so you must find Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there. "
2503,Crisis at the Sunwell,Adyen the Lightwarden on the Aldor Rise in Shattrath City has requested that you travel to Sunwell Plateau and speak with Larethor. ,"By the naaru, I thank you, <race>, for your efforts. Our work is far from finished, however, and I must request that you undertake a critical mission - one as important as any I've issued. Our forces are spread thinly. To compound the strain, we've had to dispatch a contingent to Azeroth to investigate developments at the Sunwell Plateau. You are needed there, <name>. Report to Larethor. Tell him that I wish we could spare more men. "
2504,Duty Calls,Dathris Sunstriker on Scryer's Tier in Shattrath City has insisted that you travel to Azeroth at once and report to Larethor at the Sunwell. ,"Hear me, <race>. Duty requires that you return to Azeroth. Every able person is to report to the Sunwell Plateau immediately. I'm afraid I have no more information to share, except this: You'll be joining forces with the Aldor for this mission. Speak with a draenei by the name of Larethor when you arrive. Apparently, the situation calls for us to set our differences aside and join forces. Prepare yourself, friend. This sounds serious. "
2505,The Missing Magistrix,Use the Captured Legion Scroll near the portal at Dawning Square. ,"We sent one of our operatives to investigate the fel portal in the middle of Dawning Square, south of here.  She never returned. Take this scroll we found on one of the enemy corpses.  We believe it will grant you access through the portal.  Once through, find Magistrix Seyla and aid her in any way you can. "
2506,Arm the Wards! ,Captain Theris Dawnhearth at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to obtain 4 Mana Remnants from Wretched Fiends and Wretched Devourers and use them to energize one of the Crystal Wards surrounding the structures in Sun's Reach. ,"We've succeeded in reactivating the crystal wards around the sanctum, but why stop there?  We'll build defenses around the other structures, but the Wretched are stubborn and continue to steal power from the crystal wards. Hunt them down and get the mana remnants they carry.  Use the remnants to energize the sanctum wards; the safety of our operation depends on it. "
2507,A Magnanimous Benefactor,Anchorite Kairthos wants you to donate 1000 gold to aid in Anchorite Ayuri's efforts. ,"You've done so much for us, <name>.  We greatly appreciate your assistance. You might have noticed Anchorite Ayuri's efforts outside.  She has a big heart and is very convincing, but the donations do not quite add up to what she had expected. If you were to make a large contribution to her cause, I will make sure that word of your deeds in this war spreads far and wide.  What do you say? "
2509,Your Continued Support,Anchorite Ayuri at Sun's Reach in Sunwell Isle wants you to donate 10 gold. ,We've built a memorial to honor those slain in battle.  It's but a small consolation to the families that lost their loved ones. I am taking up a collection to aid the orphans and spouses of our war heroes.  If you can spare a small donation it would go a long way. 
2510,Know Your Ley Lines,"Astromancer Darnarian in the Sun's Reach Sanctum wants you to use the Astromancer's Crystal at the Bloodcrystal, the Dawning Square portal, and the naga shrine at Greengill Coast. ","Freeloaders! You all want instant gratification - never giving thought to the effort required to create even the simplest of portals. Perhaps a little education will instill a bit of gratitude for my ceaseless efforts. Take this crystal. Attune it to the Bloodcrystal to the west, at the Dawning Square portal just south of here, and at the naga shrine at Greengill Coast to the southeast. Perhaps then you'll appreciate your precious translocations. . . . "
2511,The Air Strikes Must Continue,Battlemage Arynna wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker when you're ready to fly over the Dead Scar. ,"We've taken the armory from the enemy thanks to our aerial attacks against the Legion's forces in the Dead Scar. As a matter of fact, it's gone so well that we're going to continue our air strikes against them.  Take these arcane charges and use them against their forces. Talk to Ayren Cloudbreaker at the Sun's Reach Harbor when you're ready for flight. "
2512,Intercept the Reinforcements,Vindicator Kaalan at the Sun's Reach Armory wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker and fly over the Dawnblade reinforcement fleet. ,"We're making a push to solidify our control of Sun's Reach by capturing the harbor next.  Unfortunately a fleet of Dawnblade reservists is on its way to reinforce Kael's forces there. Take this oil and secure a dragonhawk from Ayren Cloudbreaker.    You should be able to fly within reach of the ships' sails; once you're close enough, set them on fire. Land in one of the ships and attack the reservists.  With their ship sails on fire they won't be able to mount much of a defense. "
2513,The Battle Must Go On,Harbinger Inuuro wants you to slay 6 Burning Legion Demons and the Emissary of Hate in Dawning Square. ,"We must continue to defeat and demoralize the armies of the Legion. The emissaries of hate are Legion shocktroopers deployed to reinforce tactical Legion positions.  The enemy rallies around them for they fear them more than they fear us. Today we will change that.  Take this banner and slay the demons of the Legion.  When you meet the emissary, slay and impale him. "
2514,The Sanctum Wards,Captain Theris Dawnhearth at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to obtain 4 Mana Remnants from Wretched Fiends and Wretched Devourers and use them to energize one of the Crystal Wards surrounding the Sun's Reach Sanctum to the east. ,"Our first priority is to capture the Sun's Reach Sanctum.  Once we've secured it, we'll be able to use its energy to open a portal from Shattrath. The sanctum is overrun with the Wretched - former blood elves who've devolved into mindless husks of their former selves.  Its defenses would've normally prevented this intrusion, but the Wretched have stolen the power sources from the protective wards. Hunt down the Wretched and get the mana remnants they carry.  Use them to energize the sanctum wards. "
2515,Crush the Dawnblade,"Magister Ilastar at Sun's Reach Armory wants you to slay 6 Dawnblade Summoners, 6 Dawnblade Blood Knights and 3 Dawnblade Marksmen. ","We've driven the Dawnblade army out of the Sun's Reach Harbor.  Sun's Reach is ours in its entirety.  Yet somehow. . . I'm not entirely satisfied. I want you to go to Dawnstar Village, west of here, and slay any surviving Dawnblade combatants.  They sealed their fate when they followed Kael to this place. "
2516,Further Conversions,Vindicator Xayann at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to place the Attuned Crystal Cores inside 5 defeated Erratic Sentries to turn them into friendly units. ,My plan to replace the damaged crystals on the erratic sentries has been a success.  We've managed to take the Sun's Reach Sanctum with their help. I've crafted new crystals that will bring more of them under our control; place them inside the hulls of defeated sentries.  We'll deploy them to other locations once they're converted. 
2517,Keeping the Enemy at Bay,Vindicator Kaalan at the Sun's Reach Armory wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker and fly over the Dawnblade reinforcement fleet. ,"We've managed to capture Sun's Reach in its entirety.  Unfortunately a fleet of Dawnblade reservists is on its way to take back the harbor. Take this oil and secure a dragonhawk from Ayren Cloudbreaker.  You should be able to fly within reach of the ships' sails; once you're close enough, set them on fire. Land in one of the ships and attack the reservists.  With their ship sails on fire they won't be able to mount much of a defense. "
2518,The Battle for the Sun's Reach Armory,Harbinger Inuuro wants you to slay 6 Burning Legion Demons and the Emissary of Hate in Dawning Square or the Sun's Reach Armory. ,"The Burning Legion holds the Sun's Reach Armory, which is of tactical importance to our operation.  As long as their morale remains high we will not wrest the building from their control. The emissaries of hate are Legion shocktroopers deployed to reinforce tactical Legion positions.  The enemy rallies around them for they fear them more than they fear us. Today we will change that.  Take this banner and slay the demons of the Legion.  When you meet the emissary, slay and impale him. "
2519,Distraction at the Dead Scar,Battlemage Arynna wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker when you're ready to fly over the Dead Scar. ,"The Legion will move against us as soon as their forces to the south are freed up.  The Scourge at the Dead Scar are keeping their forces occupied at the moment.  It won't last long, however. I want you to fly a dragonhawk over to the scar and put a dent in the demons' numbers with these arcane charges. If all goes well, they won't even notice us taking the armory from Kael's lackeys.  Talk to Ayren, the dragonhawk master in the west part of the harbor, when you're ready to fly there. "
2520,Disrupt the Greengill Coast,Captain Valindria wants you to free 10 Greengill Slaves. ,"The naga have taken the Greengill Coast to the southeast. Their females, the Darkspine sirens, are using magic to enslave the indigenous murlocs. It's my responsibility to see to it that whatever the naga are up to over there is disrupted. That's where you come in. <class>, I want you to get the controlling orbs from the female naga and throw them near the Greengill slaves, breaking the orb and setting the murlocs free. My guess is that the murlocs will be incensed and turn on their masters. "
2521,Erratic Behavior,Vindicator Xayanna at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to place the Attuned Crystal Cores inside 5 defeated Erratic Sentries to turn them into friendly units. ,"We lack the numbers to capture the Sanctum at Sun's Reach, but I've a plan that will tip the scales in our favor. The loose energy from the Sunwell has caused the sentries that patrol this island to malfunction.  The crystal cores that control their behavior are damaged beyond repair. I've crafted new crystals that will bring them under our control; place them inside of the hulls of defeated sentries.  We will need all the help we can get. "
2522,Exalted Among All Combatants,"You are one of our very best, &lt; name&gt; . ","You are one of our very best, <name>.  Your name will be known throughout our ranks for a long time to come. Please accept this small gift on the behalf of our forces. "
2523,"Enter, the Deceiver. . . ","Report to Archmage Ne'thul on the Isle of Quel'Danas, north of Quel'Thalas. ","Despite our best efforts, Kael'thas's sinister plans have been carried out. The Sunwell has been re-ignited in preparation for the Deceiver's arrival. The object that stands before me and below A'dal is a representation of the current status of the Sunwell's defenses. Mighty barriers have been raised, stymieing our attacks against the inner chambers. If ever there were a time that our world needed assistance, it would be now. Report to Archmage Ne'thul at the Isle of Quel'Danas, north of Quel'Thalas. "
2524,A Charitable Donation,Anchorite Ayuri at Sun's Reach in Sunwell Isle wants you to donate 10 gold. ,We've taken Sun's Reach from the enemy and our final victory is at hand.  The cost was high and many brave combatants gave their lives so we could achieve this. It is my goal to ensure that those who perished in combat are not forgotten.  I ask that you take a moment to consider making a donation towards a memorial fund.  Any leftover gold will go to the widows and orphans of the fallen.

2526,Revered in the Field of Battle,"We couldn't have gotten where we are without you, &lt; name&gt; . ","We couldn't have gotten where we are without you, <name>.  The combined might of the Aldor and Scryers is not enough to crush the Legion and Kael.  We are thankful to have allies of your caliber among us. "
2527,Don't Stop Now. . . . ,Smith Hauthaa in Sun's Reach Armory wants you to kill Darkspine Myrmidon to the east and use their keys to steal three pieces of the ore from their chests. ,"Now that we have an anvil, I can really get to work. No matter how many supplies we receive, I'll always be able to put the Darkspine Iron Ore to good use. We'll need a constant supply of weapons and armor if we're to be successful here. There are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here. They're collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion. Relieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one. . . . "
2528,Making Ready,Smith Hauthaa in Sun's Reach Armory wants you to kill Darkspine Myrmidon to the east and use their keys to steal three pieces of the ore from their chests. ,"Supplies are inbound, or so I'm told. Regardless, we can ill afford to wait around hoping that help arrives before our offensive stalls. We must make the best of what we have. As for me, I need ore to fashion an anvil so I can begin to upgrade our armor and weapons. There are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion. Relieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one. . . . "
2529,Taking the Harbor,"Magister Ilastar at Sun's Reach Armory wants you to slay 6 Dawnblade Summoners, 6 Dawnblade Blood Knights and 3 Dawnblade Marksmen. ","One of Kael's most elite forces, the Dawnblade army, has been stationed at the Sun's Reach Harbor and Dawnstar Village. The harbor is of critical importance to our plans, so any Dawnblade casualties you inflict will be of tremendous help.  Kael'thas will rue the day that he turned his back on his people and sided with the Burning Legion. "
2530,A Friend in the Frontlines,"Your aid in the offensive has not gone unnoticed, &lt; name&gt; . ","Your aid in the offensive has not gone unnoticed, <name>.  The combined forces of the Aldor and Scryers offer you their thanks. "
2531,Open for Business,Mar'nah at the Sun's Reach Harbor wants you to gather 5 Bloodberries from the bushes found on Quel'Danas. ,"Welcome, <name>. There are a number of ways I can assist you in your efforts here. For example, I've recently discovered a recipe for a unique elixir. The bloodberry grows wild in many regions of Azeroth and has long been considered nothing more than a nuisance. I've learned though, that when exposed to the Sunwell's power this plant takes on special properties that can be distilled and imbibed to magnify one's abilites. Bring me a sample from the nearby bushes and I'll show you what I mean. "
2532,The Hunter's Path,Speak with Dazalar at Dolanaar in Teldrassil. ,"Hello, young hunter. You look to me like you are skilled enough to handle a beast and train it as your companion. You must see Dazalar in Dolanaar. He can put you on the path to earning a pet of your own. "
2533,WANTED: Chok'sul,Kill Chok'sul and bring his head to Magistrate Bluntnose of Thelsamar. ,"By order of the Magistrate of Thelsamar: Chok'sul, the ogre presumed to be the leader and coordinator of attacks against the town of Thelsamar, Stonewrought Dam, and the excavation site, is wanted dead through any means necessary. Monetary compensation will be provided when proof is brought to the Magistrate of Chok'sul's death. Chok'sul was last seen at the ogre encampment in the northeastern part of Loch Modan. "
2534,In Defense of the King's Lands,Mountaineer Gravelgaw in the southern guard tower wants you to kill 10 Stonesplinter Skullthumpers and 10 Stonesplinter Seers and report back to him. ,"Mountaineer Cobbleflint had nothing but good things to say about you, <race>.  For that reason I am going to entrust upon you a mission of utmost importance.  We need to keep pressure on the invading Trogg forces until our Dwarven brethren return from the Alliance front. Set forth into the southern hills and kill 10 Stonesplinter Skullthumpers and 10 Stonesplinter Seers.  Your attacks will buy us some time.  Report back when your mission is complete. "
2535,After the Ambush,Speak with Miran. ,"We'd been hauling the barrels of powder back and forth in trips before this. . . business. Now we have to split up the work, Miran 's taking the barrels and I'm watching over the other ones. I don't feel safe letting Miran haul the rest of the shipment by himself. When he's ready to go, maybe you could escort him on his next trip? "
2536,A Dark Threat Looms,The Disarming Mixture seemed to take effect. ,The keg fizzles slightly. 
2537,A Dark Threat Looms,"Chief Engineer Hinderweir wants you to swim down to the base of the dam, locate the powder keg and stir in the Disarming Mixture to prevent an explosion. ",Earlier today I spotted some Dark Iron Insurgents swimming toward the Dam with a large keg.  No Mountaineers were on hand to stop them!  I'm afraid they've planted the Seaforium at the base of the Dam and it could blow at any minute!  Let me combine all these ingredients into the Disarming Mixture.  There we go. Now I need you to take this mixture and stir it into the keg before it's too late!  Hurry! 
2538,Thelsamar Blood Sausages,"Bring 3 pieces of Bear Meat, 3 Boar Intestines, and 3 Spider Ichor to Vidra Hearthstove in Thelsamar. ","There's never a shortage of empty bellies here in Thelsamar, kids running in and out, workers from the excavation coming in after  a hard day's work. We're famous for our blood sausages, I don't suppose you've ever tried them? No? Well, around here you've got to work for your meals, and don't think just because you're a fancy <class>, you'll be any exception. I'll need bear meat, boar intestines for the casings, and spider ichor for spice. You get me some of those, and leave the cooking to Vidra! "
2539,Rat Catching,Bring 12 Tunnel Rat Ears to Mountaineer Kadrell in Thelsamar. ,"We have a real infestation problem to the west.  Tunnel rat kobolds have moved into the foothills, setting up dens and fouling our land with their filth! We want them eliminated.  Hunt them, bring me their ears and earn their bounty. You can find tunnel rat kobolds and their dens west of Thelsamar, littered along the mountainside. "
2540,Crocolisk Hunting,Get 5 pieces of Crocolisk Meat and 6 Crocolisk Skins for Marek Ironheart at the Farstrider Lodge. ,"Many a hunter is attracted to Loch Modan to hunt our famous crocs. There are always merchants who seek out crocolisk skins for clothing items or armor, and there are also some who enjoy the taste of their meat. We do some trade in this, but not a huge amount, as the crocolisks are ferocious and have entrenched themselves on the islands in the Loch. But don't let me dissuade you, it's quite an experience, wrestling with the jaws of the beasts. Why, this one time. . . "
2541,Protecting the Shipment,"Ensure Miran and the shipment arrive at the excavation site, then inform Prospector Ironband. ","Ready to go, <name>? First, we need to get this powder to Ironband. It'll be a lot for me to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for me. I'll feel a lot better with you coming along. "
2542,A Dark Threat Looms,"Chief Engineer Hinderweir wants you to gather Lurker Venom, a Mo'grosh Crystal, and a Crocolisk Tear. ","Begin collecting the disarming materials immediately, <name>. Lurker Venom can be found on the indigenous spiders in Loch Modan. Crocolisk tears are found here in the Loch as well.  But a Mo'Grosh crystal will be very difficult to procure.  The ogres to the northeast mine them but the crystals are a very rare commodity. We need to be prepared to defuse a Dark Iron attack!  Return to me once you've collected the needed items and I will prepare the mixture. "
2543,In Defense of the King's Lands,"Kill the Trogg leader, Grawmug, and his two guards, Gnasher and Brawler then report back to Captain Rugelfuss in the southern guard tower. ","<name>, our scouts have identified the leader of this recent Trogg incursion.  It appears that these beasts in Loch Modan are following the lead of a chieftain named Grawmug. Grawmug is heavily guarded, however.  Two of his most elite guards, Gnasher and Brawler, never leave his side. If you feel yourself worthy, <name>, I want you to lead the assassination mission on Grawmug and his two thugs.  With the Trogg leadership dead, we just might stand a chance at pushing these beasts back into the ground. "
2544,In Defense of the King's Lands,Mountaineer Wallbang in the southern guard tower wants you to kill 10 Stonesplinter Shaman and 10 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers. ,"The Mountaineers tell me you are quite brave and capable, <name>.  We need a <race> like you around here.  The Trogg problem isn't getting any better.  The reserves have been called to the front and we're all alone out here.  But now that we have a seasoned <class> here, let's see what you can do. Go out and kill 10 Stonesplinter Shaman and 10 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers.  Let's see if you live up to your reputation, Trogg-Slayer. "
2545,Stormpike's Order,Bring Stormpike's Request to Furen Longbeard in Stormwind. ,"There is a dwarven armorsmith whose work I admire greatly.  His name is Furen Longbeard, and his skill is unmatched.  I need a new shield, and I must have one of his! The problem is. . . Furen is far to the south, in the dwarven district within Stormwind.  In human lands!  I can't imagine why he would live there, so far from Ironforge.  The humans must pay him a king's ransom to keep him there! So, if you want to travel and don't mind making some money, then will you send Furen my request for a shield? "
2546,Vyrin's Revenge,Kill Ol' Sooty then show your handiwork to Daryl the Youngling at the Farstrider Lodge. ,"I don't suppose you'd be interested in a little payback for His Boldness? Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say. A year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him. All he had to show for his effort was that ugly scar over his eye. Kill the bear, and I'm sure even Daryl would be speechless for once. The bear, Ol' Sooty, can be found around his lair in the hills over Thelsamar. "
2547,Bingles' Missing Supplies,"Find and return Bingles' supplies: Bingles' Wrench, Bingles' Screwdriver, Bingles' Hammer, and Bingles' Blastencapper. ","As if crashing into the Loch wasn't bad enough, troggs from the nearby island attacked me and stole my tools and special Blastenheimer Blastencapper explosives. With no gyrocopter and no explosives, the movement has no chance! Get my tools back and find my Blastencapper explosives, <name>. For Gnomeregan! "
2548,A Dark Threat Looms,"Chief Engineer Hinderweir wants you to take the strange smelling powder to Ashlan Stonesmirk, the explosives expert at Dun Modr in the Wetlands. ","If my suspicions are correct, this is some type of explosive powder.  This must be analyzed by an explosives expert so we know just what we're dealing with here. Ashlan Stonesmirk was assigned to the regiment guarding Dun Modr and the Thandol Span.  I need you to make a grave and perilous journey, <name>. Travel through the Algaz Gate, follow the road through the Wetlands and seek out Stonesmirk in Dun Modr.  Heed my advice: stick to the roads and stop for nothing! "
2549,Filthy Paws,Go to the Silver Stream Mine and collect 4 loads of Miners' Gear. ,"The Silver Stream Mine to the east ran dry long ago.  It was converted by the Miners' League into a storage depot, but now Kobolds have moved in, putting their filthy paws on good, Dwarven tools! We'll root out those vermin soon enough, but the League wants someone to get their gear out of the mine before we warriors tromp in there and break things.  It'll be a tough delve - you might want cohorts at your side. The gear is stored in Miners' League Crates throughout the mine.  Good luck. "
2550,A Dark Threat Looms,Ashlan Stonesmirk wants you to return to Chief Engineer Hinderweir in Loch Modan and inform him of the new discovery. ,"This ain't no ordinary blast powder.  Look at the tiny silver crystals.  And the distinct smell!  Why it's clear as daylight that this is Seaforium Powder.  Seaforium is harmless enough.  But once it's wet it could blow Ironforge out of the mountain. The chemical reaction can be defused by mixing four components:  lurker venom, crushed Mo'Grosh crystal, a crocolisk tear and this disarming colloid.  Now tell Hinderweir before it's too late! "
2551,Resupplying the Excavation,Speak with Huldar. ,"It's not too late though, you're welcome to go look for Huldar. He can't have made it very far, strong as they are, Miran and Saean can only move so fast laden down with those barrels. They're taking the normal route to the site, leaving south out of town and following the curve of the Loch. Shouldn't have a problem finding them unless they've already gotten there. "
2552,Mountaineer Stormpike's Task,Speak with Mountaineer Stormpike. ,"I hear Mountaineer Stormpike is looking for a runner.  Someone to do a little traveling for him.  How about it?  Are you the <race> for the job? If so, then you'll find Stormpike at the top of the northern guard tower. "
2553,In Defense of the King's Lands,Mountaineer Cobbleflint of the southern guard tower wants you to kill 10 Stonesplinter Troggs and 10 Stonesplinter Scouts. ,"We need to protect the Loch, <name>!  With so many of the King's soldiers fighting valiantly on remote battlefields, we've become overwhelmed on the home front.  Troggs are tunneling up from every crevice!  The Trogg infestation poses the largest threat to Ironforge.  These disgusting mutants must be destroyed. We need you, brave adventurer, to venture forth and lay waste to the Trogg threat.  Slay 10 Stonesplinter Troggs and 10 Stonesplinter Scouts and report back. "
2554,Powder to Ironband,Speak with Jern Hornhelm at Thelsamar in Loch Modan. ,"If Ironband still needs blastpowder, then by Magni he'll have it!  I sent the approval on ahead with a messenger to Jern Hornhelm in Thelsamar.  He'll prepare the powder and other supplies to take to Ironband. And one more thing: I want you to personally see that the shipment of powder reaches its destination.  The last one didn't, so keep your mind sharp and your eyes open. "
2555,Report to Ironforge,Take Ironband's Progress Report to Prospector Stormpike. ,"We'll need approval to get Ironband more blastpowder. You'll have to take his report to the Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge. Here's the report. Give it to Prospector Stormpike, and don't forget to duck after you deliver it. Stormpike is hotheaded, and he won't be happy to hear of Ironband's slow progress at the site. You'll find Stormpike in the Assembly of Explorers. "
2556,Mercenaries,"Magistrate Bluntnose of Thelsamar has hired you to kill 4 Mo'grosh Ogres, 4 Mo'grosh Brutes and 4 Mo'grosh Enforcers. ","Two months just to hear from Ironforge that we'll be spared a handful of soldiers for our own defense, and another two months until they arrive! Bad enough that our town goes unprotected, but the excavation and the dam--the dam! --are open to attacks as well. I've no choice then, it seems. I'll need hired arms. How about you?

I'm sure they're somewhere near Maltorius, deep inside the Slag Pit. "
2626,Prayer to Elune,Find the Prayer to Elune and take it to Astarii Starseeker in Darnassus. ,"Will you assist me, mortal? Will you find the prayer to Elune? As I stated, the prayer was etched onto a golden tablet. One of these idol worshipping scoundrels must have it on their person. If you do recover my prayer, take it to Astarii Starseeker in Darnassus. It matters little that my faith has been rekindled after the countless malevolent actions that I have taken against this world and its inhabitants, but my prayer must be heard. Absolution is the last thing I expect. "

While the four towers can never be destroyed, you can use the torch of retribution to set them ablaze for a very long period of time: A fire that no element or force can subdue.

Ye see, the climate out here combined with the lack o' air pressure makes me fingers expand. They're like gigantic Thelsamar Blood Sausages, they are. . . Ye're gonna have to carry out me orders of business and what have ye. First on me agenda: Poundin' the livin' daylights out o' the heavy war golems o' the Gorge. Get crackin'. "

","I have received reports that a group of undead are holing up to prepare for an attack against us.

They are reported to be hiding in a location known as Beren's Peril. The exact location is unknown, but it appears to be a cave in the hills, near a pocket of Dalaran wizards. I trust your resourcefulness. Find them, and put them down. "
2655,Resting in Pieces,Bring Alaric's Head to his grave. ,"You don't look like a rot hide.  Good.  I had lost hope. . . My name is Alaric, and I was once Thule's head servant and bodyguard.

And after creating the cursed rot hide gnolls, Thule beheaded me. . . and gave my head to the gnolls as a plaything! Please, take me to my body.  I believe the gnolls buried it here in Fenris Keep, near the stable, in an unmarked grave. "
2656,Pyrewood Ambush,Help Deathstalker Faerleia kill the Pyrewood Council. ,"You got here just in the nick of time, <name>! The Pyrewood Council will be returning any moment.  Arugal has other matters to tend to in the keep.  He uses the Council as mere puppets to keep the mindless minions of Pyrewood under his control.  But I believe that without the guidance of the Pyrewood Council, the sons of Arugal will turn against their master. I cannot handle them all by myself.  I need you to help me.  Together we can lay waste to the Council for Lady Sylvanas. "
2657,Wand to Bethor,Take the Woven Wand to Bethor Iceshard in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity. ,"Thule once told me that, long ago, he and two colleagues created a magic wand, woven together from the apprentice wands each mage possessed.  This wand was a symbol of their friendship, and although Thule came to despise it he could not part with it, nor could he let the others have it.  So he stole the wand, and hid it in Fenris Keep. Here.  Take the wand to Bethor Iceshard, one of Thule's friends from years past.  I'm sure he will want it. "
2658,The Hidden Niche,Take Alaric to the hidden alcove. ,"I know of a hidden niche within the keep that holds an item dear to Thule, and his old colleagues.  It also holds something you might find useful.  Take me there! The alcove is in the southwestern tower of the keep, behind a dusty shelf. Take my body, but leave my boots.  They never fit me anyway. . . "

",According to Berard's Journal the moss from Lake Skulkers and Creepers might prove useful for our quest to brew a new plague.  Those beasts dwell on the islands in Lake Lordamere to the east. He also mentions a very rare Hardened Tumor that he discovered on a Vile Fin murloc.  Apparently the tumor is so rare Berard was only able to obtain one. Collect samples of the moss as well as the rare Hardened Tumor and take them to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity. 
2661,A Husband's Revenge,Kill Valdred Moray. ,"Valdred, once my good friend, was my wife's murderer.  Although I am incapable of grieving, I do yearn for revenge.

2662,Ivar the Foul,"Kill Ivar the Foul, and bring Ivar's Head to Rane Yorick at the Ivar Patch. ","My brother Quinn and I were tasked to recon Silverpine Forest and report to High Executor Hadrec.  But we didn't get far -- when moving through this farm we were attacked by the ghoul Ivar the Foul. We escaped from Ivar, but he seriously mauled Quinn.  He's healing from the potion you gave him, but Ivar may return before Quinn recovers. Kill Ivar so Quinn will have time to heal.  Ivar is usually in the barn yonder, waiting for my guard to drop. "
2663,Escorting Erland,"Escort Erland through the wolves, to Rane Yorick. ","The wolves outside won't leave, and they eye me evilly every time I step foot out that door.  They must be incredibly hungry to think I'm worth eating. I have to report to my teammate, the Deathstalker Rane Yorick.  And to get to Rane, I'll need help against those wolves. Please escort me!  And there are a lot of wolves out there, so we'll have a better chance if you have friends who can help. . . "
2664,The Engraved Ring,Bring Deliah's Ring to Magistrate Sevren in Brill. ,"If you want to find the husband or beloved who gave Deliah her ring. . . then speak with Magistrate Sevren in Brill.  He should have records of recent deaths and, with luck, can discover who Deliah is. But I wouldn't hope.  Whoever gave her the ring is probably dead.  Or if he's undead he probably no longer cares about Deliah. "
2665,The Weaver,"Kill the Dalaran archmage, then retrieve his staff for Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher. ","An archmage of great power is overseeing the reactivation of the ley energy node. With the progress they have made, our only hope of stopping them is by killing him. It will be difficult, he is no doubt protected by many other mages and warders. You must go, and you must dispatch him quickly. When he is dead, retrieve his staff for me. Go now. "
2666,Arugal's Folly,Bring 6 Pyrewood Shackles to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher. ,"As my understanding of Arugal's magic grows so does my disdain for the hapless fool.  I am close to completing my research on his so called remedy. My knowledge will be complete when I learn what enchantment is causing the strange behavior going on in Pyrewood Village.  By day, the peasants appear to be Human.  But when the sun goes down the townsfolk turn into Moonrage Worgen. I need to draw energy from the enchanted shackles Arugal cast on them.  Bring to me six enchanted Pyrewood Shackles, <name>. "
2667,Lost Deathstalkers,Find the Deathstalkers Quinn and Rane Yorick. ,"A couple weeks ago two of our Deathstalkers, Rane and Quinn Yorick, were sent on a reconnaissance mission through northern Silverpine.  We have not heard from them. They may have become victim to the Scourge, though if that is true then I want it confirmed.  Find these Deathstalkers. Their first objective was to scout the farms in northern Silverpine.  You should begin your search there. "
2668,Wild Hearts,Gather 6 discolored worg hearts and bring them to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher. ,"My brother Quinn was badly hurt by the ghoul, Ivar the Foul, and I don't know if he will heal properly without magical aid.  Although I am not an apothecary, I do know that our apothecaries can make healing potions from the discolored hearts of worgs. Gather such hearts and take them to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher to the south.  Then return here with the potion. You can find plenty of worgs between here and Malden's Orchard to the east. "
2669,Arugal's Folly,Retrieve the Remedy of Arugal for Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher. ,How Arugal gained acceptance within the Kirin Tor is beyond me.  His spell-casting knowledge seemed as transparent as a blown glass bauble. What's important now is learning exactly what magic Arugal used so that I can turn it against him and secure Silverpine Forest for the Dark Lady. Arugal first stayed at the wheat farm just north of the bridge.  One of the Deathstalkers reported seeing some spellbooks but could not secure them.  Retrieve for me the spell labeled Remedy of Arugal from those books. 
2670,Rot Hide Ichor,Bring 8 bottles of rot hide ichor to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher. ,"Before we launch an assault on Fenris Isle, we must determine who is behind the rot hide gnolls.  Our apothecaries believe their origin lies within the strange fluid that flows through their bodies. Go to Fenris Isle, east of the Decrepit Ferry, and collect rot hide ichor from the gnolls you find there.  Bring it to Apothecary Renferrel, stationed outside the Sepulcher. "
2671,The Dead Fields,Kill rot hide gnolls at the Dead Fields. ,"Our initial scouting reports of Silverpine show the rot hides have a base at an old farm to the north, the Dead Fields.  We have sent small assaults against them, but each time they are reinforced by the banshee Nightlash, who uses her magic to rout our forces. We want Nightlash destroyed. Go to the Dead Fields and assault the rot hides.  If you don't see Nightlash then kill the rot hides until she appears, then defeat her. Her essence will turn to dust.  Bring me that dust as proof. "
2672,Ambermill Investigations,Obtain 8 Dalaran Pendants for Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher. ,"Dalar is attempting to locate the source of the wizards' spellcasting. For now, we'll have to slow their progress in any way we can. . . The conjurers, mages and protectors are no doubt carrying the pendants. Remove and retrieve them. Take the main road south and the eastern fork into Ambermill. "
2673,Thule Ravenclaw,Bring Bethor's Scroll to Apothecary Renferrel at the Silverpine Sepulcher. ,"This Ichor was crafted by an old colleague of mine: Thule Ravenclaw.  He was a young, promising mage before the great war, but when the Lich King rose to power, he betrayed his brethren and allied with the Scourge. I did not realize he still lives, nor that he leads the Rot Hides in their forays against us! I know many of his spells, and can help concoct a potion to counter them.  Take this scroll back to Apothecary Renferrel.  It has the incantations needed for the potion. "
2674,Raleigh and the Undercity,Bring Deliah's Ring to Raleigh. ,"Deliah had a husband, Raleigh, who now dwells in the Undercity.  If the Deliah who lived in Brill is the one who owned this ring, then Raleigh will know. Raleigh is in the Trade Quarter of the Undercity. "
2675,A Recipe For Death,Retrieve Apothecary Berard's journal from Pyrewood Village and take it to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher. ,"You can be of further service to the Royal Apothecary Society, <name>. When Arugal cast his wretched magic on the forest, he cursed one of our most promising members, Apothecary Berard.  Now a mindless servant of Arugal, Berard is useless to us.  But his findings might prove to be of worth.  He was studying an ancient plague that killed off all the aquatic life in Lake Lordamere ages ago. Retrieve Berard's Journal from his study in the Pyrewood Village Inn and take it to Apothecary Renferrel. "
2676,Journey to Hillsbrad Foothills,Deliver Apothecary Renferrel's findings to Apothecary Lydon in the town of Tarren Mill in the Hillsbrad Foothills. ,"The Royal Apothecary Society is under extreme pressure from the Dark Lady to develop a New Plague.  We are working diligently and have made much progress.  It is our belief that the success will be achieved much faster if we share information amongst the Society. For that reason I want you to deliver my latest findings to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill, a small town nestled in the Hillsbrad Foothills.  The journey will be a long one. Head south and stick to the roads.  Follow the signs closely! "
2677,Arugal's Folly,Kill Grimson the Pale and bring his head to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher. ,"It will indeed take me longer than I had thought to uncover the dark secrets behind the enchantments Arugal was using. But in the meantime I need you to take care of a slight problem our Darkstalkers have discovered.  It seems that Arugal let his magic spread to the Deep Elem Mine in the hills to the southeast. The mine would prove to be quite a resource for Varimathras's advance. I want you to behead the tainted foreman of the mine, Grimson the Pale.  With his death, the mine shall be ours. "
2678,Return to Quinn,"Bring Quinn's potion to Quinn Yorick at the Ivar Patch, north of the Sepulcher. ","Here is the potion to aid in Quinn Yorick 's recovery. Now if you will excuse me, I have very important work to continue. . . "
2679,Prove Your Worth,Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher wants you to kill 5 Moonrage Whitescalps. ,"Lady Sylvanas has charged Varimathras with the conquering of the human and dwarven lands to the south. But that fool, Arugal -- charlatan of Dalaran and now cursed beast of Shadowfang Keep -- let his reckless magic wreak havoc with the strategic stronghold of Silverpine Forest. I need someone skilled in the ways of combat to help clean up Arugal's mess.  Prove yourself to me by killing 5 Moonrage Whitescalps.  The wretched beasts can often be found just off the road, down the hill below. "
2680,A Recipe For Death,Collect 6 Grizzled Bear Hearts and 6 samples of Skittering Blood and deliver them to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity. ,Arthas's numbers are overwhelming. But with a New Plague we could eradicate both the Scourge Army and the Human infestation once and for all. My studies have proven that spider blood combined with a toxin derived from a grizzled bear heart results in a deadly elixir. Collect samples from the spiders in the Skittering Dark to the northwest and from the bears wandering throughout Silverpine Forest. Deliver the reagents to Master Apothecary Faranell of the Royal Apothecary Society in the Undercity. 
2681,Border Crossings,Retrieve the contents of one of the Dalaran wizards' crates. ,"As you may know, the town of Ambermill remains a source of human opposition, mainly through the support they receive from the wizards of Dalaran. I don't know what their plan is, but for them to show interest in a backwater village like Ambermill indicates that it must have some greater importance. They've been shipping crates by the wagon from Hillsbrad. Many of those supplies end up at a small camp north of Pyrewood Village. Retrieve the contents of a crate and return them to me. "
2682,Rot Hide Clues,Bring Deliah's Ring to High Executor Hadrec at the Sepulcher. ,"Among the corpses a hand protrudes, unwrapped.  It is the hand of a woman, pockmarked from the plague but relatively fresh. On the hand is a ring.  Removing the ring and inspecting it reveals an engraving: ""For Deliah"""
2683,Supplying the Sepulcher,Bring Podrig's Order to Karos Razok. ,"Executor Hadrec asked me to take stock of our equipment at the Sepulcher.  With the Scourge, and worse, lurking in the woods, he doesn't want the Deathguards to lack gear they might need. I found that we are, in general, well stocked, but we do need more weapons to replace those lost in the field. Here is a requisition order of what is needed, for the weapon dealer Gordon Wendham in the Undercity.  Take the order to our bat master, Karos Razok, and speak with him about transport to the Undercity. "
2684,The Deathstalkers' Report,Bring the Deathstalker Report to High Executor Hadrec at the Sepulcher. ,"Although Quinn's wounds are mending, I want to get our report to High Executor Hadrec as quickly as possible.  It has information that is vital to the Forsaken's occupation of Silverpine. "
2685,Return to Podrig,"Buy a bat ride to the Sepulcher from the bat master Michael Garrett, then bring Gordon's Crate to Deathguard Podrig in the Sepulcher. ","The bat master in the Sepulcher is Karos Razok.  If you have already met him, then I can give you a bat to fly back to him. Our bats will always fly to the Undercity, but to travel to more remote locales their rider must first visit the area and speak with its bat master. You have met Karos in the Sepulcher, so you may now fly bats there.  Speak with me again when you are ready. "
2686,Arugal's Folly,Bring 6 Glutton Shackles and 3 Darksoul Shackles to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher. ,After examining Arugal's work my worst suspicions were confirmed.  The old hack was not qualified to clean chamber pots in Dalaran let alone represent the Kirin Tor in its most dire hour.  Fools! Arugal used enchanted items to reinforce his weak magic.  I need to examine these items first hand.  Travel forth and slay Moonrage Gluttons and Moonrage Darksouls until you have collected enough of their enchanted shackles for my research.  The foul creatures have been seen to the north and east. 
2687,Delivery to the Sepulcher,Deliver the Sealed Sin'dorei Orders to Advisor Sorrelon at the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest. ,"You have stirred the lady's heart, though it no longer beats. However, I have instructions that must be delivered to the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest. Advisor Sorrelon represents us to the Forsaken there. The shortest route, barring the use of their flying bats, is to leave Undercity and take the road south.  Follow the signposts.  Finding the place shouldn't be difficult.  Brace yourself, though; the Sepulcher itself is a dilapidated crypt. These Forsaken are certainly odd creatures. "
2688,Speak with Renferrel,Speak with Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher. ,"While you were out helping our deathstalkers, Apothecary Renferrel sent you a summons.  He did not give me details, but he wanted to speak with you about the wolf hearts you had given him. "
2689,The Decrepit Ferry,Go to the Decrepit Ferry. ,"<name>, we've discovered a new hive for the Scourge: the Decrepit Ferry.  The ferry lies east of the Sepulcher, and is heavily patrolled by rot hides and other undead. There must be a reason for the Scourge's occupation of the area.  Go to the Decrepit Ferry and find out why the Scourge are there. "
2690,Rot Hide Origins,Bring the Sample Ichor to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity. ,"I have reduced the ichor you brought me and separated it into its base components.  My findings are not conclusive, but I have determined that warlock and necromantic magics were used in the ichor's creation. While I continue to study the ichor, I want you to take a sample to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity.  Bethor is not an apothecary, but his knowledge of magic may help to unravel the mystery of the rot hides. Go.  You will find Bethor in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity. "
2691,Report to Hadrec,Report to High Executor Hadrec at the Sepulcher. ,"Before you launch an assault on Fenris Isle, report to High Executor Hadrec.  He may have additional information or equipment you'll need. "
2692,Michael Garrett,Bring Gordon's Crate to Michael Garrett. ,"I have placed the Sepulcher's supplies into this crate.  If you have already visited the Sepulcher and spoken with their bat master, then you may ride a bat back to him. Speak with the Undercity's bat master, Michael Garrett.  He can provide you with a bat to the Sepulcher. "
2693,Maps and Runes,Bring the strange pendant to Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher. ,<You quickly remove the pendant from the crate and replace the lid. >
2694,Dalaran's Intentions,Speak with Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher. ,"Of course! How could I have forgotten? Ambermill was one of the sites earmarked by the Kirin Tor, noted because it houses a dormant ley energy node. The wizards must be planning to reactivate the node and use its energies for some greater purpose. We cannot allow this to happen. . . It will take a great amount of power to activate the area's ley energies, we can stall them by taking the pendants away from the wizards. Relay this information to Allister, he will decide a course of action. "
2695,Ride to the Undercity,"Buy a bat ride to the Undercity from the bat master Karos Razok, then take Podrig's Order to Gordon Wendham in the Undercity. ","One of my bats can take you to the Undercity, for a small fee.  Speak with me again when you are ready so that we may arrange your transport. You will find Gordon Wendham in the Trade Quarter of the Undercity.  That is the same quarter where my bat will land. "
2696,Dalar's Analysis,Take the rune-inscribed pendant to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher. ,"Take the pendant to Dalar Dawnweaver, perhaps he can shed some light on the wizards' plans. "

I believe you should be the one to deliver it to him, along with an account of your findings. Do not worry, there is no doubt that he will commend you for doing your duty to the people of Stormwind. Your audience is scheduled soon, so you'd best hurry, it's a bit of a ways to Stormwind Keep. "
2698,The Attack! ,Remain in the garden until Lord Gregor Lescovar and Marzon the Silent Blade have had their conversation. ,"After I put on Spybot's disguise, he'll head in to talk to Lescovar. The guards should let him pass no problem. While you were getting materials for me, I took care of informing Marzon that it was time for him and Lescovar to meet again. I even dropped some false information. Lescovar will dismiss his guards and wait for Marzon out here in the garden. After you catch wind of talk about the Defias, make your move. You need to kill them both before the guards return! When you're done, speak to Trias. "
2699,The Unsent Letter,Deliver the Letter to the City Architect to Baros Alexston in Stormwind. ,"Searching Edwin VanCleef's person, you discover, among other things, an unsent letter. It is addressed to Baros Alexston, the City Architect of Stormwind, City Hall, Cathedral Square. It appears to be recently written and sealed. "
2700,Items of Some Consequence,Bring 3 Silk Cloth and 2 of Clara's Fresh Apples to Tyrion in Stormwind. ,"Trias wants the timetable pushed up some, huh? Okay, we can do that, but I'm not ready. And know this, I'm doing the hard part, but you're the one that's going to get <his/her> hands dirty, understand? Good. Okay, I'll need you to get me a few things before I can put my plan into effect. I got the perfect disguise that'll get Spybot past those guards. Bring me some silk and a couple apples. The silk's up to you, but Clara's little farm right outside the city has the perfect sized apples. "
2701,Rethban Ore,Gather 5 loads of Rethban Ore and bring it to Brother Paxton in the Northshire Library. ,"Rethban Ore is named after the man who first found it, Bart Rethban.  When smelted it's not as strong as iron, but its ore has a dark, flat color that some scribes use in their dyes.  It can be found in the Rethban Caverns, north of here. We usually have some in stock, but we're too busy preparing for Orc attacks to gather any.  And besides. . . Redridge Gnolls are now living in the Rethban Caverns and their Drudgers are gathering the ore themselves. So if you need some, you'll have to get it yourself. "
2702,A Noble Brew,Zardeth the Black Claw wants you to bring him a Tear of Tilloa from Darkshire and a Musquash Root from the Wetlands. ,"Lord Wishock is causing quite a stir amongst the House of Nobles.  He was made aware of our little ""establishment"" down here and is lobbying for a full investigation.  I have a plan to keep Wishock ""preoccupied, "" but I'll need your help. There is a flower growing in the Garden of Stalvan on the outskirts of Darkshire.  This small white flower is known as the Tear of Tilloa.  I will also need a Musquash Root, found only at the very base of the falls far beneath the Stonewrought Dam in the Wetlands. "
2703,A Most Puzzling Circumstance,Take the Head of Onyxia to Zardeth of the Black Claw in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb. ,You have accomplished the truly impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Seize her head and deliver it to Zardeth of the Black Claw. 
2704,Return to Kristoff,Return to Brother Kristoff in the Cathedral Square. ,"Now that I've finished copying the book, here's the original Stresses of Iron.  Thank you for your patience, and if you see Milton please tell him I'm sorry for the long delay. "
2705,Preserving Knowledge,Bring 5 Recovered Tomes and the Worn Leather Book containing The Arm of Gri'lek to Loremaster Dibbs in Southshore. ,"Those beastly ogres now reside within Alterac's ruins, and I shudder to think what they're doing with the precious books still there.  You must recover what you can! Enter the Ruins of Alterac and search for tomes looted by the ogres.  Get whatever you can find and bring them to me, but also seek out one book in particular: The Arm of Gri'lek.  It contains ancient troll lore that I must learn, and the Ruins of Alterac was the last known location of an intact copy of this book. "
2706,Southshore,Speak with Loremaster Dibbs in Southshore. ,"<name>.  If you don't mind a long journey then I have a task for you, to again help Stormwind fill its library. The old kingdom of Alterac fell after the great war, and it had a large collection of books.  It's a tragedy that the city is ruined, but even more tragic is all of their knowledge lost!  We must recover what we can. Southshore is the closest town to the Ruins of Alterac.  Go there and speak with Loremaster Dibbs.  He can direct you to the ruins, and to what books may be found there. "
2707,Speaking of Fortitude,Go to the Royal Library in Stormwind Keep and speak with Milton Sheaf. ,"I'm giving a speech on the Fortitude of the Spirit, and I'd like to recite passages from a particular book on metallurgy - ""The Stresses of Iron. ""  A copy of this book should be in the Royal Library, within Stormwind Keep.  Can you retrieve it for me?  If so, then may the blessings of the Light be with you! The Royal Library is very large, but the head librarian, Milton Sheaf, knows each shelf like it was his own son.  Speak to him, he'll retrieve the book for you. "
2708,The Perenolde Tiara,Bring the Perenolde Tiara to Remington Ridgewell in Stormwind. ,"The Perenolde Tiara is an old heirloom of the Perenolde ""nobles"" - the ruling family of Alterac before that kingdom fell to ruin.  It is said to have been crafted by master jewelers in Ironforge, and fitted with the finest of emeralds. When Alterac was destroyed the Tiara was lost, but there are rumors that an Ogre Mage, Grel'borg the Miser, found the tiara and now wanders the Ruins of Alterac searching for more treasures. We would have you acquire the tiara for us. "
2709,Infiltrating the Castle,Speak to Tyrion in Stormwind Castle. ,"Hmm, an interesting tale, and not one to be taken lightly. Yeah, I can help you, but what you need to do is divvy out a form of justice that's not. . . legal, if you're to see this through to the end. Lescovar and Marzon need to be dealt with, and swiftly. Do you think you're capable of such a thing? You decide. If so, then make haste to the castle and find an old friend of mine, a gnome named Tyrion. He's been watching Lescovar now for a couple weeks. He should be able to help you end this. "
2710,The Missing Diplomat,"Subdue Tapoke Jahn before he escapes, and then return to Mikhail in Menethil. ","You say Elling sent you here? Well then, the hospitality I expressed is now tenfold. Anything you need, just ask. I will do my best to aid you. Hmm, Slim, you say? Not sure the name sounds familiar, but I'll keep my eyes out for him. Don't look now, <name>, but the gentleman over by the exit is looking over here. He's listening to our conversation a little too intently if you catch my meaning? If I were you, I'd do what you can to subdue him before he makes a break for the door. "
2711,Brother Paxton,Speak with Brother Paxton in the Northshire Abbey. ,"The Stresses of Iron?  Yes, I know the book.  Quite a good one, written by the Dwarven miner Margulf Blaggon a few decades ago.  He spent most his time deep in the mountains of Khaz Modan, digging ore.  Smart fellow! But where was I?  Oh yes, the Stresses of Iron!  I'm afraid the book was moved to the Northshire Abbey.  The caretaker of the Abbey's library, Brother Paxton, wanted to make a copy of the book for his own shelves. But that was months ago.  I wonder why it's taking him so long. . . "
2712,Bazil Thredd,Speak with Warden Thelwater in the Stockade. ,"VanCleef and I were members of the Stonemasons Guild. Our main project was to rebuild Stormwind after the War. When we had finished our duties, we were cheated. The nobles refused to pay us for our work. Some of the more senior of the Stonemasons were offered governmental jobs, but VanCleef refused it out of loyalty to all the Stonemasons. He led a riot and left the city, swearing revenge. His lieutenant, Bazil Thredd, might know more about VanCleef's plans. He's being held prisoner in the Stockade. "
2713,James Hyal,Speak with Vincent Hyal in Menethil Harbor. ,"Before working here at the Blue Recluse, I was trained by one of the best chefs and innkeepers I'd ever met. His name was James Hyal. Everything I have and everywhere I've gotten in life is thanks to him. I wonder how he's doing. His brother Vincent and he went to work in a tavern in Menethil Harbor, but I haven't heard from him recently. If you ever happen to be headed in that direction, maybe you could say hello to him for me? "
2714,Humble Beginnings,"Go to Baros Alexston's house in Westfall and search for his compass, then return it to him in Cathedral Square of Stormwind. ","It seems an eternity since I was a boy working the farm in Westfall. They say you can never go back, and it's true. Doubly true in my case, my family's home has been burned down and taken over by thieves. I have spoken with my father about the fate of some of my possessions, including my first compass. He was unable to save them. However, he also says that they should be hidden away on the farm. You'll find the Alexston Farmstead west of Sentinel Hill. Perhaps you could go and retrieve it for me? "
2715,The Corruption Abroad,Travel to Gershala Nightwhisper in Auberdine. ,"Stormwind -- such a bustling hub of activity. I have traveled from afar to seek help. Often it is heard that brave adventurers roam these city streets. My brother, Gershala, requires assistance in Darkshore. He resides in the seaside town of Auberdine. The journey is a long and epic one. It is for this reason that I ask the help of a seasoned <class> such as yourself. "
2716,The Missing Diplomat,Find Bishop DeLavey in Stormwind Keep. ,"Excuse me, <sir/madam>. Bishop DeLavey asked me to approach adventurers that might be able to help him with a delicate matter. If you could quietly head to Stormwind Keep and speak to him at your earliest convenience, I'm sure he would appreciate your help. Again, please be discreet. It is a matter of some importance. "
2717,The First and the Last,Speak with Mathias Shaw in Old Town Stormwind. ,"Nathanos Marris was the first and last of the human ranger lords. A disciple of Sylvanas Windrunner, now the Banshee Queen of the Forsaken. We had thought that Nathanos had been killed in action in the defense of Lordaeron five years ago. Although his corpse was never recovered, it was assumed that he did not make it out of the Eastern Plaguelands. Mathias Shaw has been investigating the disappearance and may have some new information. Report to him at once. He resides in Old Town, at the Barracks. "
2718,The Curious Visitor,Bring the Sealed Description of Thredd's Visitor to Baros Alexston in Stormwind. ,"During the first years of Thredd's imprisonment, he never had any visitors. I figured that he was no longer of use to the Brotherhood, so they abandoned him. Anyway, a few months ago, that all changed; he started to get regular visits. . . once, maybe twice a week. It was a strange man--the quiet type. I had my suspicions, but all his papers checked out. His documents claimed his name was Maelik; here's his description. I don't think he'll be coming to visit Thredd anymore. "
2719,The Head of the Beast,Speak to Mathias Shaw in Stormwind. ,"Find Shaw in Old Town. Let him know that the Lescovar threat has been dealt with and about your involvement in the Lord's plots against the city. I'm sure he'll be proud to have another hero among Stormwind's citizens. He'll more than likely send you off to meet with the Prince or some other noble. Don't let it get to your head, <name>. The nobles can think they rule the city all they want, but some things remain out of their hands. "
2720,A Donation of Runecloth,"&lt; name&gt; , you've been a tremendous contributor to our cloth drive. ","Fantastic - these will go right to use, I assure you.  Thank you again for your assistance!  We'd certainly be lost without you. With all the donations you've made, I would certainly process any additional runecloth donations you care to make in the future.  Just be sure to check in with me, and I'll personally make sure that your good deeds won't go unrecognized! "
2721,Mazen's Behest,Retrieve Khadgar's Essays on Dimensional Convergence and deliver them to Watcher Mahar Ba in Nethergarde Keep. ,"Master Mazen's directions were quite clear: Deliver a very important essay to Watcher Mahar Ba in Nethergarde Keep. But I had never been to the Blasted Lands before! The journey was frightening! When I got to the Swamp of Sorrows, I made a wrong turn and ended up surrounded by horrible plant-like swamp creatures. They lurched as if to attack me so I ran. But in my haste I dropped the essay. One of the beasts took it I am sure. Could you please try to retrieve it and deliver it to Mahar Ba? "
2722,Shadow of the Past,Bring the Sealed Description of Thredd's Visitor to Master Mathias Shaw in Stormwind. ,"I really haven't a clue, <name>. There is someone else who might be able to help you, and it so happens that he owes me a favor for--well, let's not get into that. Master Mathias Shaw of SI: 7 can be found in the barracks in Old Town. Shaw has his thumb on most of the shady, or underhanded dealings of the city. If anyone knows, it'd be him. "
2723,Look to an Old Friend,Speak to Elling Trias in Stormwind. ,"That Marzon would be contacting a member of the Defias and have ties to Lescovar. . . Having killed VanCleef and Thredd, it would be hard to see Lescovar brought to proper justice, as your evidence is nothing without their testimonies. That is not even considering the fact that Lescovar is a noble and well connected. It effectively makes him above the law. You'll need other help. I loathe to do so, but there is someone I know that will aid us. You'll find Trias in the Trade District of the city. "
2724,Brotherhood's End,Speak with Baros Alexston in Stormwind. ,"Ah, I almost forgot. Alexston came while you were away, he wished to speak with you. No doubt he wishes to report the goings-on of the Defias Brotherhood to the nobles. A bit of advice, <name>: if anyone should ask, I would provide all details but that it was your hand that slew Lescovar. Trust me. I am. . . acquainted. . . with the ways of such things. And as far as Trias goes, well, speak to no one of him. . . ever. . . if you can help it. "
2725,The Missing Diplomat,Speak to Mikhail in the Wetlands. ,"A contact of mine retired in the Wetlands at the harbor city of Menethil. He should be willing to help on your word alone if you tell him you're working for me. His name is Mikhail. He mentioned becoming a bartender before leaving Stormwind a few years ago. Speak to him, find this Slim, and find out if there's anything else to know about this kidnapped diplomat. We need to find out where they've taken him, or at least who he is. The docket doesn't mention anything about their plans after he's captured. "
2726,A Noble Brew,Take the Black Claw Stout to Lord Wishock in the Hall of Petitioners. ,"Lord Wishock, like all men, has his weaknesses.  His happens to be a fondness for liquor.  The hypocrisy is astounding.  The trite fool spends his days trying to shut down our little ""tavern"" while his nights are spent upstairs, running up a bill he never pays.  Well, let's see how Wishock likes this special brew I have prepared for him: Black Claw stout.  It's got quite a kick, <name>. Take it to him and see how he likes it.  Most likely the old fool is milling about the Hall of Petitioners. "
2727,Stormpike's Delivery,Deliver the Package for Stormpike to Mountaineer Stormpike in Loch Modan. ,"The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes.  So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of Ironforge, commissioned me to craft him a weapon. The weapon is finished, but. . . Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan.  If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him? My last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern guard tower in Loch Modan. "
2728,To The Hinterlands,Speak with High Thane Falstad Wildhammer at Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands. ,"As I mentioned earlier, I attempted to scout the temple on my own from the air. Well, I wasn't exactly alone. I traveled to the renowned gryphon aviary at Aerie Peak in The Hinterlands. There I enlisted the aid of one of their finest pilots. The pilot fell off his mount, down into the swamp. . . In my old age the poor fellow's name eludes me. The master of the aviary would remember, no doubt. Journey there and seek out Falstad Wildhammer. We need to find out what happened to that pilot. "
2729,Elmore's Task,Speak with Grimand Elmore in Stormwind. ,"There's a dwarven weaponsmith in Stormwind, Grimand Elmore, who sent word that he needs help with a delivery.  I believe he wants a package sent to his homeland in the north. You have a sturdy pair on you!  So if you're interested in some legwork then speak with Grimand.  We could use you down here, but we must also keep our ties strong with the dwarves. You can find Grimand Elmore at the weapon shop in the Dwarven District of Stormwind, in the northeast section of town. "
2730,The Missing Diplomat,Find the Defias Docket and return it to Watcher Backus in Duskwood. ,"Defias activity? Well, there's always some activity; even if they keep to themselves we consider them a threat. But now that I think about it, there was a recent sighting that seemed odd. It must have been a couple weeks ago, but some of their agents had gathered around Addle's Stead. From the report, I'd guessed something big went down. Why don't you check there first and bring me back anything you find? The farmstead is south of the road from Westfall just as you enter Duskwood. "
2731,Return to Milton,Bring the Tomes of Alterac to Milton Sheaf in Stormwind. ,"I need to spend some time studying the Arm of Gri'lek book you brought me, though I'm sure Milton is eager to get the other recovered books into Stormwind's collection. Here are the books you gathered from the Ruins of Alterac, packed and catalogued.  Take them back to Milton Sheaf in Stormwind and I'm sure he'll be grateful. "
2732,Ink Supplies,Speak with Foreman Oslow in Lakeshire and ask him for Rethban Iron Ore. ,"I've been meaning to finish my copy of The Stresses of Iron, but. . . Well you see, I make my own ink for books I copy.  It's my own recipe; it doesn't run or smear, and it dries very quickly.  Unfortunately, it dries too quickly!  My last batch dried up before I could finish the copying job, and I haven't had the chance to make more ink! To make more I need Rethban Iron Ore from the Redridge Mountains. Foreman Oslow in Lakeshire is my usual supplier. "
2733,The Missing Diplomat,Speak to Mikhail in the Wetlands. ,"The Defias didn't pay me well enough to die for their cause. They took the king. Yeah, the king of Stormwind, not some lowly diplomat. He was on his way to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmore--it was a big deal apparently, and a big secret. But it's not just the Defias that are involved. They're working with someone. I think they knew this was bigger than them. My part was just to get their man on board the king's ship while it was in the harbor. The guy's name was Hendel. That's all I know. I swear! "
2734,The Missing Diplomat,Give the Sealed Note to Watcher Backus in Duskwood. ,"Jorgen, you ol' sonuva. . . . So, that's how it's going to be, huh? All right, I can deal with that. I hope he finds the Twisting Nether that much sooner! Here's what's gonna happen, <name>. I'll start using my contacts here, but you're doing most of the footwork so I save some coin. Head to Darkshire in Duskwood and find Watcher Backus --he usually patrols the north road right outside of town. Just tell him you're looking into any Defias activity for me and he'll help you out with any information he can. "
2735,Good Natured Emma,Find Ol' Emma in Stormwind and see if she is in fact Emma Felstone. ,"She's a tad ornery, and quite possibly out of her gourd. . . but the records indicate that Ol' Emma does fit the framework of who Emma Felstone might be. Perhaps you've seen Ol' Emma wander the city - she talks to herself, most often in nonsensical jibber-jabber.  Still, she doesn't hurt anything or anyone, so folks pretty much leave her be. All things considered, I would say that Ol' Emma is in fact Emma Felstone.  You might try asking if her last name is indeed Felstone. "
2736,You Have Served Us Well,"Speak with Zggi, the servant of Zardeth the Blackclaw, to claim your reward. ","I hear Lord Wishock enjoyed his beverage. You have served us well, <name>.  The Warlocks of Stormwind will be able to practice our ways without disturbance, thanks to you.  For your efforts, I have prepared a special gift for you.  Speak with my servant, Zggi, and claim your reward. "
2737,In Search of The Temple,Brohann Caskbelly in Stormwind wants you to search for the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. ,"There was a time when I was young and full of vigor like you, <class>. But now I'm old and unable to explore the world like I once did. Ah, the things I saw! But there was one mystery that eluded me. For my final quest, the Explorers' League sent me in search of The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. It was rumored to be located in the Swamp of Sorrows. Because of my frail state, I traveled the skies by gryphon in search of it but never found it. Help an old dwarf out? Perhaps you will have better luck on foot. "
2738,The Missing Diplomat,Find Jorgen in Stormwind City. ,"Recently a diplomat was sent to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmoore. That diplomat never arrived. I believe the Defias are involved in this plot, but I'm not sure how. The diplomat's disappearance still eludes public attention, but it can't remain that way for long. Agents of the king are already scouring the city for clues, but I have my own contacts I would like involved. In the Valley of Heroes is an old friend of mine named Jorgen. Find him, give him this note, and follow his instructions. "
2739,The Missing Diplomat,Find Private Hendel in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"Private Hendel is to the west of here. He's currently on guard duty protecting some of Theramore's infiltrators while they rest. They've been keeping tabs on the Horde base, Brackenwall, and looking for anything else that might threaten our borders. You should have no problem finding him; just look for the tents along the road. I have another matter to attend to, but I shall catch up to you soon enough. You can always find me in the Lady Proudmoore's tower if you have any problems. "
2740,The Missing Diplomat,Find Commander Samaul in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"The beginning of every month the Kul Tiras Marines all get paid and usually leave Theramore for somewhere else. A lot of them come here to womanize, carouse, and just have a good time. One of those groups I'd consider regulars here at the tavern, and I believe this Hendel is among them. Commander Samaul in Theramore would be able to help you find him if Hendel's still stationed there. He's completely loyal to Proudmoore, but if you drop Elling's name, he should help you out. . . discreetly. "
2741,The Missing Diplomat,Delivery Jorgen's Sealed Note to Elling Trias in Stormwind City. ,"Take this here note to Elling Trias. Don't say nothin' else to him. Just be polite and wait for him to respond. And don't worry, he will. I'm gonna only impress this on ya once more, <name>: treat this matter seriously, and keep your yapper shut. Ya can find Trias at his cheese shop, Trias' Cheese, in the Trade District. Good luck. "
2742,The Missing Diplomat,Defeat Dashel Stonefist in Stormwind. ,"Yeah, you're obviously not the smartest <class> to come into Stormwind, but you're about to be one of the dumbest to never leave. Have you met me friends? "
2743,The Missing Diplomat,Bring the Defias Docket to Elling Trias in Stormwind. ,"Whoa, this looks way too complex to be something to just lead you astray. I shouldn't even be looking at this stuff. Take it to Trias--he'll be able to make sense of it. And DON'T let anyone get in your way. This is bigger than me. It might even be bigger than him, but we'll see. And do me a favor, <name>, don't tell anyone I helped you. If my superiors found out I knew about any of this and didn't share it with them they'd probably hang me. "
2744,A New Beginning,Meet with a &lt; class&gt; trainer in Stormwind. ,"A letter magically appears in the lining of your armor. It reads:

""Welcome to the city of Stormwind, capital of the Alliance! 

Meet with a <class> trainer to begin your training. They will help prepare you for your journey across Azeroth and beyond. """
2745,The Missing Diplomat,Defeat Private Hendel in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"What? ! You come here accusing me of allying with the Defias, and think I'll just stand here while you insult me? ! Something tells me you've had this coming for a long time. "
2746,The Dragon's Eye,You must search the world for a being capable of restoring the power to the Fragment of the Dragon's Eye. ,"A fragment of the shattered medallion is all that I can offer. You must find another of dragon blood willing to assist you in forging a new key. Once you secure this key, you must travel to the Wyrmbog in Dustwallow Marsh. It is there that you will find her lair, <name>. Where to find other flights willing to help? Sadly, I do not know. . . They are said to exist. Some may even work and live among us, disguised as one of the humanoid races. I wish you luck. "
2747,Jonespyre's Request,Speak with Quintis Jonespyre in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"Excuse me, friend. . . A colleague of mine would like to speak with you about the research you are doing in conjunction with the Cenarion Circle.  He is a druid by the name of Quintis Jonespyre, and he resides in Feathermoon Stronghold, Feralas.  He would like to confer with you about morrowgrain. . . and he very much would like for you to keep our discussion from the ears of the Arch Druid. If you're interested, speak with him; no doubt, all will be revealed once you do. "
2748,A Meal Served Cold,"Kill a Cold Eye Basilisk, get a Chilled Basilisk Haunch, and return it to Angus Stern in the Blue Recluse. ","One of my most famous dishes is Chilled Basilisk in Lime Vinaigrette.  But the problem is. . . the meat is impossible to keep fresh, and I must serve the dish tonight for a noble's birthday! So if you can bring me a Chilled Basilisk Haunch from a freshly-killed Cold Eye Basilisk, quickly, then I will owe you a king's feast! Cold Eye Basilisks are known to roam along the beach dunes of northwestern Stranglethorn, so you have much traveling to do.  And be swift! "
2749,A Donation of Wool,We are currently accepting donations for wool cloth. ,"Wonderful!  We thank you for your generous donation, <name>! "
2750,Stormwind Library,"King Anduin has placed great importance on learning, and thus has provided funds for making copies of various tomes and writings available to the public. ","Do any of these titles interest you, <name>? "
2751,Assisting Arch Druid Staghelm,Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus. ,"Excuse me <class>, but I'd like just a moment of your time if possible. The Cenarion Circle in Darnassus is looking for seasoned adventurers such as yourself to lend them aid in a vital research project.  While I do not know the specifics, I can inform you that none other than Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm is spearheading this research. Please - if you are interested, speak with him directly in the Cenarion Enclave within Darnassus proper. "
2752,The Missing Diplomat,Speak to Elling Trias in Stormwind. ,So yeah. . . um. . . I might know something 'bout that meeting at Addle's Stead. Happened a few weeks back I think. I really didn't have any part in it. Me part was done when plan A failed. . . damn adventurers. The guy we got on the inside for plan B came out of Menethil; guy called Slim. That's all I know regarding their backup plan. 
2753,Malin's Request,Find Skuerto at Refuge Pointe in the Arathi Highlands. ,"Greetings, <name>. You have the look of an adventurer about you, and I have a task that needs some tending to. Archmage Trelane, my original master, fled Stromgarde in the Arathi Highlands not too long ago, and he's asked me to help him in recovering some of the items he left behind. The city fell under siege, and he attempted to defend the Tower of Arathor, but to no avail. I have agents in the Highlands already, but they've requested I send more aid. Are you interested? "
2754,The Missing Diplomat,Speak to Jaina Proudmore in Dustwallow Swamp. ,"Let me be first to thank you for all you've done, <name>. You have been an incredible blessing to my people and the people of Stormwind. I am sorry I couldn't make your acquaintance under better circumstances. Understand also that I cannot overtly thank you for your efforts, but I assure you again, it is appreciated. When you visit Theramore in the future, seek me out and I shall try to keep you apprised of the situation. Thank you again, <name>. "
2755,The Lord of Blackrock,Venture to the Valley of Heroes in Stormwind City and speak with Field Marshal Stonebridge. ,Go to the Valley of Heroes and speak with Field Marshal Stonebridge. 
2756,The New Frontier,Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm at the Cenarion Enclave of Darnassus about the Cenarion Circle's call to explore the frontiers of Kalimdor. ,"Attention, heroes! The Cenarion Circle seeks able bodied individuals to assist them in exploring the vast new frontiers of Kalimdor!  A forbidden wasteland of unimaginable dangers lies far to the west of Tanaris and Gadgetzan, and the Circle needs willing and honorable proxies to act in their stead. All interested individuals should seek audience with the Cenarion Circle.  Speak with the Arch Druid in Darnassus, Fandral Staghelm, for more information! "
2757,Vital Supplies,Speak with Watchmaster Sorigal at Darkshire in Duskwood. ,"Our mages are conducting research at Nethergarde Keep in the Blasted Lands, research vital to our understanding of the Dark Portals. They require nearly constant supplies, but our supply line to Nethergarde is tenuous. You must help ensure the supplies make it to Nethergard.

His name is Mai'Zoth.  I know him from when the Darkspears dwelt in Stranglethorn - he is vicious, and his magic is strong. And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still. You must face Mai'Zoth and wrest from him the Mind's Eye.  It is a perilous task, but it is the only hope we have of saving Yenniku. "

2826,The Stone of the Tides,Find the haunted island for Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay. ,"If there is indeed a goblin mage and water elementals haunting the island, it could mean the Stone of the Tides can be mine! I want you to locate this haunted island. . . find out what's going on. Oh, and if you perhaps want to find out more about the Stone of the Tides, take this scrip to the Stormwind Library, they should be able to find you a copy of the book I first came across the legend in. Could it be that Gazban actually discovered the Stone. . . ? "
2827,Venture Company Mining,Bring 10 Singing Blue Crystals to Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay. ,"The Venture Company has a string of operations through Stranglethorn which keeps hard-working goblins, like me, from making honest gold!  Please, you must help me! The Venture Company is mining near the Crystalvein Mine to the north.  They can't get into the mine because of all the basilisks, but they're still able to dig up Singing Crystals from the surrounding hills.

2828,Akiris by the Bundle,Bring 10 Bundles of Akiris Reed to Privateer Bloads in Booty Bay. ,"You looking fer work, <name>? I might have some if you're up for a little challenge. I got a friend named Groy who makes a killing selling what the naga call akiris reed: it's some kind of valuable ocean reed. Not too sure what it's for, but he pays well for bundles of the stuff.

Not sure why some land-loving <race> <class> is offering help to the Blackwater Raiders, but I'm not going to turn you away. Our ship just docked here in Booty Bay and word has it that our rivals--those damned, dirty Bloodsail Buccaneers--have been spotted all over southern Stranglethorn. All the boys are too busy hitting the grog and looking for ladies!  What I need is a scout. Check the cove just north of Booty Bay along the Savage Coast and see what you find. "
2830,Keep An Eye Out,Dizzy One-Eye in Booty Bay wants you to retrieve his eye from the Bloodsail Buccaneers. ,"Avast!  Who goes there? Argh, I am but useless without me special enchanted eye.  Bad enough to have lost me eyes in battle in the first place!  But by some stroke o' luck we docked in Menethil and a traveling wizard enchanted a special glass eye that let me see again.

His loot's inside the foot, and that's what he owes me! We need to find the key to open the lock.  Maury was known to gamble with the Mosh'Ogg ogres, at their mound to the northeast.  And he told me, when he was still alive, that the last time he went to the mound he was chased off after winning too much.  Maybe the Ogres there have his key. But if they do, you might have to kill a load of them to find the right one. . . "
2832,"""Pretty Boy"" Duncan","Get Catelyn's dagger from ""Pretty Boy"" Duncan. ","My FATHER sent you? I'd have thought that old codger would have given up on me by now. It wasn't really his fault I ran off, he just shouldn't have expected I'd be willing to live a boring life, reading over musty books and associating with grey-haired, stiff-backed, stuffy mages! If you need my dagger, you'll have to get it back from ""Pretty Boy"" Duncan, one of the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Put something 'tween his shoulders and I'm sure he'll give it up. "
2833,The Bloodsail Buccaneers,"Fleet-Master Seahorn in Booty Bay wants you to kill Captain Stillwater, Captain Keelhaul and Fleet Master Firallon. ","Blast the nerve of Firallon!  He couldn't sail a skiff through Crystal Lake let alone lead an entire fleet against us. The Bloodsail Buccaneers will pay for their carelessness.  Now that we know their plan of attack, we can counter before they know what hit them.

Their fleet will sink soon after. . . . "
2834,Skullsplitter Tusks,Acquire 18 Skullsplitter Tusks and return them to Kebok. ,"It's expensive and hard to kill enough tigers to support the export of tiger fangs to the islands in the South Seas. Luckily, we've developed a technique that allows us to take mundane horn-like objects and turn them into undetectable forgeries. The closest match we've found, amazingly, are the tusks of the Skullsplitter trolls. Hey, before you say anything, what the buyer doesn't know doesn't hurt them, am I right? Bring me a large number of them so we can get to work on the monthly shipment! "
2835,Mok'thardin's Enchantment,Far Seer Mok'thardin of Grom'gol needs Holy Spring Water. ,"There is but one final reagent needed to complete the enchantment. In the south, towards the western coast, high above the bluffs, lies a Holy Spring.  This spring is the subject of great conflict amongst religious and mystical scholars.

2837,Ansirem's Key,Talk to Catelyn in Booty Bay. ,"The mage that is in possession of the Stone is amplifying its power through some focal point. . . an altar of some sort. You should be able to disrupt it by overpowering it. As it happens, I know just the thing: an ancient dagger, another troll relic. There's just one. . . little problem.

But we are no closer to finding him. We must know the truth, and I fear that only the Bloodscalp chief and his witchdoctor know it.  They are the enemies of the Darkspear tribe and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from their dead lips! Bring me the heads of Gan'zulah and Nezzliok the Dire and place them within this cauldron. They are deep within Zul'Kunda.  Bring their heads. . . we will then make them talk. "
2839,Dressing the Part,Yarrr. ,"Yarrr. . . if ye be keen on enjoying the company of us experienced sea dogs, you'd best belay dressing like a blaggard!  Here, put on something proper 'fore I keelhaul yer hide.

2842,Mai'Zoth,Bring the Mind's Eye to Brother Nimetz at the Rebel Camp. ,"Kurzen may be dead, but. . . that which drove him to evil still lives!  Through my studies I have discovered this: An Ogre Mage - Mai'Zoth - dwells in an Ogre Mound within the eastern mountains of Stranglethorn.  He is rumored to employ mind-controlling magic, and I am positive that he corrupted Kurzen. If Mai'Zoth is allowed to live, then his evil may influence others, and may even cause another Kurzen to surface. Kill him, and bring me his Mind's Eye, the artifact he uses to corrupt others. "
2843,Panther Mastery,Sir S. ,"Now the hard part.  A true panther hunter can show skill by dropping Shadowmaw Panthers, the deadliest in Stranglethorn.  Prove to us that you can slay 10 of these beasts. If you think they are hard to track, wait until you attempt to slay one. . . . "
2844,Raptor Mastery,Hemet Nesingwary Jr. ,Let's see how you handle this next challenge.  There is a cagey breed of raptor out there.  We call them Jungle Stalkers.

2848,Mok'thardin's Enchantment,Far Seer Mok'thardin at the Grom'gol base camp wants 8 Shadowmaw Claws and a Pristine Tigress Fang. ,"The power of the jungle's magic must be realized and then harnessed by the Horde.  My rituals have proven successful so far.  I can cast very powerful enchantments.  For you, brave <class>, I shall make a special item indeed.

I've heard that you're no friend of Booty Bay - just like us Bloodsail Buccaneers. Fleet Master Firallon is looking for hale and hearty <men/women> just like you for a special mission.

2852,The Singing Crystals,Bring 3 Pulsing Blue Shards to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp. ,"Legends tell of a jewel, hidden deep in the heart of Stranglethorn.  We call it the Mind's Eye, and it has great powers.  If you gain this Eye then, perhaps, we can use it to bring lost Yenniku back from the darkness. I will consult with the spirits of the jungle to find the Mind's Eye.  While I do this, you enter the Crystalvein Mine, southeast of here, and gather Pulsing Blue Shards from Ironjaw Basilisks.  The shards are rare, but we will need their magic to bend the Mind's Eye to our will. "
2853,Trollbane,Travel to Hammerfall in the Arathi Highlands and speak with Zengu. ,"With Thoras Trollbane dead and Stromgarde in ruins, Vol'jin has instructed that we make every effort to spirit the legendary sword Trol'kalar from the humans' hands, so that we might use it in our coming battles against the trolls of Zul'Gurub. Zengu, one of our seasoned hunters, was dispatched to Hammerfall in northeastern Arathi Highlands to oversee its procurement. "
2854,The Spy Revealed! ,Take the Muddy Note to Lieutenant Doren at the Rebel Camp. ,"Among the valuables of the strongbox is a muddy, scribbled note.  Although barely legible, it looks to be an itinerary for Private Thorsen.  It details his patrol routes, who he speaks with and how he spends his time with the rebels.  It's signed with only one letter: -M. But whoever wrote this note must have stayed very close to Thorsen.  Whoever wrote this note is the traitor within the rebel camp. "
2855,Headhunting,Bring 20 Shrunken Heads to Nimboya at the Grom'gol Base Camp. ,"We must find if Yenniku is dead. Slay the Bloodscalp Headhunters and take from them their Shrunken Heads.

Bad enough that Gelriz's muscling out the moguls who were appointed by the trade princes, now he tries to cut in on the most notorious pirate! Revilgaz won't have it, and he's told me to take care of the problem in my own way. My way? Theft. The Venture Co. geologists near Lake Nazferiti are deeply interested in those strange blue crystals they have been finding in the mines. Bring me samples of the stone from their geologists, I don't care what you have to do to get them. "
2858,Singing Blue Shards,Bring 10 Singing Crystal Shards to Crank Fizzlebub. ,"The Singing Crystals are unique to Stranglethorn, and are very valuable to certain parties.  I can move those crystals, but the cursed Venture Company makes it hard for an honest entrepreneur like myself to gather any! I'd like to hire you. The basilisks in Stranglethorn eat the crystal.  This gives them their hardened skin, and sometimes decent quality crystal can be harvested from it. You can get it from any basilisk, but the less nasty ones are along the shores south of Zul'Kunda, to the north. "
2859,Return to Corporal Kaleb,Bring Krazek's Fixed Pot to Corporal Kaleb at the Rebel Camp. ,"While you were gone I fixed the pot you brought me.  I even added an extra steam whistle, and look!  There's a new chopper at the bottom that'll cut through leg bones! Yes yes, Krazek 's Crock Pot is a 100% cook pleaser!  I'm sure its owner will be satisfied. "
2860,Colonel Kurzen,"Kill 6 Kurzen Elite, 4 Kurzen Subchiefs, and bring Kurzen's Head to Lieutenant Doren at the Rebel Camp.

2862,The Haunted Isle,Speak with Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay. ,"Baron Revilgaz has had me keep an ear out for rumors of the strange and out-of-place in Booty Bay and Stranglethorn. I don't usually put much stock in ghost stories, but I heard some sailors in the tavern talking about a haunted island off the coast. Water elementals and a raving goblin ghost, they say. If you're going to go talk to Revilgaz, could you relay that story to him? "
2863,The Defense of Grom'gol,Commander Aggro'gosh of the Grom'gol base camp wants you to kill 15 Lashtail Raptors. ,"Throm'ka, <class>! Your arrival at Grom'gol is timely, indeed.  As commander of the Warchief's base camp here in the jungle I am bound by honor to ensure the safety of all members of the Horde.  Our mission to provide a safe chain of supply to Stonard is being hampered by some of the local inhabitants. I am putting you in charge of thinning out the raptor population outside of Grom'gol.  Once you have made significant progress, report back to me for reassignment. "
2864,Bloody Bone Necklaces,Bring 25 Bloody Bone Necklaces to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp. ,"I was sent to Grom'gol  to aid Nimboya on his quest, but. . . I too have reasons for being here. The Bloodscalp tribe is enemy to our tribe.  Collecting trophies of our enemies gives us power over them.  You may aid our tribe by hunting our enemies. They dwell to the north.  Slay Bloodscalp trolls and take from them their bloody bone necklaces.  Collect many, and your reward will be great. "
2865,The Vile Reef,Bring a Tablet Shard to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp. ,"Long ago, a great shudder of the earth sunk an old troll city beneath the waters of the Savage Coast to the northwest.  We call that place the Vile Reef, for murlocs now reside in the ruins of the city, attacking any who draw close. There is an old tablet among those ruins that tells the ancient tale of Gri'lek, a hero of troll legends.  The tale is sacred to the Darkspear tribe, and although the tablet is too large to move, I want a shard of it to enshrine in our new home in Orgrimmar. "
2866,The Hidden Key,Use the Small Brass Key to open Bookie Herod's Strongbox. ,"Although no mention of Private Thorsen is found in these records, hidden within the binding of one of Herod's ledger books is a small, brass key. And after further study of his notes, a few references to a ""secure strongbox"" are contained among various papers.  The box is somewhere within the Stockpile - the cavern complex at the back of Kurzen's Compound. If this secure strongbox is found, and the small brass key can open it, then perhaps the mystery behind Thorsen's detection will be revealed. "
2867,The Monogrammed Sash,Return the Monogrammed Sash to its owner. ,"This fine sash has the letters ""HS"" embroidered along its hem. "
2868,Hunt for Yenniku,Bring 9 Bloodscalp Tusks to Nimboya at the Grom'gol Base Camp. ,"A doom, there is.  A doom on my chief's youngest son, Yenniku.  As is a custom with our people, he was given to the Gurubashi Trolls of Zul'Gurub, but after my tribe, the Darkspear tribe, left with the orc Thrall, poor Yenniku was lost to us.  I was sent from distant Orgrimmar, back to Stranglethorn, to search for my chief's son. And I believe the Bloodscalp tribe has him. If you would help me, then hunt the Bloodscalps.  You may find them to the north.  Gather their tusks and return to me. "
2869,Scaring Shaky,"Bring 5 Mistvale Giblets to ""Shaky"" Phillipe in Booty Bay. ","If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who don't pay their gambling debts!  And there are a lot of people who owe me. Think you can help me collect? First, there's ""Shaky"" Phillipe down by the docks.  He owes me plenty after last week's game and I want my due!  But to get it, we'll have to scare him. Go out of town and hunt Elder Mistvale Gorillas.  Find a nice selection of giblets, then take them to Shaky.  Don't let on that they're from an animal; let him think the worst. "
2870,Akiris by the Bundle,Bring a Bundle of Akiris Reeds to Privateer Groy in Theramore. ,"<name>, since I have you here, I got a message from Groy while you were gone. He mentioned bein' satisfied with the last shipment that arrived and has a client that wants some more of the stuff right away. I won't be headin' to Theramore for a week, but if you're willin' to make the journey, there's no reason you can't take the stuff for me. Feeling adventurous? You do know where Dustwallow Marsh is, doncha? I'd be careful though, Theramore can be dangerous if you're the wrong kind of crowd. "
2871,Tiger Mastery,Ajeck Rouack of Nesingwary's Expedition wants you to kill 10 Stranglethorn Tigers. ,"You are learning, <class>.  Let us test your skills with the mature cats now. Kill 10 Stranglethorn Tigers this time out. "
2872,Mok'thardin's Enchantment,Bring an Aged Gorilla Sinew to Far Seer Mok'thardin in Grom'gol. ,"What I need from you now will be very difficult to obtain. To hold all these feathers, claws and the pristine fang in place I require a magical tether.  Only an aged gorilla sinew will work. You will only be able to find one on an Elder Mistvale Gorilla.  They are known to forage to the east of Booty Bay. The sinew must be perfect.  It might take quite a few kills for you to find exactly what I need but it will be well worth the hunt. "
2873,Facing Negolash,Bring 10 Barbecued Buzzard Wings and 5 bottles of Junglevine Wine to Captain Smotts' Lifeboat. ,"Negolash is a hungry giant. When the giants destroyed our ship, Negolash went straight for my kitchen.  He wasn't hungry for crew like the other giants.  Negolash wanted wine. . . and my Barbecued Buzzard Wings.  They're my specialty, and I had to go all the way to the Badlands for the recipe! If you want to lure the giant, then get some wine and a heap of buzzard wings.  Put them in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast.  When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come for sure! "
2874,Up to Snuff,Deeg in Booty Bay wants you to bring him 15 shares of Snuff. ,"Ah, the sea life.  I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life. When I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff.  Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right? So you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff.  Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders. I bet a fearless <class> like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh? "
2875,The Bloodsail Buccaneers,Report the planned Bloodsail attack to Fleet Master Seahorn. ,"Shiver me timbers!  So the Bloodsail Buccaneers are planning some sort of attack on Booty Bay?

The ol' sea dog is around town somewhere. . . . "
2876,Bad Medicine,Bring 7 Jungle Remedies and 1 Venom Fern Extract to Sergeant Yohwa at the Rebel Camp. ,"To have a chance against Kurzen, we need his healing support neutralized.  He has gathered a large number of medicine men who heal his forces with jungle remedies and poison our fighters with venom fern extracts. We need those remedies and extracts for our own.  Search the Kurzen Compound - his medicine men and jungle fighters will have the remedies, and the extracts are probably stowed in some of the camp's supply boxes. "
2877,The Captain's Cutlass,Speak with Sprogger. ,"After I lost my first ship to those giants, I bought another.  Named Smotts' Revenge, I filled it with supplies and crew, and set out to find the villains.  I found them, but. . . they beat me.  They smashed Smotts' Revenge, killed my second crew and set me on another lifeboat. This time another of the giants, Negolash, stole my cutlass. Face Negolash and bring me my cutlass! Speak with Sprogger.  He was my cook on the Smotts' Revenge, and survived the last attack.  He can help you find the giant. "

I've already lost a good number of my best guards to skirmishes with them. The costs are piling up! How will I explain this to Baron Revilgaz? Decisive action. . . Think, Kebok. . . you weren't assigned to the post you have today for sitting around. . . I've got it! You. . . <name>, is it? You'll help me, won't you? There's money to be had! Here's the deal. . . you bring me the ears of fifteen Bloodscalp Trolls, and I'll compensate you well. "
2879,Some Assembly Required,Bring 5 Snapjaw Crocolisks Skins to Drizzlik in Booty Bay. ,"Well, I've got the basic shape of the boots worked out, and they're coming along fine, but the skins you brought aren't going to be quite enough for the inner layers. ""What are we going to do, Drizzlik? "" No doubt the question on your lips, and well, isn't it lucky you're talking to Drizzlik, because he's going to tell you what we're going to do! The inner layers will never really be seen, so we'll just get some of the thicker, cheaper skins from the crocs around Lake Nazferiti to fill the boots out. "
2880,The Captain's Chest,Bring Smotts' Chest to Hecklebury Smotts in Booty Bay. ,"I used to sail a ship from here all the way to Ratchet, in Kalimdor.  I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation. Until. . . Those cursed sea giants ruined me!  They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay.  And one of the giants, Gorlash, stole my Captain's Chest.  He said he wanted it for a snuffbox.  The nerve! I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here.  Find him and get back my chest!  Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude. "
2881,Bookie Herod,Find Bookie Herod's Records. ,"If Kurzen knows Thorsen's secret, then we have a spy in our midst.  We must determine how the secret was leaked! Thorsen's contact within Kurzen's camp was Bookie Herod.  Herod is Kurzen's logistics officer and knows everything about the running of Kurzen's Compound.  If you can get Herod's notes or records, maybe we can find out how Thorsen was discovered. When we were still with Kurzen, Bookie's office was on the top floor of the camp's only two-story house.  His records are probably still there. "
2882,The Captain's Cutlass,Speak with Sprogger. ,"After I lost my first ship to those giants, I bought another.

2883,The Second Rebellion,Kill 15 Kurzen Jungle Fighters. ,"We're fighting a losing battle with Colonel Kurzen.  Not only is he a brilliant tactician, he outnumbers us at least 10 to 1!  To survive, we need to use his own, covert tactics against him. Enter his camp to the east and kill his men.  Lots of them.  And get out before reinforcements can close on you. "

He was taken by the witchdoctor Zanzil the Outcast.  Now Zanzil controls him, body and soul, and only the most potent magic could set him free. A magic that you do not have, <class>. Perhaps your Darkspear allies can offer a hope of Yenniku's salvation.  But that, I doubt. "

Our mission to supply Stonard is of the highest priority.  But complications have arisen.  A local band of ogres has occupied the Mizjah Ruins to the southeast of Grom'gol.  Despite warnings, they continue to ambush our supply caravans. I am putting you in charge of dealing with these uncooperative ogres. Travel to the ruins and attempt to drive them from the area.  At the very least it will send a firm message. "

Prove to me you can kill 10 Elder Stranglethorn Tigers.  If you can do that, you will be ready for your final challenge before I declare you a master tiger hunter in Master Nesingwary's presence. Elder Stranglethorn Tigers are not only the most difficult to find, they are also the fiercest to defeat. "
2888,Panther Mastery,Sir S. ,"Now you're ready to turn it up a notch.  If you want to prove yourself worthy of socializing with the likes of these big game hunters, you'll need to prove that you can kill 10 panthers. Those big boys are tougher.

Head out into that jungle and kill 10 Stranglethorn Raptors.  We'll see just how much of a big game hunter you are. And no, I won't tell you where you can find them!  Locating the beasts is half the challenge. "

2892,Pool of Tears,Fel'zerul in Stonard wants you to gather 5 Atal'ai Artifacts. ,"The Warchief sent us to investigate strange happenings at The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. The Atal'ai trolls are a tribe of dark casters, known for practicing forbidden magic. You can imagine how astonished we were when we arrived here to discover the temple had been sunk. The green dragons now guard the site, claiming to be protectors of Azeroth. We need to discover what happened. Explore around the Pool of Tears and gather Atal'ai artifacts. From those I can begin to piece together this puzzle. "

2895,In Eranikus' Own Words,Travel to the eastern part of Winterspring and speak with Umbranse the Spiritspeaker. ,"<name>, our first step will be to devise a method to speak with Eranikus through the gem.  He lies in a precarious state between sleep and death now, twisted within a weave of nightmares.  Though the essence you have given me is badly tainted, there is a chance we can reach him. Travel far to the icy lands of eastern Winterspring and seek one of our mortal allies, Umbranse the Spiritspeaker.  He is a human medium who speaks for the dead.

2896,The Essence of Eranikus,Bring the Oathstone of Ysera's Dragonflight and the Chained Essence of Eranikus to Itharius in the Swamp of Sorrows. ,"You engage the Oathstone, and Itharius speaks directly to your mind through the stone. ""By accepting the charge placed in this Oathstone, you agree to aid my cause and the cause of Ysera's Dragonflight in redeeming the corrupted soul of Eranikus.

2900,Fresh Meat,Bring 10 Monstrous Crawler Legs to Dar in the Swamp of Sorrows. ,"There's a high demand for the succulent taste of crawler meat among my customers; especially the meat from the monstrous crawlers. If you plan on heading to the coast, then I could easily make it worth your while to bring me back some of their legs to have transported back to Orgrimmar. The coast is to the east from here, and you should have no problem finding the creatures scurrying along the beaches and under the sea. "
2901,Noboru the Cudgel,Bring Noboru's Cudgel to the leader of The Harborage in the Swamp of Sorrows. ,"Noboru has plagued the Draenei of the Harborage for months, and his cudgel is a symbol of the brutality they have suffered at the hands of the lost ones. "
2902,Threat From the Sea,Speak with Tok'Kar in the Swamp of Sorrows. ,"Before you take rest, speak to Tok'Kar again. While you were gone I believe he finished a few weapons.

","I have no love for the sea, nor any creature I've seen come from its depths. It is a powerful but blind mistress; callous and brutal. It would bring me great pleasure to slay the fish men by the hundreds if it were within my power. But I garner some pleasure from watching their deaths at the hands of any who do the Horde's will. Which brings us to you, <class>. How many can you slay? Would you test yourself against their most powerful kind? "

If you help me escape, then I'll teach it to you. "
2905,The Missing Orders,Speak to Bengor at Stonard in Swamp of Sorrows. ,"The orders? What could you possibly want with the orders? What are you implying, <name>? Of course I relayed those orders! The soldiers I sent the orders with were ambushed and brutally beaten by murlocs. Only one survived, if you can call that surviving. He can hardly speak, cannot walk, and must be fed through a tube.

2907,Lack of Surplus,Bring 8 Unprepared Sawtooth Flanks to Tok'Kar in Swamp of Sorrows. ,"I'm working on getting some supplies together for our outpost near the beach to the east-- Tok'kar does what he can, but between shifts of guard duty and cooking for his soldiers there's not much time left in the day. They do enjoy cooking up some sawtooth meat when they can, but I haven't had time to get them another shipment. Would you mind helping them out? The young sawtooths aren't as tasty as the older ones, so stay clear of those; give them a year or two to get to full size. "
2908,Little Morsels,Feed the Fel-Tainted Morsels to the Lost Ones' captured animals. ,"I'm perfecting a weapon to use against the draenei and you're going to help me! The Lost Ones are the backward cousins of the draenei, and I've been experimenting on them.  I just need you to feed some fel-tainted morsels to their captured livestock.

2910,The Atal'ai Exile,Bring the Bundle of Atal'ai Artifacts to the Atal'ai Exile in the Hinterlands. ,"While you were braving the dangers of the Pool of Tears, one of my scouts returned with a scroll written in blood on dried flesh. It seems to be a judicial sentence against a priest of the Atal'ai tribe. This priest was sentenced to a fate worse than death amongst the Atal'ai. He was exiled to live far north in the Hinterlands, with the Witherbark trolls. I will bundle these artifacts. You are to seek out the exile and discover their true use. Return to me once your journey is complete. "
2911,Neeka Bloodscar,Speak with Neeka Bloodscar. ,"The Badlands is harsh and lies close to the Alliance-held land of Loch Modan, so communication between Stonard and the Badlands outpost of Kargath is often cut.

Several of the Lost Ones have now been further corrupted - cursed with even more fel energies! <class>, can you find it in you to take pity on these poor creatures?

2914,Encroaching Wildlife,"Kill 8 Young Sawtooth Crocolisks, 10 Sorrow Spinners and 10 Swamp Jaguars then return to Watcher Biggs in the Swamp of Sorrows. ","My caravan was destined for the eastern coast, but we did not reach our goal.  Lost Ones attacked us, killing guards and dashing supplies. I alone survived their assault.  I have sworn to protect what supplies remain, but wild creatures skulk near.  Please, help me defend my camp from the beasts! "
2915,Lack of Surplus,Bring 6 Sawtooth Snapper Claws to Tok'Kar in the Swamp of Sorrows. ,"With the threat of murlocs along the coast, we're stationed out here to protect--or warn if the force is too large--of any coming threats to Stonard. It doesn't give us much time for relaxation, and we could use some more help if you're able. The sawtooth snappers' claws make for fine weapons when properly prepared.

2916,Help Watcher Biggs,Find Watcher Biggs in the Swamp of Sorrows. ,"Magtoor has informed me that there's a stranded watcher nearby.

2917,Threat From the Sea,Speak to Katar in the Swamp of Sorrows. ,"While I begin work on your weapon, why don't you talk to Katar? He mentioned needing help with patrols along the beach, and I'd rather see you keep your wits and weapons prepared instead of getting drunk with some of the other louses I share this camp with. "
2918,The Lost Caravan,"Find the Caravan Chest in the Fallow Sanctuary, obtain the Wizards' Reagents and bring to Watcher Biggs. ","I was stunned during the attack by the Lost Ones, but before my sight went black I spied one of our wagons being dragged to the Fallow Sanctuary, the lost one village to the north.

Clutched in one skeletal hand is a torn and stained sheaf of paper. You gently remove and unroll it, revealing a hand-drawn map and a few hastily scrawled notes. The map appears to be a rendering of Shadra'Alor and its three temples with 'x' marks in several places, presumably the locations of the stolen eggs. You place the map in your pack for inspection at a safer location. "
2948,Return to the Hinterlands,Speak with Gryphon Master Talonaxe. ,"Sharpbeak is held in a cage, high on a cliff at the top of Jintha'Alor in the Hinterlands.  The key to this cage is possessed by the high priestess of the Vilebranch trolls, Vile Priestess Hexx. There.  I have done my part.  I bid you fortune on your quest, <name>. "
2949,Recover the Key! ,Elder Torntusk at Jintha'alor wants you to kill Hitah'ya the Keeper to get the Shackle Key to his bindings. ,"The key to my bindings is held by Hitah'ya the Keeper. She is in the nearby cave. Be careful, <class>, for she is guarded well. Kill her and bring the key back to loosen my shackles. Only then will I be free to return home. "
2950,A Gesture of Goodwill,Ambassador Rualeth at Aerie Peak wants you to slay Witch Doctor Mai'jin and his pet spider Tcha'kaz. ,"The rugged terrain of the Hinterlands is not only home to the Wildhammer dwarves and their gryphons, but also to a number of forest troll tribes. The trolls view the Wildhammers as squatters on their ancestral lands and spare no opportunity to accost the dwarves by attacking the gryphon aeries. One way to prove ourselves in the eyes of the Wildhammer is to help staunch these attacks by killing a Witherbark leader, Witch Doctor Mai'jin, who shelters in a cave at Bogen's Ledge, to the west of Shadra'Alor. "
2951,Lard Lost His Lunch,Lard at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to find Lard's Lunch. ,Lard was at secret special spot having picnic when ugly mean Vilebranch hit Lard wit da big stick. Lard run back to Revantusk but forget Lard lunch. Lard hungry. Maybe you go back to secret special spot and get Lard lunch? Lard scared. Go nort! Island der to da nort is da secret special spot. 
2952,Rin'ji's Secret,"Oran Snakewrithe, a well known scholar on matters concerning the Witherbark trolls, may be able to decipher the tablet. ","The tablet is covered with Witherbark troll markings. Rin'ji's secret truly is a mystery. . . It's possible that you might have something quite valuable on your hands here. On the other hand, quite the opposite is also possible. A Witherbark troll in distress would probably do anything to find his way out of trouble. . . "
2953,The Final Message to the Wildhammer,Otho Moji'ko at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to travel to Aerie Peak in the western region of the Hinterlands and place the Final Message to the Wildhammer by the well in the center of town. ,"<Otho hands you a long, blood drenched spear, wrapped in several gryphon feathers. >You take this, mon. You take this to Aerie Peak, dead center of town by the well. You plant it! Drive it right into the ground! Show those dwarves that troll mean business! Come back when you do this. Hopefully you come back alive. "
2954,Skulk Rock Clean-up,"Kill 10 Green Sludges and 10 Jade Oozes, and then report back to Fraggar Thundermantle in Aerie Peak. ","We Wildhammers remember the past, more than our brothers in Ironforge.  If you want to make friends here, then you get your hands dirty for us! The Horde abandoned their positions in the Hinterlands around Skulk Rock; it's now overrun with nasty sludges and oozes.  We've got plans on that area, but first we need a clean-up crew to make a hole for us. That's where you come in, Sunshine!  Head down there and take out ten green sludges and ten jade oozes, then report back to me here.  Move out! "
2955,The Divination,Wait until Grimshade performs the ritual of divination. ,"Give me room while I perform a ritual of divination.  I will find the connection between the feather you brought me and its owner, and follow that connection to Sharpbeak himself. That is. . . I will if all goes according to plan.  If it does not, then. . . you better close your eyes. "
2956,Troll Necklace Bounty,"You've done it already, but we will continue to accept any troll tribal necklaces you find and are willing to turn in. ","Another set of necklaces means that there are fewer trolls in the Hinterlands we have to worry about!  You've done it again, <name>.  Keep up the good work! See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(2881))"
2957,Preying on the Predators,Ambassador Rualeth at Aerie Peak wants you to kill 10 Mangy Silvermane and 5 Silvermane Wolves. ,"The Wildhammer dwarves act as companions, caretakers, and trainers to the gryphons. The gryphons have no shortage of enemies, especially among the forest troll tribes. Sometimes, though, the threat comes from natural predators, such as wolves. A single animal is no match for a gryphon, but packs have taken to targeting gryphons more often because normal prey is scarce. Culling the wolves can help to reduce their impact on the gryphons and ingratiate us to the Wildhammer. "
2958,Troll Necklace Bounty,Bring 5 Troll Tribal Necklaces to Fraggar Thundermantle in Aerie Peak. ,"Get this straight, <race> - we are NOT part of the Alliance!  The Wildhammers are independent, relying on deeds and actions to prove one's worth, rather than the blather of those who use jibber-jabber to bolster their do-nothing attitudes! If you're looking for friends here, then prove your worth to us first!  The foul trolls that choke the hillsides of the Hinterlands sometimes carry tribal necklaces.  Bring five of them to me, and we'll mark it down as a step in the right direction for you. "
2959,Avenging the Fallen,Huntsman Markhor at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to kill a Razorbeak Skylord and retrieve its Skylord Plume. ,"The filth that calls itself Wildhammer trains gryphon to slay troll. Horrible, I know, but worry not, justice will soon be meted out. For now, I want you to focus on eradicating the elder gryphons of the region. They are known as Skylords. Slay one and return to me with its plume. "
2960,In Pursuit of Featherbeard,Travel to Shadra'Alor and search for traces of Featherbeard. ,"The journal's most recent entries detail Featherbeard's concern about a growing number of Witherbark troll raids on the Wildhammer gryphon aeries and a rash of egg thefts. A search of the smaller Witherbark settlements in the area appears to have yielded no information. The last entry describes Featherbeard's suspicion that a Witherbark witch doctor named Mai'jin is behind the raids. The last, hastily written sentence states the dwarf's intention to travel to Shadra'Alor in search of the eggs. "
2961,Separation Anxiety,Huntsman Markhor at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to recover his twin brother's remains. ,"Like many in our village, I too have lost a loved one to the wilds. Alas, it was my twin brother Malkhor - taken in the same raid as Torntusk's mate by the Vilebranch. Sadly, he was not fated to live and was given a swift, brutal execution; his remains fed to the oozes and wolves of the Vilebranch. It is too late to save his life but not too late to save his soul. Recover his remains, <name>. "
2962,Message to the Wildhammer,"Otho Moji'ko at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to slaughter 8 Highvale Scouts, 5 Highvale Outrunners, 5 Highvale Rangers and 2 Highvale Marksman. ","The Wildhammer be striking up deals with our enemies, forgin' new alliances. This time, they be workin' with the high elves, mon. <Otho spits. >We be needin' to send those Wildhammer dwarves a message - a message in the blood of our enemies. Slaughter every Highvale high elf that you come across, leave their bodies as a warnin'. Never mess with trolls! "
2963,Stalking the Stalkers,Huntsman Markhor at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to kill 5 Silvermane Stalkers and 5 Silvermane Howlers. ,"Many brave trolls have been lost to the harsh wilds of the Hinterlands, <race>. The Silvermane wolves are one of the biggest threats to our hunters. They lay in wait, hiding amongst the bushes and landscape, then strike out when the opportunity presents itself. This type of ferocity will not go unchecked! You must think like the Silvermane. Stalk the stalkers! Slay them all! "
2964,Cannibalistic Cousins,Mystic Yayo'jin at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to kill 6 Vilebranch Scalpers and 2 Vilebranch Soothsayers. ,"Three different tribes of trolls inhabit the Hinterlands, <name>. That is about as far as the similarities between the tribes extends: We are all trolls and we live in the Hinterlands. The Vilebranch - aptly named - are a depraved lot; feeding on other trolls and humanoids. If Zul'jin were here, he would have destroyed the whole lot of them with a flick of his wrist - alas, Zul'jin has not yet returned and we are left to our own devices. It is up to you to destroy the filth of the region! "
2965,Return to Primal Torntusk,Elder Torntusk at Jintha'alor wants you to return to Primal Torntusk at Revantusk Village with news of his rescue. ,"Return to my mate, Primal Torntusk at Revantusk Village. Tell her that I am coming home! She is sure to reward you. "

There be a turtle out there not like the others. She be the Gammerita, leader of the saltwater snapjaws - a downright dirty thievin' reptile. Mon, she stole my best lure. Snapped it right off my line! Since then, the fish just aren't biting the same. Find Gammerita and get my lure out of her stomach. "
2967,Kidnapped Elder Torntusk! ,"Primal Torntusk at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to rescue her mate, Elder Torntusk, from Jintha'alor. ","My mate was taken by Vilebranch savages in a bold midnight raid on our village. Our spies have told me that he is still alive and being held prisoner atop Jintha'alor. The Vile Priestess Hexx is said to be preparing him for a sacrifice to the faceless blood God, Hakkar. You must save him, <name>! Our village could not stand a loss this great. "
2968,Featherbeard's Endorsement,Go to Featherbeard's Hovel and visit the dwarf if he is at home. ,"When I am finally granted an audience with Falstad Wildhammer, I hope to have our strongest advocate among the Wildhammer dwarves at my side, <name>. Featherbeard is revered among his people, both for his legendary gryphon training skills and for his wisdom. If anyone can sway Falstad Wildhammer, it is he. I would go to see him myself, except that I cannot leave the confines of Aerie Peak while awaiting my audience. Visit Featherbeard at his residence to the south and ask if he will speak with me. "
2969,Marla's Last Wish,"Bring Samuel Fipps' Remains to Marla's Grave, then return to Novice Elreth. ","My friend Marla Fipps lived with her husband Samuel before the plague, but when the plague came Samuel succumbed and joined the Scourge's ranks. Marla was spared an undeath only to die at the hands of her now mindless husband.  So strong was her love, however, that her last dying wish was to be buried with her beloved Samuel. Samuel Fipps roams at a ruined camp along the road northeast of Deathknell.  Defeat him and grant Marla's wish: bury him at her grave, in the first row of our graveyard. "

2971,Return the Book,"Return Gunther's Spellbook to him, on the island of Gunther's Retreat. ","Long ago Gunther and I, along with the now Scourge Necromancer Thule Ravenclaw, were friends and students within the Kirin Tor - a society of mages in Dalaran. Gunther and I both fell to the Plague, but I thought he either remained dead, or was raised into the ranks of the Lich King.  It is good to know he is free. We must have him.  I have placed a spell on his book that, when he sees it, will show him that I too am free of the Lich King.  After knowing this, it is my hope that he will join us. "
2972,A New Plague,Apothecary Johaan in the town of Brill wants you to bring him 4 samples of venom from a Vicious Night Web Spider. ,"While you were out gathering, I uncovered some old text in one of my tomes that indicates that an ancient plague wiped out thousands of innocent victims.  Later it was discovered that the deadly agent in the plague was preserved through the venom of Night Web Spiders. Bring me some venom from a Vicious Night Web Spider to complete this experiment.  I want to see if the contagious element from the venom will work with my new concoction.  Rumor has it the spiders can be found in Eastern Tirisfal Glades. "
2973,At War With The Scarlet Crusade,Executor Zygand in the town of Brill wants you to assassinate Captain Melrache and his two bodyguards. ,"Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in northern Tirisfal, past Faol's Rest.

Slay Melrache and his two bodyguards, in the name of The Dark Lady. "
2974,Deaths in the Family,"Bring Gregor's Remains, Nissa's Remains and Thurman's Remains to Coleman Farthing in Brill. ","The Agamand family was the most prosperous family in Tirisfal Glades.  I used to work their mills. . . before the Plague. When the Scourge first came, the Agamands fortified their home and convinced those in their employ to remain and help them defend.  We were fools, but at least we were loyal fools. The Agamands, in their pride, doomed us to undeath.  And now they are minions of the Scourge! Serve the Forsaken by defeating the Agamands who fell to the Plague.  Serve me by bringing me their remains. "
2975,The Prodigal Lich Returns,Bring the Nether Gem to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity. ,Take this Nether Gem to my old comrade Bethor.  It will let us communicate. . . and I have much to tell him. 
2976,Proving Allegiance,Obtain a Candle of Beckoning. ,"You say you are not bound by the will of the Lich King, and the enchantment Bethor placed upon my book corroborates this.  But before I believe you I must have proof that you are enemy to the Scourge. There is an old, bloody altar just off the southern coast of this island.  it is used by a powerful Scourge agent, Lillith Nefara. Take a Candle of Beckoning from this crate here.  Light it on the altar and Lillith will awake.  Destroy Lillith, and I will believe you are the Lich King's foe. "
2977,The Haunted Mills,"Slay Devlin Agamand, and bring Devlin's Remains to Coleman Farthing in Brill. ","Devlin Agamand was the younger of two sons in the Agamand family, and in life the two could not be more different.  Thurman was tall and gentle while his younger brother was weak and sharp tongued. When Agamand Mills fell to the Plague, I was not surprised to hear that Devlin was quick to succumb.  His mad chattering can still be heard near the road leading to the Agamand Mills. I'm collecting the remains of the Agamands, and I want poor Devlin.  Find him, destroy him, and bring me his bones. "
2978,The Chill of Death,Bring five Duskbat Pelts and some Coarse Thread to Gretchen Dedmar in Brill. ,"It's so cold, now.  The Plague of Undeath crawls through my veins like an icy serpent.  The Mindless State will be upon me soon.  But no doomed destiny will prevent me from serving our Dark Lady.  When the call arose I sewed body bags for the fallen soldiers of Sylvanas's mighty army. Now my hands shake from the chill.  If you would bring me five Duskbat Pelts and some Coarse Thread I could sew myself a blanket.  Help me, <name>, so that I can continue to serve the cause. "
2979,The Family Crypt,Kill 8 Wailing Ancestors and 8 Rotting Ancestors. ,"The Agamand Mills area has become a foothold for the Scourge.  Their strongest point is the Agamand Family Crypt where their local military leader, a skeleton named Captain Dargol, has headquartered.  With Necromancy he has raised the ancestors of the Agamands and plans to use them against us. This cannot pass, and you must stop it.  Travel to the Agamand Family Crypt and defeat the raised Agamand ancestors. And, bring me the skull of Captain Dargol. "
2980,Scavenging Deathknell,"Search Deathknell and the vicinity for 6 pieces of Scavenged Goods, and return them to Deathguard Saltain. ","You there!  If you're looking for something to make yourself useful, then listen up! We need fresh out-of-the-ground recruits to head into Deathknell and search for any sort of useful equipment.  Most likely, they'll be in stacks of boxes.  We expect more recruits to be rising soon, and unless we want them to stumble about naked we had better get to scavenging! Well get to work, you miserable bag of bones!  I'm not going to reward those without some hustle. "
2981,A New Plague,Bring Johaan's Special Drink to the Captured Mountaineer. ,"According to the Deathguard, another one of those foolish Dwarven Mountaineers has just been captured.  The Deathguard likes to use the cellar of the Gallows End Tavern as a holding cell until prisoners can be ""properly"" dealt with. Why don't you go see how the Captured Mountaineer enjoys this special drink I made for him?  It contains a subtle hint of what The Dark Lady has planned for the rest of Azeroth. "
2982,Proof of Demise,Bring 10 Scarlet Insignia Rings to Deathguard Burgess in Brill. ,"Executor Zygand tells me you've been out killing Scarlet Crusaders. Tirisfal Glades is crawling with them. Varimathras, lieutenant to The Dark Lady, is seeing to it personally that the scum of Azeroth, the Human race, gets wiped into oblivion. Here in Tirisfal Glades we face a particularly annoying breed of humans: The Scarlet Crusade. Venture forth and wage an offensive on the Scarlet Crusade, <class>.

2983,A New Plague,Apothecary Johaan in the town of Brill wants you to collect 5 Vials of Darkhound Blood. ,"Lady Sylvanas has called upon the Royal Apothecary Society. The Dark Lady believes our knowledge coupled with the newfound magic will provide the key to Arthas's demise.  She has challenged us to concoct a new plague, a plague deadlier than any ailment on Azeroth. This new disease will bring Arthas's Scourge Army to ruin. My studies show that the blood of beasts might prove to be the key. Bring to me 5 vials of darkhound blood so I can test my theory. "
2984,Wanted: Maggot Eye,Kill Maggot Eye and return to Executor Zygand in Brill with his paw for a reward. ,"Wanted: Maggot Eye! A foul beast, even by Gnoll standards, Maggot Eye has been sentenced to death for his crimes against The Forsaken.  This despicable villain has been stealing corpses for use by the Lich King's army.  Maggot Eye was last seen pillaging the lands near Garren's Haunt to the north of Brill. The town of Brill hereby offers a reward to the capable soul who can carry out the execution.  Show Executor Zygand the villain's paw once the deed is done. Mercy is for the weak. "
2985,At War With The Scarlet Crusade,"Executor Zygand in Brill wants you to kill Captain Perrine, 3 Scarlet Zealots and 3 Scarlet Missionaries.

2988,The Scarlet Crusade,Bring Executor Arren 12 Scarlet Armbands from Scarlet Converts and Scarlet Initiates. ,"You'll be happy to know we appear to be making progress in the mine, thanks in no small part to your efforts.  We can now turn our eyes to other concerns. My scouts have reported that a detachment of the Scarlet Crusade is setting up a camp southeast of here. The Scarlet Crusade is a despicable organization that hunts us, and they will not rest until every undead--Lich King's Scourge or no--is destroyed. We must strike first! Be careful, their unholy zeal makes them dangerous adversaries. "
2989,Doom Weed,Collect 10 Doom Weed and deliver them back to Junior Apothecary Holland. ,"So you can see the predicament that I'm in, <name>. That thing is out there collecting the wrong weeds! I'll make it worth your while to gather what I need. Bring back to me enough doom weed and I'll give you a suitable reward.

2990,The Mills Overrun,"Gather 5 Notched Ribs and 3 Blackened Skulls, then return to Deathguard Dillinger in Brill. ","The Scourge are trying to form a base at the Agamand Mills.  If they do, then they can stage further attacks within Tirisfal. The orders have been given.  The Scourge in the Mills must be destroyed. Go to the Mills.

2995,Rear Guard Patrol,"Kill 8 Bleeding Horrors and 8 Wandering Spirits, then report back to Linnea at her camp. ","The defenders on The Bulwark protecting Tirisfal from the Plaguelands are on constant alert.  But sometimes Scourge will slip past them. Our success at the Bulwark depends on a one-front battle - we cannot allow an attack from the rear, nor can we allow our defenders' supply line to be cut. Assist the Bulwark.  Patrol east and slay any Scourge you find.  Spend particular effort at the Balnir Farmstead to the east.  It has become a haven for interloping Scourge. "
2996,A Rogue's Deal,Deliver the Nondescript Letter to Innkeeper Renee in Tirisfal Glades. ,"Hey, mate! Do a favor for a young man who's been fighting more than his fair share of mindless zombies and spiders?

You should check it out. . . you do and I'll pay you well. "
2997,Delivery to Silverpine Forest,Take Apothecary Johaan's findings to Apothecary Renferrel in Silverpine Forest. ,Time is a luxury that is not afforded to those of us under the employ of Lady Sylvanas.  Surely you know this by now. As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society it is my duty to share my knowledge with my colleagues so that our collective efforts might one day provide The Dark Lady with the New Plague she so badly desires.

2999,Return to the Magistrate,Return to Magistrate Sevren in Brill. ,"Now return to Magistrate Sevren with the information I gave you.  He'll want it as soon as possible, so be swift. And if you see any Scourge on your way back, take them down - we can't let them wander our lands unchallenged. "
3000,A New Plague,Apothecary Johaan of the town of Brill needs 5 Vile Fin Scales from Murlocs in Tirisfal Glades. ,"While you were collecting samples for me, my experiments led me to realize that more reagents will be required for this new disease to spread properly. Poisoning some hapless victim is child's play. Plaguing an entire world proves to be a bit more complicated. I will need 5 Vile Fin Scales from Murlocs in the vicinity.  You will find the creatures along the coast to the north or to the west. "
3001,Forsaken Duties,Speak with Deathguard Linnea. ,"I need a fresh report from our Deathguard waystation to the east. I must know if more Scourge forces have slipped past The Bulwark and into Tirisfal.

3002,Fields of Grief,Take the Laced Pumpkin to the Captured Scarlet Zealot who is being held in the cellar of the Gallow's End Tavern. ,"Harmless pumpkins, right?  Or so it would seem.  If we are to defeat Arthas's advances from the North and the Human infestation from the South we need to start realizing the full potential of our gift of undeath. With a little ingenuity a simple pumpkin becomes an agent for our Dark Lady.  This pumpkin, laced with my latest formula, will prove to be quite a treat. Yet another Scarlet Zealot has been captured and is being kept in the cellar of the Gallow's End Tavern.  Take this pumpkin to the fool. "
3003,Rattling the Rattlecages,"Kill 8 Rattlecage Skeletons, and then return to Shadow Priest Sarvis in Deathknell when you are done. ","You've shown your potential to the Forsaken under normal circumstances <name> - now let's see you under pressure.

The northern part of the village has become overrun with the Mindless Ones, and they must be destroyed. Destroy them, show them no mercy, our former brothers and sisters as they might be. The Fallen are nothing but The Lich King's slaves. "
3005,At War With The Scarlet Crusade,Executor Zygand of Brill wants you to kill 10 Scarlet Warriors. ,"The documents Executor Arren provided are just the break we needed in our battle with the wretched Scarlet Crusade.  We now know their exact locations throughout Tirisfal Glades. But the Deathguard has larger concerns.  The Lich King's army grows in number each night.  We need someone with ""initiative"" like yourself to drive the Scarlet Crusade to the grave. Prove to me you are capable of serving The Dark Lady by travelling west to the tower past the Solliden Farmstead and slay 10 Scarlet Warriors. "
3006,Night Web's Hollow,Executor Arren wants you to kill 8 Young Night Web Spiders and 5 Night Web Spiders. ,"One of our greatest struggles is obtaining the natural resources we need to survive. Gold was scarce even in the height of the Alliance's power. There is a gold mine to the northwest that has been overrun with spiders. We need gold from the mine, but we can't very well get it while the spiders are crawling around in there. I've not much manpower to commit to the task, so we'll just have to do it little by little. Get up there and see what you can do for us, <name>. "
3007,Candles of Beckoning,You grab one of the candles and place it in your pack. ,You grab one of the candles and place it in your pack.

3070,Target: Felstone Field,Go to Felstone Field in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there. ,"Of the four cauldrons here in the west, the one located at Felstone Field may be the easiest one in obtaining access to.  The Scourge have greener troops positioned here, though they should not be underestimated. Go to Felstone Field, northwest of Andorhal, and engage the cauldron lord there.  We think it has a key that will unlock access to the cauldron.  When unlocked, use this bottle to obtain a sample of the poisons inside the cauldron; we'll need it for study in developing a counter agent. "
3071,All Along the Watchtowers,"Using the Beacon Torch, mark each tower in Andorhal; you will need to stand in the doorway of the tower to successfully mark it. ","Through the use of a magical device known as a beacon torch, we can mark targets of our choosing for future actions by our troops.  To that end, we think the Scourge are using Andorhal's watchtowers as a means to control their troop movements. Your mission: breach Andorhal's defenses to plant beacons at all four watchtowers.  You'll need to be in the doorway of each tower to plant the beacon; it will then proceed to mark the tower.  There are only five charges on the beacon torch, so use them wisely! "
3072,Skeletal Fragments,"Bring 15 Skeletal Fragments to Alchemist Arbington at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands. ","The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key.  It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold.  A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function. First thing's first though, <name>.  We'll need skeletal fragments for the key's forging.  Skeletons inside Andorhal should yield what we need, but the ones outside the walls might work too. "
3073,A Matter of Time,Use the Temporal Displacer near one of Andorhal's silos and uncover Temporal Parasites. ,"Tampering of the timeline by a sinister force - most likely the Scourge - has occurred in Andorhal!  I can try to keep the passage of time here intact and mend what has been damaged, but I'll need your help to do so uninterrupted. Temporal parasites - carrion that feed on the strands of time's altered flow - now infest the silos of Andorhal.  A blue pulse of distortion is their only visual marker.  They slow my auguries; please <name>, help me by using this temporal displacer to root out these parasites. "
3074,The Scourge Cauldrons,"Speak with High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands. ","Within the lands of former Lordaeron are eight cauldrons - four here in the west, and four more ensconced in the east.  These cauldrons spew poisons into the air, propagating the plague throughout the land for the Scourge. The necromantic might of Kel'Thuzad is too strong to outright shut down these cauldrons, but we think we might have a way to subvert them to our advantage.  My second, High Priestess MacDonnell, will be your point on this assignment; she'll continue the briefing from here. "
3075,Good Luck Charm,Return to Janice Felstone in Western Plaguelands her Good Luck Half-Charm. ,"It would seem that I was wrong about you <name>, and for that I owe you an apology.  My sister sent me a number of personal effects, including humorously enough the deed to the Felstone farm.  I think I'll pass on reclaiming it right now. If my sister's spirit remains tethered to the farm and cannot rest, please. . . could you return this to her?  It is half of a good luck charm she had, with her husband having the other half. Maybe her knowing I have these things will now put her soul to rest. "

3079,The Last Barov,Travel to Chillwind Camp - Alliance territory - and assassinate Weldon Barov. ,"Naturally, with my brother still alive, there may be some contention as to the primary beneficiary of the family's fortune. This cannot be. A low down guttersnipe like you isn't above a little cold-blooded murder, I hope. It's a simple task and one that I expect you will complete; that is, if you wish to claim your reward. Weldon sits under Alliance protection at Chillwind Camp, to the east. Slay him, return his head. <Alexi yawns. >Hurry along now. "
3080,Scarlet Subterfuge,Speak to Myranda to gain the Scarlet Illusion. ,"I am what you would call, an illusionist. Though I may be able to create an illusion to allow you entry into Hearthglen, be warned; my powers have their limitations. Should you travel too far from these lands, the effects of the illusion will cease.

And now he has a tomb in his honor - how lovely. My sources tell me that the scarlet fools are keeping one of his 'holy' relics atop their guard tower near the gates of Hearthglen.

3089,Scholomance,"Speak with Alchemist Arbington at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands. ","On the island of Caer Darrow lies Scholomance - a wretched center of Scourge necromancy and evil.  Our enemy dwells within, conducting unspeakable acts of depravity on unwitting victims. . . at least, we surmise as much.  A door bars the way, and try as we might no entry is to be had without a proper key. Alchemist Arbington is well versed on Scholomance, and has an idea how to obtain a key.

Once there, place the barrel in the center of the lumber mill; find someplace suitable, like on a crate and then open it. The termites should do their work from there and make the mill useless to the Crusade. "
3092,Counting Out Time,"Locate 5 Andorhal Watches amongst the rubble of the city, and return with them to Chromie in the Andorhal Inn, Western Plaguelands. ","If you are willing to help once more, I can certainly use your assistance.  I'll gladly take more watches you might uncover from the ruins of Andorhal.

3093,Counting Out Time,"Locate 5 Andorhal Watches, found in lockboxes amongst the rubble of the city. ","I need you to reach into the world beyond this room, <name>.  Allow me to explain. You see the difference in this room compared to the rest of Andorhal.  My dragonflight works in many different ways and in many different timelines.

Find them in lockboxes found in the ruined buildings that make up this once proud city. "
3094,Glyphed Oaken Branch,"Based on the magic enchanted within the Glyphed Oaken Branch, its delivery to the Cenarion Circle in Darnassus is the next step the tauren druid sought. ","The lifeless hand of the tauren druid clutches a surprisingly healthy looking oaken branch.  Examining the branch reveals glyphs of a druidic nature carved into the bark. As you grasp the branch, you notice it is warm to the touch, more than it should be.  The image of the Teldrassil tree enters your mind - Darnassus specifically - and the words ""Cenarion Circle"" are on the tip of your tongue.  It would appear that the suggestion of where to take the branch has been placed within it. "
3095,Better Late Than Never,Check with the Royal Overseers of the Undercity to learn the whereabouts of a Jeremiah Felstone. ,"You pick up the package, wiping off a small layer of dust and grime that had settled on it.

It's not my job to question what that importance is, but regardless, I'm in no shape to continue until I rest up. If you're willing, I'd pay handsomely for some help. Start south of here at their camp near the small bulwark they've set up. If you prove strong enough, maybe I could get your help with my main goal. "
3099,Defiling Uther's Tomb,Defile Uther's Tomb and return to Mehlar Dawnblade at the Bulwark in the Western Plaguelands. ,"There, that's better.  I've added a little fel magic to it.

3100,The Last Barov,Travel to the Bulwark - Horde territory - and assassinate Alexi Barov. ,"With the deeds recovered, there is but one thing left to do. Alexi must be killed. With him dead, I need not ever worry about an unscrupulous gang of mercenaries seeking my head. It's a simple task. Alexi hides under the protection of the Horde - at the Bulwark. No, I do not expect you to just walk up and kill him, I want his head! How you get it. . . well, that part is up to you. That type of behavior is below one of my noble upbringing. "

3191,Lifting the Curse,See the updated quest page: Lifting the Curse. ,"To break the curse and free all of my brethren, the. . . thing. . . stowed on my ship must be retrieved and cleansed!  I don't know what it was, but I do know that it was stored securely in the ship's strongbox, which Captain Halyndor lorded over. My old captain is still in my dreams.  I know he walks my doomed ship, the Intrepid.  Get the key from him, and use it to open the Intrepid's strongbox. Then, after you have the cursed thing, bring it to the priest Glorin Steelbrow in town. "
3192,The Thandol Span,Destroy the cache of explosives. ,"Heavens no!  Poor Rustlocke.  'Tis quite a tragedy indeed. We must not let his death pass in vain.  This parchment you discovered indicates that Kam Deepfury, the mastermind behind the original attack, arranged for a cache of explosives to be stashed just across the Thandol Span, in Arathi Highlands. If those explosives make it to the bridge, our major supply line to the north will be severed!  The cache must be destroyed, <name>!  Return to me when your mission is complete. You're our only hope. "
3193,Ormer's Revenge,Ormer Ironbraid wants you to kill 10 Mottled Scytheclaw raptors and 10 Mottled Razormaw raptors then return to him at the Whelgar Excavation Site. ,Now it's time to really make those dreaded Raptors regret their blood-thirst.  Just down below there are scores of Mottled Scytheclaws and Mottled Razormaws.  Make those rotten creatures pay by slaying 10 of each! 
3194,Claws from the Deep,Kill 12 Bluegill Murlocs. ,"Murlocs are crawling out from the deep waters and building their villages on the coastline.  They are harassing our fishers and merchants and must be stopped. One of these murlocs, Gobbler, skulks with other bluegill murlocs and harries merchants along the road, always then retreating to the safety of the nearby murloc hovels.  Our merchants are in jeopardy, and we will pay to secure them. Gobbler prowls the river inlet north of here.  Find him, slay his kin, and bring me his head. "
3195,Blisters on The Land,"Kill 8 Fen Creepers, then return to Rethiel the Greenwarden in the Wetlands. ","I do not know why, but a festering grows within the Wetlands. Fen Creepers have risen.  They are diseased, fevered blisters on the land, and for the fever to break they must be dispatched and allowed to settle back into the marshes. The Fen Creepers shamble amidst the waterways of the Wetlands. "
3196,Reclaiming Goods,Search the crates and barrels at the coastal Murloc camps. ,"Not long ago a merchant vessel, the Blind Princess, was raided by Murlocs.  Although the ship escaped intact, much of its cargo was dragged overboard by the creatures, including a very valuable statuette of Terenas Menethil.  We want that statuette recovered. Search the coastal Murloc hovels for crates, barrels and other evidence of lost cargo.  Find the Menethil Statuette and return it to me. "
3197,Report to Mountaineer Rockgar,Speak with Mountaineer Rockgar. ,"Mountaineer Rockgar is looking for volunteers for a mission through Dun Algaz and into the Wetlands. If you want to get your boots wet in that soggy county to the north, then speak with Rockgar at Dun Algaz.  Dun Algaz is north up the road, beyond the guard tower. "
3198,War Banners,Bring 8 Dragonmaw War Banners to Captain Stoutfist. ,"The Dragonmaw orc clan was all but destroyed by the end of the Second War, after they lost control of their red dragon pets.  The dragons were not very happy with their old masters, and fiercely hunted the Dragonmaws.  What few remained fled from Grim Batol and into the Mountains east of Whelgar's Excavation. Now they've gained strength, and have an encampment northeast of Menethil. We want you to attack that encampment.  Gather and bring me their war banners as proof. "
3199,The Cursed Crew,"Kill 13 Cursed Sailors, 5 Cursed Marines and First Mate Snellig. ","<Bolstered, Fitzsimmons continues his tale. . . >I am the sole survivor of the ill-fated Third Fleet of Kul Tiras, wrecked off the coast to the north.  But although I'm the only member of the fleet still breathing, I'm not the only one still walking about!  For on one of our ships was hidden a great, and terrible treasure, and the eerie power of it keeps the souls of my brothers trapped within the ships' rotting hulls. But if you can free some of my brothers, then perhaps you can break their curse. "
3200,Apprentice's Duties,Collect 6 Giant Crocolisk Skins and bring them to James Halloran in Menethil Harbor. ,"I sent my apprentice out into the marshes to skin some of our famous giant Wetlands crocolisks. When he didn't return, I went out to look for him. . . Let's just say it wasn't a pretty sight. Midwife says he might pull through, but in the meantime I still need my skins! . . . If you'd like to kill a few more of the brutes, I wouldn't be opposed, after what they did. You'll find the crocs north up the coast, beyond the murloc hovels. "
3201,The Third Fleet,Buy First Mate Fitzsimmons a Flagon of Mead. ,"I was once First Mate on the Wave Mistress, ship-of-the-line in the Kul Tiras Third Fleet.  The Doomed Fleet.  Doomed, for on its last voyage the fleet was attacked  by Red Dragons.  Dragons controlled by Orcs! We didn't stand a chance against that dragonfire. . . and our fleet was burned and sunk off this here coast.  I'm the sole survivor of those poor vessels. . . . . . Oh, my head hammers and pounds!  I'll need a fresh drink if I'm to get a handle on this hangover and continue my tale. "
3202,Cleansing the Eye,Bring Archbishop Benedictus the Cursed Eye of Paleth. ,"I can't lift the curse from the Eye of Paleth.  The Eyes were crafted by Human Priests, so you'll have to go to Stormwind to find someone who can help you.  Speak with Archbishop Benedictus.  He is head of the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind.  He can help. I hope, for your sake. "
3203,Report to Captain Stoutfist,Speak with Captain Stoutfist. ,"<name>.  The Dragonmaw orc clan is showing its strength in more than just Algaz. Captain Stoutfist has asked to speak with those willing to offer aid against these orcs.  He is inside the keep, in the war room. "
3204,The Algaz Gauntlet,Traverse Dun Algaz. ,"Orcs of the Dragonmaw clan have a haven in the Wetlands.  And now they have expanded into Dun Algaz!  We can't let them keep their foothold here or Loch Modan will be cut off from Menethil Harbor, our port and stronghold in the Wetlands. Break through Dun Algaz to the Wetlands beyond, and kill some orcs for good measure!  Report to Valstag Ironjaw in Menethil Harbor. Menethil is through Dun Algaz, then north along the road, then west at the fork. We're counting on you, <name>.  Do not fail. "
3205,The Eye of Paleth,Bring the Cursed Eye of Paleth to Glorin Steelbrow at Menethil Harbor in Wetlands. ,"Opening the chest reveals a blackened orb, pulsing with an eerie light.  It is the treasure of which Fitzsimmons spoke: a Cursed Eye of Paleth. Take the Cursed Eye of Paleth to the dwarven priest Glorin Steelbrow, in Menethil Harbor.  Ask him how to remove the Eye's curse. "
3206,A Grim Task,Kill Balgaras the Foul and bring his ear to Longbraid the Grim outside of Dun Modr. ,"Many of my soldiers died in the battle of Dun Modr. My own brother perished when the West Bridge over the Thandol Span was destroyed.  Aye, the Dark Iron dwarves are a devilish breed.  From what Roggo was able to gather, the leader of the thugs in the Wetlands is a warlock named Balgaras the Foul. He is quite a coward, sending his soldiers to do his bidding but hides in his camp on Direforge Hill, to the southeast. If you can find the spineless scum, slay him and bring me his ear. I will reward you, <class>. "
3207,The Thandol Span,Rhag Garmason wants you to locate Ol' Rustlocke. ,"A tremendous explosion roared through the hills.  'Twas horrible, I tell you! Good soldiers died defending the Thandol Span.  Longbraid says we'll take revenge on the Dark Irons before all is said and done. We're in a world of hurt though and I don't see any reinforcements in sight.  Longbraid sent Ol' Rustlocke to scout the eastern bridge to see if we could secure it. That was days ago.  We haven't the manpower to search for him with Dun Modr under siege. Perhaps you can find him. . . "
3208,Digging Through the Ooze,"One of the oozes at Ironbeard's Tomb has Sida's bag, retrieve it and bring it back to her in Menethil Harbor. ","On my weekly visit to Ironbeard's Tomb I was attacked by dreadful, dripping oozes! Naturally, I panicked. I threw my bag at one, but it didn't do anything! The ooze just sucked it right up. . . Luckily, it did give me enough time to get away. The bad news is that I really need to get the contents of my bag! I don't know which ooze I threw my bag at; they all looked the same! Ironbeard's Tomb is northeast of here, near Dun Modr. Thank you so much! "
3209,The Greenwarden,Find the Greenwarden. ,"You've heard of the Greenwarden?  You're not looking for him, are you?  Well I say you're crazy if you are, but who am I to keep a fool from <his/her> death? If you are seeking that beast, then I hear he is in the marsh, east of the road where it forks to Dun Modr.  He's lurking there among the crocs. . . and worse! And leave your money here.  You won't need it where you're going. . . and you don't want to chip ol' Greenie's tooth on your gold when he bites you in half, do you? "
3210,Daily Delivery,"Deliver the Bundle of Crocolisk Skins to James Halloran, the tanner, in Menethil Harbor. ","Greetings, traveler! Don't suppose you might be heading in the direction of Menethil, would you? If you're not, I'd suggest you stop there, it's a good place to purchase goods and even have a pint and relax. Now, if it just so happens that you're heading in that direction, I don't suppose you'd mind taking this bundle of crocolisk skins to James Halloran, the tanner? I'd do it myself, but my wife's been in quite a mood lately, and I'd like to put off facing her as long as possible. "
3211,Nek'rosh's Gambit,Destroy the Dragonmaw catapults. ,"While you were fighting the Dragonmaws, we discovered more of their plans. Nek'rosh has built catapults and aims to lay siege to Menethil!  And with the fighting in Dun Algaz, we're effectively blocked from reinforcements! You need to take out those catapults.  They're in the Dragonmaw encampment. Here, take this tinder.  Fight your way to the catapults and light them with the tinder. And after you've done that, find and kill Nek'rosh.  We need to cut this Dragonmaw beast down. . . at its neck. "
3212,In Search of The Excavation Team,Tarrel Rockweaver wants you to travel to the Excavation Site and contact Merrin Rockweaver. ,"Oh my, you must be the scout Longbraid said he would send!  You cannot imagine how worried I have been. My wife, Merrin, has been sending me letters each week for the past month.  She is part of the Whelgar Excavation team.  But it has been nearly two weeks since her last correspondence.  Surely something is wrong! Longbraid said that he would send a scout to check up on things if we did not hear from the team soon.  I assume that scout is you, <name>.  Find Merrin at the excavation site to the east! "
3213,The Thandol Span,Report back to Rhag Garmason at Dun Modir in Wetlands and show him the parchment you found on Rustlocke's corpse. ,It seems as though poor Ol' Rustlocke ran into a Dark Iron ambush.  You notice a parchment next to his clenched fist. Report the grim news to Rhag Garmason and show him what you found. 
3214,Young Crocolisk Skins,Obtain 4 Young Crocolisk Skins for James Halloran in Menethil Harbor. ,"I'm James Halloran, the tanner. My cured crocolisk skins are sought after all over, shipments leaving by boat to ports around the world. Met Einar? He's one of the hunters that brings crocolisk skins in for me. I'm a bit short on the softer skins that come off crocolisk young. Being that I'm running low, I'll pay you top coin for a stack of the skins. You can find the young crocs in the marshes right outside of town. "
3215,Tramping Paws,"Kill 15 Mosshide Gnolls and 10 Mosshide Mongrels, then return to Rethiel the Greenwarden in the Wetlands. ","The Mosshide Gnolls have lived in the Wetlands peacefully for many years, but now grow in numbers.  Their feet stamp flat the fen's bushes and flowers, and their foul axes cut too much wood to fuel their fires. They are no longer in balance with the land.  For the Wetlands to survive, the Gnolls must be reduced. Kill 15 Mosshide Gnolls and 10 Mosshide Mongrels.  Hunt them to the south, near the Dwarven gate of Algaz.  After you do this, return to me. "
3216,Fire Taboo,Bring Rethiel the Greenwarden 9 Crude Flints. ,"The Mosshides are cutting the trees of the Wetlands, using the trees' flesh to warm themselves with fire.  I will suffer this pain no longer! Rid the Mosshides of their crude flints, the tools they use to make fire.  The flints are borne by all Mosshides except the smaller Mosshide gnolls and Mosshide mongrels. "
3217,The Search Continues,Search for the Menethil Statuette. ,"You thoroughly search this cluster of Murloc hovels, and find no trace of the Menethil Statuette. Perhaps one of the two nearby hovels to the north and northeast will have more clues. "
3218,Plea To The Alliance,Seek out Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe in Arathi Highlands. ,"I ask of you one more small favor, <class>.  We await the reserves of Ironforge.  However, Roggo has knowledge of an Alliance camp to the north in Arathi Highlands at Refuge Pointe. Travel there and seek out Captain Nials.  Ask the good Captain if the Alliance can spare some soldiers to help us reclaim Dun Modr and the Thandol Span. "
3219,Search More Hovels,Continue searching the Murloc hovels for the Menethil Statuette. ,"This grouping of Murloc hovels, after a thorough inspection, reveals nothing. . . . but you're certain that the next clue you find will be fruitful. One of the hovels to the north must have the Menethil Statuette! "
3220,<UNUSED>,Kill Maruk WyrmscaleReport to Valstag Ironjaw in Menethil Harbor. ,"Other than you, we sent two scouts through Algaz.  Only one returned.  Here's what he discovered: The Dragonmaws sent one of their Lieutenants, Maruk Wyrmscale, to organize a crew of orcs in Algaz and cut off the land route to Menethil Harbor! We have to stop this, now.  Take out Maruk, and then report to Valstag Ironjaw in Menethil Harbor. Maruk is headquartered in a small cave, across a pond between the second and third tunnels of Algaz.  Menethil is through Algaz, then west along the road.

3221,In Search of The Excavation Team,Return to Tarrel Rockweaver at Menethil Harbor in Wetlands with Merrin's note. ,"It was horrible!  We were uncovering some rare artifacts and we began to discover these large bones. Before we knew what was happening, these Mottled Raptors overwhelmed the dig site.  Many lives were lost. Ormer here -- so brave -- saved the Prospector and me.  He defended us as we ran for shelter.  Now we are trapped.  And our hard work lies in ruin. Here, take this note back to my sweet Tarrel.  It will explain the situation to him. "

3223,Warsong Supplies,"Collect the Warsong Supplies: Warsong Saw Blades, Logging Rope, Warsong Oil, and the Warsong Axe Shipment for Locke Okarr in Splintertree Post. ","We are in short supply of a few items at the Warsong lumber camp! Pixel at Splintertree Post has our shipment of saw blades. It'll take a trip to Booty Bay to pick up a crate of axes from Wharfmaster Lozgil. Our shipment of oil and rope will be more difficult. The rope was pilfered by the Thistlefur and Foulweald furbolgs, and the satyrs intercepted the delivery of the oil and are now using it for detestable rituals in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian! Can you help me? "
3224,The Lost Pages,"Find the 12 missing pages of the Shredder Operating Manual, and put them together to form Chapters 1, 2, and 3. ","I just picked up this shredder from Ratchet and I was on my way back to the Warsong Lumber Camp, where I am supposed to be on duty. I was given a manual on how to operate the shredder, but on the trip back, a huge gust of wind blew it from my hands. The pages went everywhere, and all I was left with was the cover. The pages could be just about anywhere by now, I suppose. . . but I don't know how to use the shredder without them! Will you find them for me? "
3225,The Warsong Reports,Open the Bundle of Reports. ,"I recently deployed a few scouts into Ashenvale and I need a runner to take them their orders, and bring me back a report of what they have observed. Your first stop should be the Zoram'gar Outpost, along the coast to the west, at the Zoram Strand, to locate the first runner. You also need to stop at Splintertree Post, to the north, and along the road to the east, near Azshara. You will find a scout and an outrider there. Give them each a report, and from them, get an update on their findings. "
3226,Naga at the Zoram Strand,Bring 20 Wrathtail Heads to Marukai along the Zoram Strand. ,"There is evil lurking here along the coast, <race>. It is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, long destroyed and submerged beneath the seas.  Lost, and nearly forgotten. Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know.  But reason matters little; we must defend the land we have worked so hard to claim as our own. Return to me with 20 of their heads! Throw the naga back to the depths! "
3227,Warsong Saw Blades,"Direct from Ratchet, the Warsong saw blades! Yep, I have them right here. ","This is perfect -- just the thing! Well, here's the shipment. "
3228,Fallen Sky Lake,"Retrieve a Fallen Moonstone from the Shadethicket Oracle, then bring it to Pelturas in Astranaar. ","Relara's fever has passed, but she is still very weak.  I do not believe time alone will give her back the strength she has lost.  I believe it will take the power of a moonstone. We used to gather moonstones at Fallen Sky Lake to the southeast. . . until the Shadethickets came. Their leader, a Shadethicket Oracle, gathered up all the fallen moonstones and hoards them.  Now, you must retrieve a moonstone from the Oracle. And to do that, I fear that you must slay him. "
3229,Baron Aquanis,"Bring the Strange Water Globe to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale. ","The defeated water elemental has left behind a strange water globe.  You surmise that the object somehow fed the beast energy.  Inside the globe, a putrid-looking form of water sloshes about.  The globe itself seems impervious to any sort of physical force. If anyone can make any sense of this item, it would be Je'neu Sancrea of the Earthen Ring.  He is located at the Horde's Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale. "
3230,The Zoram Strand,Bring 20 Wrathtail Heads to Shindrell Swiftfire in Astranaar. ,"There is evil lurking on our northwestern coast, known as the Zoram Strand. It is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, destroyed during the Sundering and submerged beneath the seas.  It has been lost to the night elves for ages.  Lost, and nearly forgotten. Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know.  But reason matters little; we must slay these fiends and throw them back to the depths! Return to me when your mission is complete. "
3231,Between a Rock and a Thistlefur,Take down 8 Thistlefur Avengers and 8 Thistlefur Shaman; most are located east of Zoram Strand in Thistlefur Village. ,"The Thistlefur furbolgs are threatening our expansion!  Thistlefur Village to our east blocks the way between us here and the Splintertree Post.  It's a path that would circumvent the village of Astranaar; without it, we give the Alliance an extra expansion path. <name>, we must not allow. . . an expansion path gap! Proceed to Thistlefur Village and thin out the furbolgs.  You will be given compensation for this task, but more importantly you will be doing your duty for the Horde! "
3232,Never Again! ,"Kill Gorgannon and Diathorus the Seeker, and then return to Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song in Ashenvale. ","<name>, it falls to you to see that this attack by the Burning Legion never comes to pass.  You must go and slay their leaders.  Without them the rest of the demons are essentially mindless. You will find Gorgannon in Demon Fall Canyon south beyond Felfire Hill, near Mannoroth's floating, broken spear. Diathorus the Seeker resides somewhere in the barrow den atop Demon Fall Ridge.  To find the ridge, look for a ramp up from Demon Fall Canyon near the Horde's monument to Grom Hellscream. "
3233,Answered Questions,Return to Thyn'tel Bladeweaver in Darnassus. ,"We shall rein in the worgen problem, have no worry of that. This evil that your friend introduced to our woods will be contained, and I bear her no ill will for her actions. Strange events are afoot in these times, <name>, and the darkness knows no respite. I will keep you no longer. I suspect that there are others that should hear of what you have found in the mines of Duskwood. "
3234,The Howling Vale,"Go to the Howling Vale and study the Tome of Mel'Thandris, then return to Sentinel Melyria Frostshadow at Forest Song. ","Though we have put many resources and much effort into driving the remaining demons from the Felwood to the north, our successes have been few. We have been able to keep much of the demonic presence from Ashenvale. To the north, near the Felwood border, the ruined shrine of Mel'Thandris has been overtaken by mysterious wolf-men. Their chilling calls have led the area to be known as the Howling Vale. The Tome of Mel'Thandris kept at the shrine may shed some light on why these wolf-men have come. "
3235,Raene's Cleansing,Find the hidden shrine and re-enchant Dartol's Rod. ,"Here is the completed rod, <name>. Reconstructing it was simple. . . it's finding the shrine that has the power to recharge it that will be the hard part. With some focus and effort it shouldn't be too hard for someone like you, who's already accomplished so much. Head southeast of here--there are very few paths, so be careful--and keep your eyes to the north. The shrine is hidden within the mountains that surround this glade. Once there, place the rod within the shrine. . . the rest is magic. Hehe. "
3236,The Befouled Element,"Bring the Befouled Water Globe to Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale. ","The slain elemental has produced an intensely glowing globe of water.  The contents of the globe are, at best, disgusting.  It would be safe to assume that whatever has befouled the water of Mystral Lake is most likely present in the water of the globe. It's not exactly common knowledge who might be interested in such a find; perhaps the person who originally sent you out to the lake, Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, might have an idea. "
3237,Never Again! ,Kill Gorgannon and Diathorus the Seeker. ,"<name>, you will see to it that this attack by the Burning Legion never comes to pass!  Go and slay these dreadlords!  Without them the rest of the demons are essentially mindless. You will find Gorgannon in Demon Fall Canyon south beyond Felfire Hill, near Mannoroth's floating, broken spear. Diathorus the Seeker resides somewhere in the barrow den atop Demon Fall Ridge.  To find the ridge, look for a ramp up from Demon Fall Canyon near the monument to Grom Hellscream. "
3238,Raene's Cleansing,Find the final piece of Dartol's Rod and return to Shael'dryn at the moonwell. ,"The final piece of the rod was given to the druids of Dor'danil for safekeeping. I have no idea where they hid it. I'm sorry I can't help you more than that. All I can tell you is to follow the road that leads towards the Barrens. The druids took shelter to the east of that road, but they won't be of much help to you: they were killed recently. . . it's something I don't like to think about much. When you find the final piece, bring it to me and I will help you reconstruct the rod. "
3239,Je'neu of the Earthen Ring,"Bring the Befouled Water Globe to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale. ","The Earthen Ring is a shamanistic group dedicated to studying and preserving the elements.  They have forgotten more about crazy old gods, ancient legends and lore than most scholars will ever know. Lucky for you, I know someone in the Earthen Ring here in Ashenvale.  Head over to Zoram'gar Outpost on the coast of the Zoram Strand; show Je'neu Sancrea what you found.  If anyone can figure out that globe's significance, it'd be him. "
3240,Culling the Threat,Bring Dal Bloodclaw's Skull to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar. ,"Directly to the north of Astranaar are the Thistlefur furbolg. My scouts report that their numbers have grown greatly over the past few months. If they grow too great, they may find the courage to attack Astranaar directly. Kill as many of their kind as you can, but bring me their chieftain's skull as proof that their efforts have been stifled. . . for now. I shall remain here in Astranaar and await word from you. Elune be with you. "
3241,Stonetalon Standstill,"Dispatch 12 Befouled Water Elementals at Mystral Lake, due east of the Talondeep Path and southwest of Splintertree Post. ","If you want to be useful, then why don't you do something about the situation near Talondeep Path? The transports between Ashenvale and Stonetalon are at a standstill because of the lake coming alive and attacking anything that gets close. . . which means anyone on the path.  What'd be even more useful than just putting the hammer down on the water elementals there is someone scouting the gazebo on Mystral Lake - the one that has a solid view of the Alliance outpost there. You up for being useful? "
3242,Onward to Ashenvale,Speak with Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar. ,Recently Raene Wolfrunner came through Auberdine from Darnassus and was heading to Ashenvale; she said something about the Furbolgs. I wasn't given an opportunity to ask more about her situation but perhaps you can seek her out and lend her your aid <class>. Take the southern road out of Auberdine. Once you reach Ashenvale border continue your path down the road. There you will find Astranaar and Raene Wolfrunner. 
3243,Mage Summoner,Slay Sarilus Foulborne and bring his head to Sentinel Velene Starstrike in Silverwind Refuge. ,"There's only one undead mage in the Barrens capable of defiling this many water elementals. He's also the only one foolish enough to try. Sarilus Foulborne is probably sitting at the top of Dreadmist Peak, laughing at me. <name>, you must go into enemy territory and destroy this miscreant. I have had enough of his idiocy and we must show him what happens to those who annoy the Sentinels. Destroy him and bring me his head. Be wary though, the Horde may be watching for you. "
3244,Ruuzel,Bring the Ring of Zoram to Talen near the Zoram Strand. ,"I fear the ancient statuette's secrets will remain forever hidden unless you find the key to its ancient lock. That key is a ring, the Ring of Zoram.  It belonged to the rulers of this city before the waves of the Sundering drowned it. For years the ring was lost, but the naga have recently found it. Their leader, Ruuzel, dwells on an isle on the northern edge of Zoram.  Please, <name>, retrieve the ring for me! "
3245,Raene's Cleansing,Find Shael'dryn at the moonwell to the northeast. ,"You'll have to do the research yourself, but from what notes Teronis has made, it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of the rod Dartol created. I would start by heading to the moonwell east of Iris Lake. When you're ready, follow the road and turn north when you reach a small sitting area on your left. A dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out. Keep the gem with you-- Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod. "
3246,King of the Foulweald,Place Karang's Banner on the Foulweald Totem Mound. ,"<name>, another tribe of Furbolgs,  the Foulweald, live southeast of Astranaar.  They are not as many as the Thistlefur, but their ferocity poses a future threat.  With a show of force, we can remove that threat. Take this banner, go to the Foulweald village and place it on their totem mound.  They will try to destroy the banner, but hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe.  Bring me the totem he carries. Gather your allies, <name>.  This is no task for a single <class>. "
3247,Raene's Cleansing,Bring Ran Bloodtooth's Skull to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar. ,"Return to your own tribe and let them know of your victory here. Show them your trophy, and bask in the glory. . . "
3248,Insane Druids,"Kill the druids: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, Mavoris Cloudsbreak; then return to Kayneth Stillwind in Forest Song. ","When I struggled with the Forsaken's poisons, I had a vision.  I had a vision of the druids in the Dor'danil Barrow Den, poisoned. . . murdered by the undead!  They are now errant ghosts, severed from their bodies and driven mad. So that the druids' spirits might some day find peace, you must enter the Dor'danil Barrow Den and destroy its once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall and Mavoris Cloudsbreak. Do this, then return to me. "
3249,Vorsha the Lasher,Keep Muglash safe as he travels to the brazier. ,"Vorsha the Lasher. . . the fiendish hydra that roams the seas. . . She has attacked our outpost, each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path. But I am ready, <name>. I have prepared to best the hydra and end these attacks on Zoram'gar. The naga honor the wicked nature of this beast with a brazier that remains lit on an island just off the coast. I believe that if we put it out, Vorsha will appear in anger. We will need help, so be sure to bring some strong allies. "
3250,Baron Aquanis,"Bring the Strange Water Globe to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale. ","The defeated water elemental has left behind a strange water globe.  You surmise that the object somehow fed the beast energy.  Inside the globe, a putrid-looking form of water sloshes about.  The globe itself seems impervious to any sort of physical force. If anyone can make any sense of this item, it would be Je'neu Sancrea of the Earthen Ring.  He is located at the Horde's Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale. "
3251,Destroy the Legion,"Slay 6 Mannoroc Lashers, 6 Felguards and 6 Searing Infernals, and then return to Valusha at Splintertree Post in Ashenvale. ","The remains of the demonic Burning Legion have been making raids against our Warsong Lumber Camp! No more! The demons are attacking from the areas known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge to the east. Go and destroy as many as you can to bring glory to both yourself and the Horde! "
3252,Report to Splintertree Post,Travel to Splintertree Post in Ashenvale and speak with Advisor Sunsworn. ,"<The ambassador keeps her voice low as she leans in close. >Your reputation precedes you, <name>.  I want you to travel to Splintertree Post in Ashenvale.  The easiest way to get there on foot is to travel west through Durotar and the Barrens, and then turn north at the fork in the road. When you arrive, speak with Advisor Sunsworn.  Travel carefully; Ashenvale can be a very dangerous place! "
3253,The Lost Chalice,Bring the Chalice of Elune to Kayneth Stillwind at Forest Song. ,"The area to our west, now called Satyrnaar, was once a prominent shrine built by my people. It housed a priceless relic, the Chalice of Elune, entrusted to the shrine's keepers by the priests of Elune. Pilgrims once traveled to the shrine to experience the healing powers the chalice was rumored to hold. These stories might be nothing but old wives' tales, but if there is any truth to them, the relic may hold the key to rejuvenating the wounded forest. I must know, <name>. "
3254,The Barrens Port,Speak with Wharfmaster Dizzywig at Ratchet in the Barrens. ,"Ratchet is the only port in the Barrens. Most likely Velinde found a trading vessel in Ratchet to take her to Blackwater Cove in Azeroth. We've had limited dealings with the goblins that run the port, but the master of the dock should have information about the comings and goings of ship passengers. Follow the road southeast through Ashenvale and you will find yourself in the Barrens. Watch your step, <name>, warriors of the Horde patrol the land. You will be safe at the port, though. "
3255,Shadumbra's Head,"Bring Shadumbra's Head to Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale. ",The once swift Shadumbra now lies still as you claim victory over it.  The head of the slain nightsaber is a fitting trophy for this fight of the Ashenvale Hunt. Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post will want to see such a trophy to award you credit for this part of the Ashenvale Hunt. 
3256,Pridewings of Stonetalon,Bring 12 Pridewing Venom Sacs to Shindrell Swiftfire in Astranaar. ,"We are not in open war with the Horde, but our peace is fragile.  We often find their agents moving against us, but they do so covertly. One such advance was revealed to us from hidden sources in Theramore, claiming that the orcs collect venom from the pridewings near Mirkfallon Lake, in the Stonetalon Mountains to the south.  Orc assassins then use the venom on their secret death raids against the Alliance! If this is true, then we must stop them, <name>.  We must deny them their source of venom. "
3257,Orendil's Cure,Bring Orendil's Cure to Pelturas Whitemoon in Astranaar. ,"<name>, I have created a cure that I believe will help the afflicted child.  Take it to Astranaar and give it to the child's parent, Pelturas Whitemoon. To reach Astranaar, follow the road south, then east. "
3258,Elemental Bracers,Collect 5 Intact Elemental Bracers and use the Divining Scroll on them. ,"Take this divining scroll --it can determine the creator of these elementals. But you will need something from them to use as a reagent to focus scroll's magic--their bracers should do nicely. A few intact bracers from the creatures should be enough. The other bracers will be useless for our purposes, but they may be worth something to a merchant if you wish to sell them. Once you have the intact bracers attempt to use the scroll. Return to me with the results and we shall proceed from there. "
3259,Raene's Cleansing,Find Teronis in Ashenvale. ,"<name>, a longtime friend of mine is also aiding the Sentinels here in Ashenvale, but he has yet to return. He had leads on finding an item that he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard. Before he left here, he mentioned seeking out a gem for the rod. He mentioned the gem possibly being hidden at the shrine in Lake Falathim at the base of the mountain to the west. The gem was being held there before it was overrun. Find my friend, <name>, please. "
3260,Trek to Ashenvale,Find Raene Wolfrunner in Ashenvale. ,"<name>, my mistress, Raene Wolfrunner, awaits you in the city of Astranaar within Ashenvale. With your help, perhaps we can at least ease some of the corruption that's taken hold there. Head south from here and stay close to the road--you'll find your way there without issue if you follow those directions. "
3261,The Scythe of Elune,Look for signs of the Scythe of Elune then return to Jonathan Carevin in Darkshire. ,"Your story rings true. . . I do not entirely understand your motives, but if your business here in Duskwood involves ridding the forest of worgen in any number, then I can forgo understanding for results. There is a mine to the south that has been overrun with worgen. . . They appeared out of nowhere, but from what we know, that is where they first were found. Go about your business, but I would ask that if you find anything of import, you share it with me. We will accept any aid in our war against evil. "
3262,Raene's Cleansing,Find the Wooden Key and a piece of Dartol's Rod before returning to Shael'dryn at the moonwell. ,"I wish your tidings were better. Raene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted. If your goal is to find the next piece of the rod, then you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in. The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here, near Felwood. Once you have it, look for a small glade west of the road near the Felwood border. . . the chest should be hidden around there. "
3263,Raene's Cleansing,Find the Glowing Gem and return to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar with Teronis' Journal. ,"As you rummage through Teronis' belongings, you find a journal that is still in good condition. You take the journal and leave Teronis' corpse as is. The only thing left to do is find the gem Teronis was seeking. Raene mentioned it being in the area. Perhaps the murlocs have it. . . "
3264,Supplies to Auberdine,Speak with Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post after seeing Feero safely through Ashenvale Forest. ,"Delgren has asked me to deliver messages and supplies to Sentinel Starbreeze in Auberdine, but I am loathe to leave on my own. Dangerous foes operate in the forest, and I do not wish to risk letting these supplies and information fall into the wrong hands. If you and others could act as my guards, I could leave now. With your protection, I have no doubt that we can see these goods safely to Auberdine. "
3265,Bathran's Hair,Bring 5 Bathran's Hair to Orendil Broadleaf in Ashenvale. ,"There is a plant that once grew in the old ruins of Bathran's Haunt to the north.  The plant was called Bathran's Hair and was known to cure ailments of the spirit. There is a sick child in the village, and I believe it is more than just a physical illness.  Will you go to Bathran's Haunt and search it for Bathran's Hair?  I may need it to properly treat the child. Bathran's Haunt lies north of Maestra's Post and just south of the border to Darkshore. "
3266,An Aggressive Defense,"Kill 1 Den Watcher, 2 Ursas, 10 Totemics, and 12 Warriors of the Foulweald tribe, and then return to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar. ","Before you travel to the moonwell I have another task that will aid the people of Ashenvale if you would like to test your skills. Along the road heading east before the Falfarren River, furbolgs have been attacking travelers. Their tortured minds feeding upon fear, and their appetites satiated by the blood of innocents. Aid the Sentinels in protecting the lands by showing those monsters the same mercy they have shown our kind. I believe their camps are south of the road. . . be careful. "
3267,Elune's Tear,Bring Elune's Tear to Pelturas in Astranaar. ,"I had hoped Orendil's cure would save Relara, but I fear it only slowed the disease running through my child.  We must find more powerful medicine!  Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies to try should his first one fail. Elune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the isle on Iris Lake, east of Astranaar.  Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption. . . please, <name>, bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness! "
3268,The Ashenvale Hunt,There are three legendary creatures that make up the Ashenvale Hunt; you may seek them and test yourself against their cunning and might. ,"There are three legendary creatures that make up the Ashenvale Hunt; you may seek them and test yourself against their cunning and might.  In the process, you will hopefully learn something about yourself.  The creatures are: the bear Ursangous, the nightsaber cat Shadumbra, and the hippogryph Sharptalon. The creatures of the Ashenvale Hunt are powerful, and you may find that you'll need aid in bringing them down.  If you should best them, bring me proof of your deed. "
3269,Sharptalon's Claw,"Bring Sharptalon's Claw to Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale. ","The mighty hippogryph Sharptalon has been slain, with the claw of the felled beast serving as a testament to your victory.

3270,Travel to Astranaar,Travel to Astranaar in Ashenvale and speak with Vindicator Palais. ,"I am glad that you are here to help.  In fact, there is something that you can do. As part of our inclusion within the Alliance, I would like for you to travel to the night elf town, Astranaar.  It is located in Ashenvale, a large forest that is south of Darkshore on the continent of Kalimdor. Please speak with Vindicator Palais when you arrive to see if there's anything that you can do to help the inhabitants. "
3271,Journey to Stonetalon Peak,Travel to Keeper Albagorm on Stonetalon Peak. ,"The forest spirits tell me you are brave and willing to travel. To the south, not far from Mystral Lake, there lies a tunnel named The Talondeep Path. Through this tunnel you will come to an area known as Windshear Crag in the Stonetalon Mountains. Once there, journey to the southwest past Cragpool Lake and then north, up the steep slope until you reach Stonetalon Peak. There awaits Keeper Albagorm. Heed his bidding, <race>. The journey will be perilous. "
3272,A Shameful Waste,Bring 15 pieces of Warsong Lumber and 5 Satyrnaar Fel Wood to Gnarl at Forest Song. ,"Welcome to Forest Song, <class>. Where you see tents, there will one day be buildings, but such ambitions require a steady stream of building materials. I cannot bring myself to order our workers to fell any of the ancient trees of this grove, but our neighbors to the south and west have no such reverence for the forest. We shall relieve the Warsong loggers of their excess, and reclaim some of the tainted wood from the satyr stronghold to the west. Bring the wood to Gnarl, who will purify it for our use. "
3273,Report from the Northern Front,Deliver Sentinel Luciel's report to Sentinel Farsong at Silverwing Grove. ,"The battle against the Warsong Lumber Camp isn't being waged from Forest Song alone, <name>. There's a more substantial Silverwing Sentinel presence at Silverwing Grove to the southwest, near the border with the Barrens. From the grove, Sentinel Farsong directs our efforts against those who would destroy our lands. I'm a bit late in sending my latest report to Sentinel Farsong, but also hesitant to leave Forest Song unattended. If your travels take you near Silverwing Grove, would you deliver my report? "
3274,Raene's Cleansing,"Find an uncorrupted furbolg, and using the power of Dartol's Rod of Transformation, speak to him. ","Alas, I'm not completely certain what he had in mind next. If what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether. Which form, I do not know. Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to the tainted furbolgs, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was safe from the effects of Fel Moss. I would start your search southeast of Mystral Lake. "
3275,Passage to Booty Bay,Take a boat to Booty Bay and speak with Caravaneer Ruzzgot. ,"Ah yes, finally found it. Should have told me she passed through here that long ago. Let's see. Velinde. Booked passage to Booty Bay on the Black Osprey. I don't have anything here saying otherwise, so I'd assume it arrived in port safely. Not much more help I can be to you, but she asked about overland travel over on that side of the world, and I mentioned Ruzzgot, a caravan driver based out of Booty Bay. Might be that this Velinde traveled with him. Move along, now. I haven't all day for you. "
3276,Troll Charm,Bring 8 Troll Charms to Mitsuwa at the Zoram'gar Outpost. ,"My kinfolk were traveling here with many sacred troll charms, but the Thistlefur furbolgs attacked and killed them before they reached Zoram'gar!  Those vile Furbolgs! I miss my brothers and sisters who were killed, but we will meet again in the afterlife.  However, their troll charms hold great value in this world.  It is an outrage that the furbolgs have them! <name>, you must retrieve the charms!  They are in chests in Thistlefur Hold, a cave at the end of Thistlefur Village, north of Astranaar. "
3277,Diabolical Plans,Deliver the Diabolical Plans to Valusha at Splintertree Post in Ashenvale. ,"The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Orcish tongue!  The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts. The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Splintertree Post to the northwest. You're certain that Valusha at Splintertree Post would be interested in these. "
3278,The Ancient Statuette,"Bring the Ancient Statuette to Talen, in his camp near the Zoram Strand. ","I would charge you with a task, <name>. I was on my small vessel, skimming over the submerged ruins of Zoram, when naga attacked me, surging from the water and tearing at me with their claws!  I fled, carrying what supplies I could to make this meager camp. But when I reached the shore and ran. . . my prized possession was lost. Please, <name>, find the site of my ambush, along the coast to the north, and search for an ancient statuette.  It is the reason I have braved the dangers of the Zoram Strand. "
3279,The Caravan Road,Speak with Clerk Daltry in Darkshire. ,"Turns out I was wrong about you, and that isn't something that happens everyday. It just so happens that I remember this Velinde you're looking for. Isn't every day that a night elf priestess that wants to travel with a dirty old--but great for your shipping needs! --caravan like my own. We split up on the way north, she was headed for Darkshire. The clerk there keeps all sorts of records. Might know something useful. Be careful in the jungle, it is a deadly place even at the best of times. "
3280,Amongst the Ruins,"Bring the Fathom Core to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale. ","The Twilight's Hammer has moved into the Moonshrine Ruins of Blackfathom Deeps.  Their presence can only serve to coerce the elements into working against us.  If left unchecked, this region will be theirs for good. <name>, go into Blackfathom and find the ruin's fathom stone; it should be somewhere close in the water.  In it is a fathom core - a device that when properly read it will relate a history of all elemental activity.  If I have it, I and the Earthen Ring can maybe do something to stop them! "
3281,The Branch of Cenarius,Kill Geltharis and return the Branch of Cenarius to Illiyana at Forest Song. ,"Anilia puts her hands on your shoulders and draws you close. Gasping, she points towards the arch to the north, before her eyes close and her last wheezing breath leaves her body. ""He has taken it. . . Geltharis. . . "" You know in your heart that Anilia 's dying wish is to see the Branch of Cenarius back in dryad hands. "
3282,Diabolical Plans,Deliver the Diabolical Plans to Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song in Ashenvale. ,"The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Common tongue!  The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts. The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Forest Song to the north; the location where a new draenei settlement is being established. Perhaps Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song would be interested in these? "
3283,The Ruins of Stardust,Bring 5 Handfuls of Stardust to Pelturas in Astranaar. ,"Elune's Tear washed clear some of my daughter's sickness.  Her nightmares are lessened and I thank the goddess for her blessing.  But. . . fever still rages within her. Orendil told me of a frosted dust found among the Ruins of Stardust.  Perhaps it will abate Relara's fever.  Gather some of the dust, then please return to me. The Ruins of Stardust lie to the south, <name>.  May Elune speed your journey. "
3284,Raene's Cleansing,"Kill Ran Bloodtooth, 4 Bloodtooth Guards and collect Ran Bloodtooth's Skull. ","The night elves are as old as time, but their arrogance destroys their very world. And now it destroys our lives too. But that can no longer be controlled. . . I blame the elves for much, but we are still responsible for our actions. Even beyond the corruption, we are capable of great evil. Ran Bloodtooth is one such evil. Power hungry, lusting. . . the corruption has only made him stronger. My hatred for the elves burns, but I do not wish ill upon their children, so we must police our own. "
3285,Raene's Cleansing,Return to Shael'dryn at the moonwell. ,"The rod, now complete, lies in your hands. Shael'dryn will want to hear of your success. "
3287,On Guard in Stonetalon,Speak to Gaxim in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"The situation here in Stonetalon is obviously grave for a night elf and gnome to be working together. The Venture Co. has devastated these lands and I've spent most of my time putting an end to the destruction. Do not judge Gaxim prematurely; he understands the need for us to work together. If you wish to aid us, then start by speaking to Gaxim. I'm sorry I cannot send you back to Tara with good news yet. Perhaps soon. "
3288,Torek's Assault,"Escort Torek on his attack against Silverwing Outpost and Duriel Moonfire, then report to Ertog Ragetusk at Splintertree Post. ","Hey!  <class>!  Come here! My raiders and I are about to attack the Silverwing Outpost to the west.  Our target is its leader, Duriel Moonfire.  Scouts report the outpost is defended heavily with sentinels and warriors.  The battle will be glorious! Do you want to share in the glory, <name>, and aid us?  If so, then when it's over you can report our success to my superior, Ertog Ragetusk in Splintertree. What do you say.  Are you with us? "
3289,Raene's Cleansing,Return to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar. ,"I suggest you find Raene and let her know the rod is finished. I'm sure she'll know what your next course should be. Good luck, <name>. "
3290,Velinde's Effects,"Search through Velinde's chest for her journal, then return it along with the key to Thyn'tel Bladeweaver in Darnassus. ","The Tome of Mel'Thandris showed you this? I suppose there would be little harm in allowing you to examine her belongings. This key will allow you to open the chest where we stored her things in the Sentinels' bunkhouse. She kept a journal of her duties, if there is anything to be learned, it will be from that. I should tell you, the Sentinels believe that she had her own reasons for leaving, and expect that she could return at any time. The priestess has done much in the past to earn our trust. "
3291,Agents of Destruction,"Sentinel Luciel Starwhisper at Forest Song wants you to kill Overseer Gorthak, 2 Warsong Shredders, 5 Horde Deforesters, and 10 Horde Scouts. ","The Warsong Lumber Camp is a blight upon an embattled landscape. Every time we make progress in halting their operations, Overseer Gorthak orders his loggers to redouble their efforts! Now, the orcs are cutting more wood than they can possibly use, leaving it to rot while their blades bite into fresh trees! This is an affront to all we stand for, <name>, and we will show them that we'll not suffer further destruction of our lands! Go, and do not rest until Overseer Gorthak and his minions are dead! "
3292,A Helping Hand,Make your way to Forest Song and speak with Architect Nemos. ,"My people have undertaken an important endeavor in the eastern part of Ashenvale, with support and cooperation from the kaldorei. Under the supervision of Architect Nemos and Vindicator Vedaar, they are revitalizing an old night elf outpost. The task of building won't be easy, <name>, for the challenges and enemies they face are many. I know Architect Nemos and his compatriots at Forest Song would appreciate any help they can get, and he has asked me to send any interested <men/women> his way. "
3293,The Hunt Completed,"&lt; name&gt; , you have slain all three beasts that comprise the Ashenvale Hunt. ","<name>, you have slain all three beasts that comprise the Ashenvale Hunt.  You have brought me adequate proof of their demise; there is no question of your strength and tenacity.  The blood of a hunter streaks through your veins, and you should be commended! Please, accept this bauble as a sign of congratulations on your mighty deeds done in Ashenvale for the Horde today.  May your ancestors watch over you! "
3294,Ursangous's Paw,"Bring Ursangous's Paw to Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale. ",The paw of the mighty bear Ursangous is your trophy for this part of the Ashenvale Hunt.  On the paw is a small quarter-crescent emblem; the significance of the emblem remains a mystery. The paw should be brought to Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post to prove that you have bested the mighty creature and completed this portion of the hunt. 
3295,Reclaiming Felfire Hill,Plant 8 Tree Seedlings in the Fertile Dirt Mounds and then return to Gnarl at Forest Song in Ashenvale. ,"Little one, to the south is an area of Nightsong Woods that has in recent times come to be called Felfire Hill.  It is very sad to see the demons crawling over it, spreading their corruption. Would you do something to help take back the land? I have a number of seeds that I have been saving for such a purpose.  Take them to Felfire Hill and plant them in the fertile dirt mounds. "
3296,The Carevin Family,Speak with Jonathan Carevin in Darkshire. ,"No, I don't have any records of a Velinde Starsong staying in Darkshire. . . though, if you don't mind me saying, I can hardly imagine a night elf priestess taking a room in the inn, if you get my meaning? These wolf-men you mentioned though, that's something I've heard about. Just the other day, Calor came into town with a string of their heads. He works with the Carevin family. Hunters of demons, undead, and other monstrosities. Speak with Jonathan, he's the head of the household. "
3297,On Guard in Stonetalon,Find Kaela Shadowspear overlooking the valley entering Windshear Crag in the Stonetalon Mountains. ,"Hello, <name>. You seem to be full of wanderlust by the looks of you. Have you been to the Stonetalon Mountains? It is a land plagued by the Venture Co. and other enemies of the night elves. Recently, Sentinel Wolfrunner sent my friend Kaela Shadowspear there to investigate what's happening to the land, but I have yet to hear word back from her. I'm even more concerned because the Alliance sent a gnome mage along with her. . . a sign of trouble for sure. Would you find her and report back to me? "
3298,Velinde Starsong,Speak with Thyn'tel Bladeweaver at the Warrior's Terrace in Darnassus. ,"Velinde Starsong was my predecessor here in Ashenvale Forest. At first it seemed she had the situation in Felwood under control, but little by little her efforts faltered. One day, she simply disappeared. I was sent here to continue her work. I'm afraid I know nothing of the priestess, however. Perhaps Thyn'tel Bladeweaver, one of the commanders of the Sentinels, knows further details of her disappearance that I was not a party to. Surely she will understand the import of such information. "
3299,Ashenvale Outrunners,"Kill 9 Ashenvale Outrunners, then return to Kuray'bin at Splintertree Outpost. ","We received reports that Ashenvale outrunners left Silverwing Outpost not long ago, and now sneak near our territories in the forest.  We don't want them gathering intelligence on our defenses! Sneak through the forests south of our post here and east of the Alliance outpost of Silverwing.  Find and slay the outrunners, then return to me. "
3300,Forsaken Diseases,Bring a Bottle of Disease to Kayneth Stillwind in Forest Song. ,"The Forsaken, the undead arm of the Horde, have crept into Ashenvale, lurking at our ruins and our barrows.  We believe their goal is to spread disease amongst the lands of the night elves.  We must confirm this! The Forsaken have a camp south of here, near the Dor'Danil Barrow Den, where they create poisons and diseases and place them in bottles.  Fight your way into that camp and steal a bottle of disease.  Return with such a bottle.  I will test it and find its purpose. "
3301,Vile Satyr! Dryads in Danger! ,Find Anilia in Xavian in Ashenvale. ,"Listen, I don't know who you are, but I need your help. My sisters went to take back the Branch of Cenarius from the satyr. They said they'd be back soon, but it's been two whole days! <name>, you have to find them! They were looking for the ruins of a night elf temple in Xavian to the northwest.

I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days. After asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those satyrs. . . but you look like you might be! Tell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time. "
3305,Destroy the Legion,"Slay 6 Mannoroc Lashers, 6 Felguards and 6 Searing Infernals, and then return to Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song in Ashenvale. ","I will not tolerate their existence on this world!  The Burning Legion all but destroyed our race and we fell back to settle a new home on a new world.  Then they came again.  And we retreated, over and over. No more! There is a remnant of the Legion to the south in the regions known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge.  They are what is leftover from a force that once long ago invaded this world. Go and destroy as many as you can before it is too late! "
3306,Freedom to Ruul,"Escort Ruul, then speak with Yama Snowhoof in Splintertree Post. ","Eh?  Who are you? <name>?  You're no furbolg.  They are cursed!

You must take the tempered azsharite to one with the ability to harness fel energy. In Stranglethorn Vale such a blacksmith exists.

3318,Poisoned Water,Use the Aspect of Neptulon on poisoned elementals of Eastern Plaguelands. ,"A force of elemental scouts was sent to the eastern plaguelands of Lordaeron, and the disease of that place twisted and infected them.  The Waterlords cannot allow this affront to our purity! Take this vial.  In it is a quantity of one aspect of Neptulon.  If used on the plagued elementals it will fight the poison within their bodies and cure them!  But their inner conflict will drive them into a surging madness. Defeat the discordant surges and bring me their bracers of binding. "
3319,Azsharite,Recover twenty Crystallized Azsharite from southern Azshara. ,"The ancient cliff giants of the southern region of Azshara consume the rock and buildings of the land for sustenance. The excrement from their consumption is a highly malleable and extremely strong crystal known as Azsharite. The formations litter the southern arc, but few are ever recovered due to the extremely violent nature of the giants. You are to venture south and recover enough of the Azsharite for the creation of the weapon's body. My felhounds will aid in the recovery of the crystal. "
3320,A Crew Under Fire,"Defend Captain Vanessa Beltis, her crew and the Horizon Scout's passengers against the naga attack. ","We were just off the coast looking for a safe haven to make anchor. The sun hadn't been down for more than an hour when they attacked. . . those damned naga! I'm not sure what they were looking for, but it's clear they didn't find it--they've already come back once.

Cause that's how business is done: you prove you're a valuable employee and then you're rewarded adequately after you stick it out some. If you're a ""valuable"" employee, then hit the Ruins of Eldarath and find me some rune that them Blood elves were lookin' for. The naga apparently have it in their possession. "
3325,The Name of the Beast,Speak with Lord Arkkoroc in Azshara. ,"There is only one way to harm the demon lord and his minions. A weapon of power must be forged bearing his true name. When such a weapon is forged, the demon and all under his command are vulnerable. A lesser deity resides in Azshara: Lord Arkkoroc.

Before I left, I did some research and you would be surprised how many valuable items are lying around. I'll tell you more about my deals, and even give you a cut of the profits, if you help me gather some of them. There are tablets throughout the Ruins of Eldarath to the east that I need.

3327,Breaking the Ward,Wait for Loramus to complete the enlightenment spell. ,"You are foolhardy, <name>. It is an admirable quality of your kind - to blindly enter battle when you have little to no chance of success. I will assist you, if only to see just one of Razelikh's minions fall. To break the ward placed over Razelikh's subordinates will take time and require the acquisition of rare artifacts. Be still, I must first perform the enlightenment ritual.

3328,The Name of the Beast,Take the temper back to Loramus Thalipedes. ,"As promised, I will reveal the name of the demon lord, Razelikh the Defiler.

I guess I may have forgotten that little tidbit. According to my superior psycho-psionic clairvoyance, you'll find that the best spot to cast this buoy is off the coast of Azshara, in the Bay of Storms.

3331,Eye of the Emberseer,Bring the Eye of the Emberseer to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara. ,"You have shown me that you can defeat our enemies and perform missions to further the cause of the Waterlords.  But until now you have only faced lesser foes. . . if pitted against a powerful enemy, can you prevail? That is your new task. High up in Blackrock Spire the orcs have captured a servant of fire, the Pyroguard Emberseer.  Find his place of imprisonment, slay his captors, and then slay the emberseer.

Do you know what Kim'jael means to the Blood elves, <name>? Little rat. . . or something like that. The big bullies! They hired me to help them scout the area looking for some sort of lost treasures. Of course I jumped aboard the moment they said ""treasure"" and the amount they were willing to pay, but of course, they turned on me and tried to kill me. . . ME!

I cannot speak for the night elves when it comes to all the atrocities those demonic creatures have committed, but I have sworn an oath to the Earthmother to aid the elves in ridding the land of such a nuisance. I am sure you would prove yourself if you aided me in purging them. Northeast of here, you can find the Haldarr clan. Return to me after you've tested yourself against their power. "
3334,A Hero's Reward,Claim your reward from Hydraxis' Coffer. ,"<name>, your services to the Warlords surpassed all we could expect from the denizens of this world. We do not understand your people's notions of gratitude, or rewarding good works, but in this case. . . perhaps a reward is warranted.

It is upsetting to me, but I do not question his orders.  I can only take enjoyment in making fun of the ridiculous clothes you wear or the pathetic look on your face.  Even that bores me. . . Even this rambling bores me!  Do you wish to see my master or not? "
3339,Delivery to Archmage Xylem,Bring the Tablet of Sael'hai to Archmage Xylem in Azshara. ,"This final tablet goes to someone very dangerous, <name>. Heed me when I tell you that I trust this person far less than anyone else I've asked you to meet with. Archmage Xylem has a tower up in the hills overlooking Azshara. He's human, but he acts like no human I've met. . . or killed. He exudes power, and I dare not ask him what he plans on doing with the tablet. He came to me, but told me that his bodyguard Sanath would help me get to the tower when I was ready to meet him. Look north for Sanath. "

","If you truly wish an allegiance with us, then I invite you to wage war on our foes, the servants of air and earth and fire.

3342,Spiritual Unrest,Destroy 6 Highborne Apparitions and 6 Highborne Lichlings before returning to Loh'atu in Azshara. ,"Long ago, the Highborne were some of the most powerful students of the arcane the night elves ever produced. The corruption that comes along with such studies caused much harm to night elf society and greatly affected all of Azeroth. . . as I'm sure you well know. I promised the Sentinels that I would release the spirits from their mortal bonds as I find them. If you would do the same, then I am sure I can reward you some. The spirits haunt the Shadowsong Shrine to the northeast of here. "
3343,Hands of the Enemy,"Bring the Hands of Lucifron, Sulfuron, Gehennas and Shazzrah to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara. ","<name>, your service is of great value to us, so we are reluctant to send you on this last mission for we do not want to lose such a useful agent. But its success would further our war efforts tremendously and. . . it was deemed worth risking you. We want these captains in the Molten Core destroyed: Lucifron, Sulfuron, Gehennas and Shazzrah.

What a wonderful day! I am so honored to have you grace me with your presence. Thank you! Please. . . do not be so arrogant to assume my sarcasm was a compliment. Let us get one thing straight: I don't like you. But this little conversation doesn't have anything to do with us--it has to do with my master.

3354,Return Trip,I will return you to Sanath's camp now. ,I will return you to Sanath's camp now. Do not mind his bad manners--he is rude to everyone save for the master. Perhaps he shall learn his lesson one day. 
3356,Delivery to Jes'rimon,Bring the Tablet of Jin'yael to Jes'rimon in Orgrimmar. ,"I have a fence in Orgrimmar. He resides in The Drag. He's difficult to nail down if you don't know where to look, but if you go looking in one of the highest buildings there you should have no problem finding him. Do me a favor though, don't go shouting to all of Kalimdor that he's there and what his business is--it'd be bad for both of us. He'll give us more than a fair price for the Tablet of Jin'yael. I'm not sure why, but you should have seen how excited he was to hear about its whereabouts. "
3359,Delivery to Andron Gant,Bring the Tablet of Markri to Andron Gant in Undercity. ,Andron Gant is my next contact. He usually holds himself up in the Undercity. . . right near the Apothecarium. He was a little more loose-lipped when it came to speaking about what he wanted the Tablet for. Apparently some of the mages of Undercity are looking to study some of the arcane spells the highborne used. They think this tablet will help them. Markri was adept at summoning creatures; especially elementals. Take the Tablet of Markri and return to me for your part of the reward. 
3360,Delivery to Magatha,Bring the Tablet of Beth'Amara to Magatha in Thunder Bluff. ,"The first tablet goes to a tauren female. . . one called Magatha. She is among the elders in Thunder Bluff, and is one of the proponents of the alliance between the tauren and the Forsaken. She, more than anyone among the elders, feels the tauren and their ways can help the Forsaken find a path back to being human. Bring her the Tablet of Beth'Amara.

3364,Rescue the Survivors! ,"Use your Gift of the Naaru ability on one of the Draenei Survivors spread throughout Ammen Vale, then return to Zalduun at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ","The healing crystals are replenished, but that is not the only way we can help the injured. All draenei can tap the gift of the Naaru to heal. You must use this ability to heal one of the crash survivors. You'll find most of the survivors in the areas to the west and northwest, but the crash scattered us all over the vale. The survivors have suffered from exposure to the irradiated power crystals, so you should be able to find them by the red glow that surround them. You must save them, <name>. "
3365,Tree's Company,Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to observe the meeting that is to take place between Geezle and the traitor. ,"According to the plans, the traitor and the leader of the goblins, Geezle, are to meet at a cove on the western island. I need you to be at that meeting, <name>. Remember the tree and leaves? You're going to wear them! It's a perfect disguise. Go to the cove and look for a naga flag. If the flag is there, it means a meeting is planned. Use the disguise kit when you see the flag and wait. Eventually the traitor will show up. Let the meeting finish then return to me with the identity of the scoundrel. "
3366,The Prophecy of Velen,Daedal wants you to travel south and seek out the people that the injured creature mentioned. ,"The Prophet spoke of this day: That on this island, in this new world, our allies would find us. ""We will be tested. They will ask that we pay for the sins of our fathers. . . ""At the time, I did not understand the meaning behind his words, but seeing this creature and her reaction to us, it is now coming into focus. The corruption of our people has been felt even here. Venture south. It is there that we found this being. Find its kin and tell them of our people. "
3367,Search Stillpine Hold,Search Stillpine Hold for clues. ,"As High Chief, my immediate concern is the root of the corruption in Stillpine Hold. Why did the wildkin - once our allies - attack us?

3368,Botanical Legwork,Gather 3 Corrupted Flowers and return them to Apprentice Vishael at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"The Ammen Fields to the west are the primary breeding ground of the local lasher population. With the corruption of the water table from the nearby lake, Botanist Taerix is worried that the lashers will not be able to repopulate themselves once we've cleansed the lake. Go to the Ammen Fields and pick some of the corrupted flowers for me so that I might take a look at them and see what can be done. You should be able to identify them by their uncharacteristic red petals. "
3369,A Cry For Help,Escort Magwin through the island to her home. ,"My family was attacked by the murlocs and owlkin of this island several weeks ago. I managed to escape but I think that both my mother and father have been slain. I don't know what I'm going to do now, but I must try and get back to my home - or what's left of it. . .

With just a rudimentary understanding of how their symbols work, we can study the totems and learn to communicate with the furbolgs. I've written down the basics of the symbol matrix on this parchment. Study it and then examine the totem. It should lead you to the next language totem. Speak to Arugoo when you return an educated <race>! "
3371,The Great Moongraze Hunt,Bring 6 Moongraze Stag Tenderloins to Acteon at Azure Watch. ,"You're starting to make a name for yourself, <name>. How about trying your hand at hunting? Back on Draenor, our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a talbuk.

3375,All That Remains,Cowlen on Azuremyst Isle wants you to recover the Remains of Cowlen's Family. ,"We had lived peacefully among the Owlbeasts of this island for many years. You can imagine my surprise when they stormed the beach and attacked us. I fought tooth and nail but was easily overpowered. As I blacked out from the vicious blows that I had been dealt, I prayed that my family not suffer. When I awoke, all was quiet. The sand was soaked red with blood - their blood.

They must see this for themselves. Perhaps they will be able to better understand some of what was written. "
3383,The Missing Scout,Find and speak with Tolaan at Shadow Ridge in Ammen Vale. ,"We now have several separate confirmations of unusual activity up on the Shadow Ridge.

3387,Inoculation,Use the Inoculating Crystal on 6 Nestlewood Owlkin. ,"Zhanaa needs our help to salvage parts from the Exodar.  Taerix prepared an inoculum that can be given to the Nestlewood owlkin that live in the area of a lot of the salvage. Just get close to the unaffected ones and use the crystal on them.  Unfortunately, you'll have to kill the others.  You'll find the owlkin at Nestlewood Thicket and Nestlewood Hills to the southeast. "
3388,Totem of Yor,Find the Totem of Yor using the clues provided to you. ,"The symbols on this totem seem to translate much faster. The patterns and imagery all seem to blend into familiar words. You are fairly certain the totem is pointing you south, down the river. Something is at the bottom of the river itself. "
3389,The Missing Fisherman,Find Cowlen at the southeast docks of Silvermyst Isle off the coast of Azuremyst. ,"In the fevered dreams of our injured guest, she spoke of a fisherman, Cowlen, who was in some distress at Silvermyst Isle, to the southwest, off the coast of Azuremyst. With all that has been happening, no one has had the opportunity to look into it, but I do feel a bit of worry. Perhaps there's something you can do, <name>? "
3390,Welcome! ,Bring the Azure Watch Gift Voucher to Jaeleil in Azure Watch. ,"Welcome to the World of Warcraft! As special thanks for purchasing the World of Warcraft Collector's Edition, turn in this gift voucher to Jaeleil in Azure Watch.

3391,What Must Be Done. . . ,Gather 10 Lasher Samples and return them to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"The nearby lake has been contaminated by one of the ship's power crystals.  Many of the plants and animals of Ammen Vale have been mutated because of this. I have a theory on how to heal the lake, but I must have samples from the mutated lashers for analysis.  They can be found to the west in the Ammen Fields. Will you help me, <class>? "
3392,Word from Azure Watch,Speak with Caregiver Chellan at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle. ,"<class>! A couple mutated beasts jumped me and my leg is injured. I was sent on a scouting mission from Azure Watch after we received word from Zhanaa. Please, could you go speak with Caregiver Chellan in my stead? She needs to know how many people to expect in Azure Watch. Just cross the Crystalbrook River here and continue following the road until you get to Azure Watch. Be sure to ask her for a place for yourself to stay in. "
3393,Red Snapper - Very Tasty! ,Use the Draenei Fishing Net to catch 10 Red Snappers. ,"I've found that these waters are bustling with red snapper, a very tasty fish. With a fishing net, I can catch enough to feed dozens of draenei! Unfortunately, I was recently attacked by a creature known as a murloc while netting in the river and have suffered some injuries that prevent me from doing my job. I need help! Use this fishing net near schools of red snapper, found in the Crystalbrook river to the east to catch the fish. What do you say? Remember to return the net when you are finished. "
3394,"Nightstalker Clean Up, Isle 2. . . ",Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch has asked that you slay 8 Infected Nightstalker Runts. ,"I'm not going to make any excuses for what you've found. This is clearly our fault. We had gotten reports of crushed crystal fragments showing up in the river to the east but chose to ignore the implications. Now we can either sit around on this island and cry about the tragedy that has befallen this land or we can do something about it and prevent it from spreading. If you've got the stomach for it, I want you to go back into the wilds and kill as many of the infected nightstalkers as you can find. "
3395,I've Got a Plant,Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him a Hollowed Out Tree and 5 Piles of Leaves. ,"I've wondered about this for some time now, but this proves it to be true. There is a traitor among us. The plans left behind by the goblins document the conspiracy. Since I don't know who it could be, I'm going to need your help in finding the traitor. None of my crew can be trusted. If this is going to work, I'm going to need a hollowed out tree and leaves. Search near the loggers north of us for the tree. You'll need to find the leaves by yourself. Check the forest. "
3396,The Kurken's Hide,Deliver the Kurken's Hide to Moordo at Stillpine Hold. ,"Take the Kurken's hide to Moordo, on the other side of the village. He will fashion the hide into an item of your choice. "
3397,Strange Findings,Deliver the Faintly Glowing Crystal to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch. ,The crystal you found on the nightstalker runt's body appears to be a piece of the Exodar. This may help explain the unusual appearance and demeanor of some of the animals in this region. Take the crystal back to Azure Watch. The exarch will surely want to know about this discovery. 
3398,Medicinal Purpose,Anchorite Fateema at Azure Watch wants you to bring her 8 Root Trapper Vines. ,"I have found that lashers milling about on the island hold restorative medicinal properties in their vines. Through proper treatment, the vines can be broken down into a powerful healing ointment. Unfortunately, with so many injured draenei passing through Azure Watch, we are always in short supply. Our delicate guest was found injured and unconscious by the Crystalbrook only yesterday. If you bring me vines, we may be able to save her. You will find root trappers both south and east of Azure Watch. "
3399,Warn Your People,Speak with Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch. ,"The Hold is saved and soon my people will make their way back to the ancestral home. The prophecy has come to pass and a new age of prosperity begins for the Stillpine. But I fear that darkness looms ahead for your own people. There are questions left unanswered - visions of prophecy unseen. Return to your leaders and tell them of what you have seen here. And Promised One, should you ever require the aid of Stillpine, you have merely to ask. "
3400,Rune Covered Tablet,Take the Rune Covered Tablet to Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle. ,You cannot make out any of the symbols on the tablet. Perhaps the priestess would be able to decipher the mysterious runes. 
3401,The Kurken is Lurkin',Kurz the Revelator at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill the Kurken and bring back the Kurken's Hide. ,"After the crystal storm had subsided, a beast of myth appeared in our village. Brought here by the invading wildkin, this beast, the Kurken, laid waste to our village. Many Stillpine were slain in defense of our lands by this fiend and many have since lost their lives attempting to subdue the beast. In my visions, I have seen one defeat the Kurken. The one must be you, <name>. You are our only hope. Enter Stillpine Hold and slay the Kurken. Bring me his hide as proof of deed. "
3402,Botanist Taerix,Speak with Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"<name>, Botanist Taerix is in need of your assistance. You'll find her with her apprentices to the west, outside the ship. "
3403,Blood Crystals,Speak with High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold. ,"On the surface, the crystal appears to be a piece of the Exodar. Something has gone terribly wrong with this crystal, however, as it is blood red and rapidly dissolving into the water supply of the cave. This may explain the unusually aggressive behavior of the creatures in Azuremyst. Return to High Chief Stillpine with this information. "
3404,You Survived! ,Speak with Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"Nevermind my injuries, <brother/sister>. It's a miracle that any of us are alive! It didn't look like you'd pull through; you've been in suspension for weeks. Something happened and the Exodar crashed. Many have died. But I'm relieved that you are alive, <name>. With you leading our efforts, I'm sure we'll get to safety soon! Proenitus asked me to send you to him when you awoke. He's waiting for you at the bottom of the hill. Just follow the path southwest. "
3405,Healing the Lake,"Disperse the Neutralizing Agent at the Irradiated Power Crystal, then return to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ","Thank goodness, I think it'll work!  I have an agent for you to spread at Silverline Lake to the south.  It will neutralize the effects of the irradiated ship's power crystal that fell there. Swim out and scatter the neutralizing agent near it.  Don't worry, you won't be exposed long enough to become irradiated. "
3406,Replenishing the Healing Crystals,Acquire 8 Vials of Moth Blood from the nearby Vale Moths and bring them to Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"We are the draenei.  Our ship crashed and, since we have many wounded, our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals.  We must replenish them quickly! Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths.  Their blood will make for a suitable substitute. The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but mostly in the northwest. "
3407,Stillpine Hold,Speak with High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold. ,"Promised one, you must travel north to the home of my people - Stillpine Hold. It is there that you will face your most daunting challenge. Go now, High Chief Stillpine awaits your arrival. "
3408,The Great Moongraze Hunt,Bring 6 Moongraze Buck Hides to Acteon at Azure Watch. ,"Well done, <name>! Well done! Now that you've cut your teeth with the moongraze stag, it's time you graduated to more formidable prey. Do not allow the casual disinterest of the moongraze bucks to fool you: when provoked, they are a fearsome foe. You'll find the bucks north of here. Good hunting. "
3409,The Prophecy of Akida,Free 8 Stillpine Captives from cages found in Bristlelimb Village. ,"The images on this totem depict a war between the Stillpine and the Bristlelimb furbolg tribes. The etchings show that the Bristlelimb have done unconscionable things to the furbolgs of Stillpine. Amidst the chaos, a prophecy has begun to unfold: A hero will rise - not of furbolg blood - and save the Stillpine tribe. Slay Bristlelimb furbolgs at Bristlelimb Village for their keys. Use the keys to free the Stillpine captives. Return to Arugoo of the Stillpine when you have freed them all! "
3410,Travel to Azure Watch,Speak with Technician Dyvuun at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle. ,"By all that is good, <name>, you must go at once to this Azure Watch and speak with Dyvuun! There is a path that leads west off of this tiny isle.  Follow it and cross the Crystalbrook River to arrive on the larger part of the isle.  Continue to follow the path and you should find Azure Watch. See if you can convince them to send us some aid and supplies.  The rest of us will follow when we can. Thank you, we wouldn't have made it without you! "
3411,Urgent Delivery! ,Deliver the Bundle of Vials to Zalduun at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"Now that you've gathered all that we need to replenish our healing crystals, I need you to deliver the vials to Zalduun, our priest.  You'll find him tending to our wounded inside the central chamber of the ship. "
3412,Murlocs. . . Why Here? Why Now? ,Gurf at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to recover 5 sacks of Stillpine Grain. ,"These are dark days, Promised One. Even the murlocs are kicking our tails - literally. Unfortunately, more than just my ego has been bruised. While our relationship with the Siltfin murlocs had always been tenuous, never could we have imagined that they would have the gall to attack us and steal from our food stores! Travel west to the Silting Shore and recover our stolen food-stuffs! And if you see a dark-skinned murloc with a patch of white fur stuck in between his webbed toes. . . "
3413,Replenishing the Healing Crystals,Acquire 8 Vials of Moth Blood from the nearby Vale Moths and give them to Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"Our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals.  We must replenish them quickly! Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths.  Their blood will make for a suitable substitute. The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but they are mostly concentrated in the northwest. "
3414,Reclaiming the Ruins,"Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill 5 Wrathscale Myrmidons, 5 Wrathscale Naga and 5 Wrathscale Sirens. ","While some may look at our current predicament as an unfortunate turn of events, I sense that we are here for a reason. The invisible hand of fate has pushed us in this direction. The reason why will become evident in time. To the west lies an ancient night elf city, now in ruin and overrun with naga. It would be remiss of me to sit idly by as the naga tainted my ancestral lands. You have shown yourself a capable <class>. Honor my people and cleanse the ruins of their unwelcome inhabitants. "
3415,Coming of Age,"Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch has asked that you deliver the Exarch's Orders to Torallius the Pack Handler, standing outside of the Exodar. ","You have survived the wilds of our new home and shown yourself a cut above the others. I believe that you have come of age to assist those battling on the front lines of Bloodmyst. The Hand of Argus could use a <race> like you. Report to Torallius the Pack Handler. You will find him outside the Exodar, tending to the elekk. Give him these orders so that he may direct you towards your new duties on Bloodmyst. "
3416,Totem of Coo,Find the Totem of Coo using the clues provided to you. ,"You begin to read the totem, barely able to pronounce the awkward words and phrases. Slowly, words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go up the nearby hill, to the northeast. "
3417,Vindicator Aldar,Speak with Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"With your help, we were able to find a solution to our problems faster than I could have hoped. I don't have any other work for you to do. My apprentices and I can handle the rest. You should go speak with Vindicator Aldar on the other side of the ship. "
3418,The Blood Elves,Kill 10 Blood Elf Scouts then return to Tolaan in the Shadow Ridge of Ammen Vale. ,You must eliminate. . . the blood elf. . . threat.  Find out. . . what they're. . . up to! They're on the. . . ridge behind me. 
3419,An Alternative Alternative,Daedal at Azure Watch wants you to bring him 5 Azure Snapdragon Bulbs. ,"The girl is too far gone for mere ointments to be effective. There may be another way. . . The forest of Azuremyst holds many secrets, one of those being a rare plant known as the azure snapdragon that some claim to be a panacea - a cure all. You can identify the plant by its stark contrast to the other plants of Azuremyst and its need to grow at the base of the azure pine trees. Make haste! And <name>, be wary of the root threshers of the region as they consume snapdragon for sustenance. "
3420,Volatile Mutations,"Kill 8 Volatile Mutations, then return to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ","The irradiated power cores from the Exodar have been wreaking havoc on the environment here. The most obvious effect has been the appearance of the strange creatures that seem to have sprung up near them. There may be something we can do to help them, but now, their sheer numbers are becoming too much for us to handle. I'd like you to go out and cull their numbers somewhat, and perhaps I'll have another idea after giving it some thought. "
3421,Blood Elf Spy,Slay Surveyor Candress and then inform Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"I have a plan. We must kill their leader. Without their master, perhaps they will retreat to regroup. We just need to buy time until the repairs are completed. Then Vindicator Aldar must know of this. Kill the surveyor, then return and tell him what we've found. "
3422,Chieftain Oomooroo,Stillpine the Younger at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to slay Chieftain Oomooroo and 9 Crazed Wildkin. ,"I am Stillpine the Younger, heir to the Stillpine legacy. As you can see, my defenders have set up a death trap for the raving wildkin that attack from inside Stillpine Hold. While we are able to hold them off out here, none of my defenders have been able to infiltrate the hold. If you could get inside and slay their leader, it might give us an opportunity to strike! Find Chieftain Oomooroo and destroy him. Slay any crazed wildkin that you encounter inside as well. "
3423,The Emitter,Speak with Technician Zhanaa at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale. ,"<name>, while you were out investigating the Shadow Ridge, Zhanaa here has been going on about the holographic emitter.  You might want to speak with her. "
3424,Precious and Fragile Things Need Special Handling,Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him 8 Ancient Relics. ,"The priestess tells me that the ruins to the west are what's left of a night elf civilization. That got me thinking about what my pappy used to always say about night elf ruins, ""Sonny, whenever you see night elf ruins, night elf relics are sure to be close by. ""Now what kind of a dwarf would I be if I didn't hire the first person I saw to go digging up night elf relics for me? Now get going! "
3425,The Unwritten Prophecy,These islands will serve as the home to thousands. ,"These islands will serve as the home to thousands. Most of these people will remain here their entire lives. If you so desired, you could do the same. But that's not what you want, is it, <name>? You will do many more great things before you pass. You must embrace your destiny and meet it head on! Before you leave, I present you with two gifts: This tabard is worn by only the most revered of the Hand of Argus and this signet ring worn by our wisest sages. Wear them both with pride, <name>. "
3426,Ending Their World,Follow and protect Demolitionist Legoso as he attempts to destroy the Vector Coil and slay Sironas. ,"Don't accept this assignment if you value your life. You see that gigantic power core jutting out of the mountain side over yonder? Whoever takes on this burden will need to fight their way through that mountain, battling an army of Sunhawks while protecting me as I rig the core up for demolition. Sironas the eredar is somewhere up there as well. I won't think less of you if you just walk away, <name>. But maybe you're the one - the one to destroy the Vector Coil and take down Sironas. Well, are you? "
3427,The Sun Gate,Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to destroy the Sun Gate. ,"Thanks to you and the work you did, my scouts were able to find the sun gate. The elves keep the portal location mobile so that they can move it at a moment's notice. That's why the site you investigated was empty. The strength of such a system is also its greatest weakness. The sun gate is stabilized by portal controllers. If we can take down the controllers, the portal will be ours to destroy. The current sun gate location can be found west of here, south of the Vector Coil. Find it and destroy it! "
3428,The Kessel Run,"Kessel at Kessel's Crossing wants you to warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing of the imminent blood elf invasion. ","You're just in time, <name>. Blood elf activity in this area has doubled in the past week. Our agents have informed us that the blood elves that call themselves Sunhawks plan to launch an offensive upon Azuremyst soon. I need you to get a warning out to our allies and compatriots. Warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing. Time is of the essence so I am lending you my elekk. Be sure to keep it out of water. "
3429,What We Know. . . ,Speak to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch. ,"We've learned much of our enemies in recent days. The blood elves are led by a being known as Sironas and plot to destroy us. Ultimately, they seek to enslave O'ros and regain control of the Exodar. Light be praised, we have stopped their supply line by destroying the sun gate. Unfortunately, they continue to use the contaminant of the Vector Coil to poison the land, using the mutagenic properties of the fallout to their advantage. With this knowledge, Admetius has devised a plan. Seek him out. "
3430,Pilfered Equipment,"Bring Clopper's Equipment back to Clopper Wizbang, who is hiding in a beached turtle shell. ","Shh! Keep your voice down and don't call attention to me. If the murlocs detect my presence, the experiment will be ruined! I've already come perilously close to contaminating my data. While I was foraging yesterday, one of them must've wandered too close and discovered my camp. I returned just in time to see two of them carrying off a crate with most of my equipment! It's bound to be in one of their settlements around here, but I can't risk revealing my presence. Are you willing to help? "
3431,Blood Watch,Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Spies. ,"Blood Watch is one of two forward bases operated by the Hand of Argus. You have already been to the other base, Azure Watch; things are completely different in Bloodmyst. When we first got here, the land was as beautiful as Azuremyst. We even called it Silvergale but now sickness is spreading across the land, worse yet, the blood elves that we were battling on the Exodar survived the crash. This brings me to your assignment: Venture northwest into Bladewood and terminate any blood elves that you find. "
3432,Salvaging the Data,Obtain the Survey Data Crystal from the Wrathscale near the dead cartographers and return it to Harbinger Mikolaas at Blood Watch. ,"It's too late to assist the cartographers in completing their mission, but it appears they collected the data Harbinger Mikolaas was expecting. The crystal storing their survey information was not among their ransacked packs, so it must be in the hands of the Wrathscale naga. You know that Harbinger Mikolaas will be saddened by the loss of the survey crew, but would want to salvage the survey data. "
3433,Signs of the Legion,"Kill 8 Nazzivus Satyr and 8 Nazzivus Felsworn, then bring Tzerak's Armor Plate to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch. ","The armor scrap is forged from a deep black metal that seems to absorb light. Although it doesn't appear to be enchanted, there is an unmistakable sense of wrongness about it. Such armor is only used by one force - the Burning Legion. The Legion's presence here can only mean that they're intending to mobilize the island's satyr against the draenei. Take action against the local satyr, then return to Blood Watch and show this armor scrap to Vindicator Aalesia. "
3434,Audience with the Prophet,Take the Translated Sunhawk Missive to Prophet Velen at the Exodar. ,"I need you to deliver the translated documents to Velen personally, <name>. I don't trust that deranged messenger. Explain to the Prophet that the blood elves are receiving reinforcements from the Outland and that they have a spy amongst the draenei at the Exodar. Velen resides in the Vault of Lights inside the Exodar. Make haste! "
3435,Irradiated Crystal Shards,Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to bring him 10 Irradiated Crystal Shards. ,"The Exodar's crash scattered pieces of fouled crystals all over Bloodmyst Isle, corrupting the water and the landscape. We've even begun finding pieces of the crystals inside the flesh of animals taken for meat. I've uncovered a way to purify the shard and turn them into functional crystals, so if you bring me enough shards, I'll trade one of my completed crystals for them. So far I've found the shards in the bodies of bears, ravagers, flutterers, and treants inhabiting the corrupted part of the island. "
3436,Galaen's Fate,Bring Galaen's Amulet to Morae at Blood Watch. ,"You have no means of identifying the corpse as Galaen with the information Morae gave you, but the clothing appears to have been torn in search of valuables. The blood elves in the area would've claimed anything of value from the wreckage, including Galaen's jeweled amulet. Although her husband did not survive the crash, you believe that Morae would be grateful if you recovered her husband's amulet from the blood elves. "
3437,Razormaw,Prince Toreth at Wyrmscar Island has asked that you slay Razormaw. ,"Many of the black dragonflight were slain during the attacks. One of them, a lieutenant of Deathwing himself, still haunts this place. If you look to the heavens, you can see his spectral countenance circling the skies. His hatred is so great that he remains even in death. Take the bones that you gathered for me earlier to the top of the mountain on this island and place them in the ever-burning pyre. This act should signal Razormaw to descend. When he does, slay his undead form. "
3438,Catch and Release,Morae at Blood Watch wants you to 'mark' 6 Blacksilt Scouts using the Murloc Tagger. ,"The Blacksilt murlocs on the southwestern coast are curious creatures. In some ways, they act barely sentient, yet in others, they show a remarkable degree of organization. I have a few theories about that, but no real way to test them until recently. I've devised a method that will allow me to track the murlocs I'm interested in without doing any lasting harm or interfering with their natural behavior. If you're willing to help with the marking, I'll gladly pay you for your assistance. "
3439,Intercepting the Message,"Kill Sunhawk elves until you find the Sunhawk Missive, then return it to Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch. ","It is good to see you again, <name>. I have a quandary that you might be able to solve. Our agents situated behind Sunhawk lines have reported seeing Sunhawk soldiers parsing an unusual document. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in acquiring a copy of the document for ourselves. I need you to go out in the field and try to recover the document. I am certain that if you apply enough pressure, a Sunhawk agent will turn over the information we seek. I leave the use of force to your discretion. "
3440,The Way to Auberdine,Take the boat from the dock near Huntress Kella Nightbow to Auberdine. ,"If you wait out on the dock, you'll see the boat arriving from the port of Auberdine in Darkshore. Once it has offloaded its passengers, you'll be able to board. After a short journey, the boat will put in at Auberdine and you'll be able to deliver your message. It's probably best to take this to Thundris Windweaver, an old friend of mine and a well-respected citizen of the town. "
3441,Saving Princess Stillpine,Release Princess Stillpine from her cage and then speak with Stillpine Ambassador Olorg at Blood Watch. ,"Help me, <name>! The Bristlelimb captured me and are planning to sacrifice me to their foul gods! High Chief Bristlelimb holds the key that opens the cage. To force him to appear, you must slaughter the evil Bristlelimb furbolgs that inhabit the enclave, just two camps to the west of this camp. If you kill enough of them, he will surely come for vengeance! When he shows up, kill him and get the key! My father will richly reward you if you can save me! "
3442,Cruelfin's Necklace,Bring the Red Crystal Pendant to Morae at Blood Watch. ,"Examining the crudely constructed pendant, you notice the crystal pulsating softly. Though it emits little light, you can almost feel the crystal radiating a sense of wrongness. You're not quite sure what might have possessed Cruelfin to create this pendant, but the find is too important to ignore. You should probably show it to someone at Blood Watch. "
3443,Declaration of Power,Kessel at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle wants you to kill Lord Xiz at Wrathscale Lair and drive the Draenei Banner through his dead body. ,"Have you seen the serpent men? The ones that call themselves naga? < Kessel spits. >They dared make an advance upon this camp under cover of darkness only three nights ago. Can you believe the audacity of those primitive beasts? I need you to deliver a message to their leadership, <name>. To the northeast is Wrathscale Lair, home to Lord Xiz. Find him, slay him where he stands and drive this banner through his corpse. Let them know fear whenever they should see our standard! "
3444,The Hopeless Ones. . . ,Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to recover 4 Bloodcursed Souls. ,"On a ledge of the reef, deeper than where you found the bloodcursed naga, you will find the hopeless ones: The bloodcursed voyagers, ghosts of those taken by the bloodcurse. It is regrettable, what I ask of you now. . . but they must be destroyed and their cursed shells brought back to me. Their souls must be put to rest. Return to me when you have done as asked and I shall give you one final task. "
3445,The Final Sample,Get an Axxarian Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Axxarien Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,"There's just one sample remaining before I can send this set of crystals to the Exodar, <name>. The final sample must come from the satyr stronghold of Axxarien to the northwest. I'm not certain what to expect from this crystal sample, but I'm sure there will be some signs of corruption. Take care to mine your shard from the crystal that looks like the ones you took your previous samples from, or else our researchers cannot make a valid comparison. "
3446,WANTED: Deathclaw,Bring Deathclaw's Paw to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,By order of Harbinger Mikolaas: A bounty of 18 silver to be paid to the brave soul who returns with proof of the marauding bear Deathclaw's demise. Deathclaw should be considered extremely dangerous and is responsible for the killing of a survey team on the coast to the northwest of Blood Watch. Travelers are advised to avoid the area. 
3447,Learning from the Crystals,Get an Impact Site Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Impact Site Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,"Welcome to Blood Watch, <class>. Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the Exodar. The problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island. The first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge. "
3448,"Explorers' League, Is That Something for Gnomes? ",Find Clopper Wizbang camped in an old turtle shell on the shore north of Blood Watch. ,"Babysitting! Would you believe it? They pulled me out of a promising dig and sent me along with Captain Odesyus' expedition to babysit that little gnome! I'd never heard o' a gnome wanting to become a prospector before, so I asked. Seems we are takin' gnomes now, and this particular one has a fascination with murlocs! Well, he's gone off and set up shop in an old turtle shell on the northern shore of the island. Go and have a look if you don't believe me! "
3449,Culling the Flutterers,Tracker Lyceon at Blood Watch wants you to kill 10 Royal Blue Flutterers. ,"When we first encountered flutterers, they showed few signs of mutation. As the corruption got progressively worse, the moths and other species began to show signs of contamination. It has progressed to the point where they damage nearly everything they come in contact with. They're amplifying the damage being done by the crystal shards scattered by the Exodar's crash. We have no choice but to begin culling their population in the lands north of Blood Watch. "
3450,A Map to Where? ,Locate the pavilion described by the map and search for what the map's maker was trying to record. ,"The crudely-drawn map reveals nothing of its maker, but it appears to have been drawn with an unsteady hand. Wavering lines and symbols depict a small pavilion with broken columns located to the west of a partially submerged tower. If the map is to be believed, this cluster of ruins appears to be located on the eastern coast of the island. You have no idea what you'll find, but it was important enough for the map's creator to record. "
3451,The Bloodcurse Legacy,Admiral Odesyus has asked that you find and speak with Captain Edward Hanes. ,"Dear friend, My hand trembles as I ink this letter. I pray that it reaches you in time. Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship 'Lost Hope', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago. This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of your base? Regards, Admiral Odesyus"
3452,The Cryo-Core,Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to recover 12 boxes of Medical Supplies. ,"We have others pursuing leads on the sun portals, <name>. I need you to focus on the task at hand. Boros has received new reports of another crash site. What we've since discovered is that the crash site is actually the Exodar's cryo-core. This is a pod holding area that houses pods exactly like the ones we draenei crawled out of in Ammen Vale. This area also holds medical supplies. Head to the Cryo-Core, directly west of Blood Watch. Search for supplies and search for survivors. "
3453,I Shoot Magic Into the Darkness,Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to locate the Sun Portal Site and slay 5 Void Anomalies. ,"Velen states that if the blood elves have been opening rifts between this island and the Outland, there will be residue or anomalies left in the areas where the portals have been opened. You must search the island for locations that exhibit or display these anomalies. Be warned, <name>; some of these anomalies will be creatures from the void itself. Should you find void anomalies, slay them! Report back to me with any new information that you may find. Begin your search to the north, near the Warp Piston. "
3454,Matis the Cruel,Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to capture Matis the Cruel. ,"Matis will be brought to justice, <name>; and I want you to be the one to find him and bring him back to the Triumvirate. Scour the island for this killer. Should you find him, use this flare gun. When my trackers see the flare, they'll come and assist in capturing Matis. Return to me after he's been captured. "
3455,Know Thine Enemy,Find the Nazzivus Monument in Nazzivian and retrieve a Nazzivus Monument Glyph. ,"It's good to see another new face here in Blood Watch, <class>. Although the blood elves are the most immediate threat, there are other sinister creatures that call Bloodmyst Isle home. The Nazzivus satyr are of particular concern. They are foul, demonic creatures, commanding dark magics and feeding on the corruption created by the Exodar's crash. We must hold them in check, but first we must learn more about them. Go southwest to Nazzivian and learn what you can from their grotesque monument. "
3456,Critters of the Void,Kill 12 Void Critters and report to Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch. ,"Aesom sent my squad out on a reconnaissance mission to search for the sun gate a few days ago. Needless to say, we found it. . . <Loryi points at Jorli. >Whatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released. The area is teaming with void critters. We must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies. You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate. Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done. "
3457,Ending the Bloodcurse,Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to destroy the Statue of Queen Azshara and kill Atoph the Bloodcursed. ,"To the south you will find Bloodcurse Isle. Atop the island you will find a shrine dedicated to the beloved queen of the naga, Azshara. Destroy the statue - burn it in effigy! This will surely draw the ire of Atoph, the Bloodcursed leader. Slay Atoph and return to me! "
3458,Limits of Physical Exhaustion,Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Pyromancers and 10 Sunhawk Defenders. ,"Victory is close at hand, <name>. With the discovery of the sun gate, it won't be long until their supply lines are completely closed off. Now is the time to strike at their numbers. To the west you will find numerous Sunhawk camps. The Sunhawk pyromancers and defenders occupy the vast majority of the area. Find them, kill them and return to me. "
3459,The Bear Necessities,Bring 8 Elder Brown Bear Flanks to Tracker Lyceon in Blood Watch. ,"As I'm sure you've seen in your time on Bloodmyst Isle, very little remains unchanged by our arrival. My training and experience has taught me that even the products of an environment like this one can be put to use. With so few resources, we must rely on our ingenuity to provide for us. I've been supplementing our stores with meat from the bears that wander this island. With the proper preparation, it can safely be eaten. If you're going to be out in the field, why not help replenish our stocks? "
3460,The Sun King's Command,Take the Sun King's Command to Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch. ,"This document looks to be important. Unfortunately, it is written in Thalassian, a language that you cannot understand. Perhaps Vindicator Boros will know what to do with the letter. "
3461,Don't Drink the Water,Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to use the Water Sample Flask to get a Bloodmyst Water Sample. ,Our shaman claim that the elements of water have become greatly agitated by the pollution of the water source. We know that the Exodar's power core is lodged into the mountain to the west. It must be leaking volatile fluids into the water supply! I need you to get me more information. <Aesom points to a flask and nods. >You are to take this flask and follow the beach north until you reach the area where the rivers of Bloodmyst drain into the ocean. Take a sample from that location and return to me. 
3462,Clearing the Way,Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest wants you to slay 8 Sunhawk Saboteurs and 8 Sunhawk Agents. ,"Only the most battle hardened, noble and positively fearless of draenei will submit to Legoso's mission. The exarch will not order any agent of the Hand to take on the task of destroying the Vector Coil and dispatching Sironas. He refuses to send any draenei to their death - which is what the mission is: suicide. . . <Corin sighs. >My job is to soften up the Sunhawk defenses. You are to slay Sunhawks near the Vector Coil and keep the path clear for our champion - whoever that may be. "
3463,The Missing Survey Team,Harbinger Mikolaas wants you to find the Survey Team he sent to the Ruins of Loreth'Aran and assist them in any way you can. ,"As we've gotten ourselves established here at Blood Watch, I've been sending out survey teams to create more reliable maps of the island. In most cases, they returned unharmed with the data we need, but the team I sent east to the ruins hasn't reported back. I worry about what might have happened to them, but I can't spare the men to send another mission after them. Find them, <name>, and lend them any assistance they require to return with their survey data. "
3464,Translations. . . ,Take the Sunhawk Missive to Interrogator Elysia at Blood Watch. ,"Our chief interrogator, Elysia, is fluent in Thalassian. Take the document to her and see what she has to say. "
3465,Into the Dream,Prince Toreth at Wyrmscar Island has asked that you slay 5 Viridian Whelps and 5 Viridian Broodlings. ,"The whelps that you see on this island are the agitated spirits of the green dragonflight. Like me, they are bound to the land, unable to ascend to their final resting place in the Dream. Recovering the bones of the fallen has settled them somewhat but you must take further action. Destroy their ethereal manifestations. I cannot leave this place until it is done. They must be released! "
3466,What We Don't Know. . . ,Speak to a Captured Sunhawk Agent at Blood Watch and recover Sunhawk Information. ,"Our attempts at interrogation have failed miserably, <name>. Torture is - of course - out of the question. What we need is a draenei on the inside. I can cast a spell upon you that would make you appear blood elf and adjust your language. Through subterfuge, we may be able to get the information we need out of the captured agent. Under this guise, I want you to get whatever information you can out of the prisoner. And <name>, do not leave Blood Watch while disguised as the spell will fail. "
3467,On the Wings of a Hippogryph,Purchase a hippogryph ride to the Exodar from Laando. ,"For a small fee, you can rent one of my hippogryphs to fly you to the Exodar. Taking the hippogryph is a faster, not to mention safer, alternative for someone carrying an important message. If you'd like to take a ride, speak to me again and I'll make the arrangements. "
3468,Constrictor Vines,Tracker Lyceon at Blood Watch wants you to bring him 6 Thorny Constrictor Vines. ,"A good woodsman makes use of every available resource, <class>. Even the most bizarre creatures possess attributes we can use to our advantage. With Blood Watch under constant assault from the Sunhawks, we're looking to a variety of natural defenses including traps. The lasher's thorny vines are perfectly suited to the construction of the traps I have in mind. The combination of sharp spines and deadly toxin will fell unwary attackers. Bring me the vines of mutated constrictors so that I can begin my work. "
3469,Restoring Sanctity,Prince Toreth on Wyrmscar Island wants you to recover 8 Dragon Bones. ,"Not long ago, the once tranquil owlkin of the region appeared on the shores of this island. One by one they would come to steal the bones of the fallen dragons. I do not know what would cause these creatures such distress or why they would want the bones of the deceased, but the spirits of the brood have grown restless due to this sacrilege. To the west, across the Crimson Reach, you will find Ragefeather Ridge. Venture to the owlkin encampments and recover the pilfered dragon bones. "
3470,Truth or Fiction,Take Velen's Orders to Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch. ,"I thank you for the timely delivery, <name>. You are turning out to be one of the Hand's better agents. If only we knew who they reported to in Bloodmyst and more importantly, where this sun portal was. . . They seem to have it tightly guarded - wherever it may be. Would you be interested in some reconnaissance work? If so, take these orders back to Vindicator Boros. He will give you your next mission. "
3471,Newfound Allies,Take the Letter of Introduction to Huntress Kella Nightbow in Azuremyst Isle. ,"Harbinger Mikolaas has done a commendable job of safeguarding Blood Watch, <class>, but our enemies are many and our resources few. Our weakness is well known to our enemies, but your contact with the forces of the Alliance is something they haven't accounted for. I have prepared a letter of introduction to the people of Auberdine, the closest Alliance settlement, proposing cooperation in the fight against our foes. Take it with you and seek out Huntress Kella Nightbow near the docks west of the Exodar. "
3472,More Irradiated Crystal Shards,"If you have more of the irradiated crystal shards, I'd be happy to exchange them for another of my crystals. ","Very well, here are the crystals that I have, <name>. Use them well. "
3473,Return to Topher Loaal,Speak with Stephanos to purchase a hippogryph ride back to Blood Watch. ,"If I remember correctly, Blood Watch's hippogryph master is Laando.  If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him. That's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there. Since you arrived on one of Laando's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to Blood Watch with the caregiver's supplies. "
3474,Searching for Galaen,Search for Morae's husband Galaen. ,"Do you think often of your family, <name>? There were a number of families aboard the Exodar, but I've heard of very few being reunited. I, myself, am looking for traces of my husband Galaen, who was a technician in the Cryo-Core. The wreckage of it is located to the west, and it's swarming with blood elves! I must find out what became of Galaen! Even news of his death is better than never knowing. My husband will be wearing a pendant identical to my own; they were a gift from my sister. "
3475,Report to Exarch Admetius,Speak with Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch. ,"A Hand of Argus soldier is many things: Obedient, brave, intelligent, and above all, honorable. You may yet exhibit some of these traits, <class>. Report to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch if you are still interested in joining the Hand. He and his subordinates will further train you in the ways of the draenei soldier. And remember this, <name>: Honorable people do not always perform honorably. Sometimes they cannot. You will find Blood Watch just up this road, to the north. "
3476,Artifacts of the Blacksilt,"Bring 3 Crude Murloc Idols and 6 Crude Murloc Knives to Clopper Wizbang, who is hiding in a beached turtle shell. ","My observations and writings about the Blacksilt murlocs are quite illuminating, <name>, but they are just the beginning. I plan to return to Ironforge with items produced by the Blacksilts' rudimentary crafting skills. The problem is that the Blacksilt carry these items with them at all times, and I can't have their blood on my conscience. If you're willing to help me gather the idols carried by Blacksilt seers and crude knives of the Blacksilt warriors and shorestrikers, I won't ask how you came by them. "
3477,Urgent Delivery,Are you &lt; name&gt; ? It's about time! I'd just about given up on finding you! There's an urgent message waiting for you at the mailbox. ,Are you <name>? It's about time! I'd just about given up on finding you! There's an urgent message waiting for you at the mailbox. The person that gave it to me was a human admiral from Azuremyst. Admiral Odesy-something. . . the name escapes me. He said you would know who he was. 
3478,Fouled Water Spirits,Kill 6 Fouled Water Spirits and return to Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest. ,"Most of the creatures touched by the crystals' energy have been corrupted in the same ways: strange marks on their flesh, increased aggression, and small crystal shards in their bodies. However, the fouled water spirits north of here appear to be turning entirely to crystal. I've never seen anything react to the crystals this way before, when we explored the foul pool, they were particularly dangerous. We must get rid of them before the Sunhawks can exploit them as a new source of energy. "
3479,Victims of Corruption,Bring 6 pieces of Crystallized Bark to Morae in Blood Watch. ,"Bloodmyst Isle was forever changed by our arrival. The Exodar's crash scattered debris all over the islands and I think it's beginning to have an adverse effect on the wildlife. Before I can be certain of my conclusion, I'll need to get a closer look. The crystals seem to have affected the trees the fastest, so it seems that the treants would be the most likely to show symptoms. If you bring me samples of bark from corrupted treants, I can begin my in-depth studies. "
3480,"Oh, the Tangled Webs They Weave",Kill 8 Mutated Tanglers and report to Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest. ,"We don't dare abandon our post, or wander too far from Vindicator's Rest, <race>. The mutated creatures closest to the Vector Coil have been changed profoundly by energy leaking from the crystals. The mutated tanglers appear to have gained a certain degree of sentience. They've learned to create, set, and conceal vicious traps that can ensnare even the most careful warrior. We'll never be able to move against the Sunhawks if we're constantly forced to look underfoot. Attack the problem at its source, <name>. "
3481,The Missing Expedition,"Kill 8 Myst Spinners, 8 Myst Leechers and their leader, Zarakh. ","About a week ago, my research team and I were out exploring the western wilds of Bloodmyst when we were attacked by bloodthirsty spiders. The effect of the crystal contamination was clearly evident as these spiders were massive and extremely aggressive. I managed to escape but my team wasn't so lucky. We must not let the same fate befall others. Go west to the Amberweb Pass and destroy the spiders and their matriarch, Zarakh. "
3482,A Favorite Treat,Aonar at Kessel's Crossing wants you to bring him 10 Sand Pears. ,"I've made a wonderful discovery, <class>. On the uncorrupted part of the island grows a remarkable fruit called the sand pear. They're found near the bottoms of the trees. I've been preparing pies from them, but if I'm not careful, the elekk will start to wander over and steal my fruit. I've taken to gathering enough to share with the animals, but my stores are gone and the craving for pie has returned. Would you be willing to help gather the fruit I need for another batch of pies? I promise I'll share! "
3483,Ysera's Tears,Maatparm at Blood Watch wants 2 Ysera's Tears. ,"Good to see you again, <name>! You were exceptionally efficient in completing the last task that I offered you. Perhaps you would be interested in another? To the northeast lies Wyrmscar Island, home to a rare species of mushroom known as Ysera's tear - named after the green dragonlings that inhabit the island. I only require a small sampling of the mushroom, but I must warn you that the denizens of the island do not welcome visitors. Tread carefully. "
3484,Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie,"Maatparm at Blood Watch wants 1 Aquatic Stinkhorn, 1 Blood Mushroom, 1 Ruinous Polyspore, and 1 Fel Cone Fungus. ","Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers! What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me. "
3485,What Argus Means to Me,Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch has told you to speak with Vindicator Boros. ,"What does Argus mean to you, <name>? Many draenei probably do not know or remember our home planet. It is there that we split from the man'ari: the twisted demonic reflections of ourselves that were 'gifted' by Sargeras. Or as they call themselves, eredar. Eredar. . . this word once held meaning. <Admetius smacks his lips as if to taste the word. >Disgusting. Let us not waste anymore time. Find Vindicator Boros to begin your training. "
3486,Galaen's Journal - The Fate of Vindicator Saruan,Take Galaen's Journal to Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch. ,Your hands tremble as you pick up the book. Kuros must be told about this tragedy. Return the book to him. 
3487,Vindicator's Rest,Speak with Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest on Bloodmyst Isle. ,"I would not ask you to single-handedly bear the burden of destroying the Vector Coil and slaying Sironas, <name>; however, I believe that you can be of some help in clearing the way for others that might take on such a dangerous assignment. Take the road going north out of Blood Watch and follow it until you get to the fork. Once there, take the left road and follow it until you see Vindicator's Rest - it will be slightly west of the road itself. Corin will be waiting for you. "
3488,Nolkai's Words,Find the location described in Nolkai's journal and discover his long-buried possessions. ,"The translation is ready now, <name>. < Anchorite Paetheus points out a block of text at the end of his translation. >'The enemy is nearly upon us. We've gathered up all the survivors and retreated to the temple to the east. It's the last ground we truly hold on the island, and there is a sense among the survivors that we will make our last stand here. I've taken care to bury my last few possessions on the grounds of the temple, with the hope that someone will find them and know what happened here. '"
3489,They're Alive! Maybe. . . ,Researcher Cornelius has asked that you free 5 Expedition Researchers. ,"It was a bloody mess, <name>. We were ambushed by a large pack of these spiders. Their progenitor descended upon us with incredible speed and wrapped us up in cocoons. After we were webbed, she began to lay eggs near us. We were to be food for her young! FOOD! I managed to cut my way out and escape but I will not leave the others behind. So far I've been unsuccessful in nearing the pass. Would you lend a hand? Destroy those cocoons! Hopefully some of our team is still alive! "
3490,Deciphering the Book,Take the Ancient Journal to Anchorite Paetheus in Blood Watch. ,"Lacking the means to read the book's contents, you think about who might be able to help you separate the author's words from the mapmaker's scrawl. Remembering Anchorite Paetheus 's collection of artifacts from countless cultures, you wonder if his experienced eye might be able to help you decipher the book's contents. "
3491,Containing the Threat,"Kill 5 Axxarien Shadowstalkers, 5 Axxarien Hellcallers, and Zevrax, then gather 5 Corrupted Crystals and return to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch. ","Now that we have made our presence known to the satyr, we must send a message that we will not tolerate the Burning Legion's hounds in these lands. Too long have the draenei fled in the wake of the Legion and its minions, <name>. Wherever they have found us, they have shown no mercy. We must not permit the satyr to exploit the Exodar's crash and use the corrupted crystals as weapons. Go north to where their leader resides in Axxarien, destroy him, and recover the corrupted crystals he has been gathering! "
3492,Hippogryph Master Stephanos,Find Stephanos outside the Exodar and purchase a hippogryph ride back to Blood Watch. ,"Here's the box, <name>. That should be enough for Topher to get the inn up and running. Let him know that he can keep sending in orders as the need arises. Blood Watch urgently needs a place to care for the wounded and put up any travelers they receive. When you're ready to return to Blood Watch, seek out Stephanos near the gates of the Exodar. "
3493,They're Alive! Maybe. . . ,Researcher Cornelius has asked that you free 5 Expedition Researchers. ,"It was a bloody mess, <name>. We were ambushed by a large pack of these spiders. Their progenitor descended upon us with incredible speed and wrapped us up in cocoons. After we were webbed, she began to lay eggs near us. We were to be food for her young! FOOD! I managed to cut my way out and escape but I will not leave the others behind. So far I've been unsuccessful in nearing the pass. Would you lend a hand? Destroy those cocoons! Hopefully some of our team is still alive! "
3494,The Bloodcurse Legacy,Admiral Odesyus has asked that you find and speak with Captain Edward Hanes. ,"Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship 'Lost Hope', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago. This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of Blood Watch? "
3496,Alien Predators,Kill 10 Bloodmyst Hatchlings then return to Vorkhan the Elekk Herder at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle. ,"One thing we've learned in our travels is that extreme care must be taken when introducing wildlife from one world to another. When the Exodar crashed, it was carrying specimens of various Outland species, including an insectoid predator called the ravager. Some of the specimens were lost, but many others survived and took to the wild. If we don't keep them in check, they will upset the natural balance here on the islands. You'll find these ravagers to the west of Kessel's Crossing, near the coast. "
3497,The Bloodcursed Naga,Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to kill 10 Bloodcursed Naga. ,"They say when the world was sundered, this land cried the loudest. It was here that thousands of night elves faded into oblivion and in their place rose terrible creatures of hate - the naga. Obedient to their twisted queen, Azshara, they would destroy all that would dare pass through their sea. It would remain this way for thousands of years - until now. The first order of business is to remove the bloodcursed naga from the reef. "
3498,The Second Sample,Get an Altered Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Altered Bloodmyst Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,"Now that we have the baseline crystal, we're going to need samples from more dangerous areas of the island to complete the set I'll be sending to the Exodar. The next sample must come from the crystals controlled by the blood elves in the Bladewood area to the northwest of Blood Watch. I have heard reports that they alter and harvest the crystals for use in some magical apparatus. See if you can find one that has not yet been incorporated into one of their devices, and mine a sample from it. "
3499,Talk to the Hand,Report to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest. ,"The Hand of Argus has established a forward base at Vindicator's Rest, but they are sorely outnumbered by both the blood elves and mutated wildlife. Without backup, their outpost is in danger of falling, and we'd have no way to keep an eye on events near the Vector Coil. Report to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest to the northwest and offer her your assistance, <name>. "
3500,"Beds, Bandages, and Beyond","Take Topher's List to Laando, the Hippogryph Master at Blood Watch. ","Welcome to Blood Watch, <class>. Please excuse the disorder you see around you. It's easy to take simple things for granted, like a fully furnished and stocked inn, until you're forced to build one from nothing. We've managed to salvage this pod for a building, but without the proper furnishings and first aid supplies, the inn is little more than a glorified tent. Nurguni at the Exodar has offered to put together a package to help with our most immediate needs, but I need someone to deliver this list to him. "
3501,Cutting a Path,Kill 10 Enraged Ravagers and return to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest. ,"During our mission to reconnoiter the Sunhawks and their portal, I sustained a serious wound. Scout Loryi has managed to staunch the bleeding and she's trying to figure out a way to evacuate me to Blood Watch. The problem is that we'd have to abandon our position here in order to guarantee a safe return. As soon as we leave this consecrated ground, we'll be set upon by ravagers. If you can clear some of the enraged ravagers, it might allow us to make the trip back safely. "
3502,On the Offensive,"Vindicator Aalesia at Blood Watch wants you to kill 10 Nazzivus Satyr, 5 Nazzivus Rogues, and 5 Nazzivus Felsworn. ","It's worse than I had imagined, <name>. We draenei know well what comes of selling one's soul to the Burning Legion in return for promises of power and immortality. The satyr on this island, the Nazzivus, are descendents of that first, twisted creature who allied with the Legion. I fear that they will find a way to use the power of the Exodar's crystals against us. You've seen what they've done to the land. Imagine what the satyr could do with them. Go southwest to Nazzivian and begin our offensive! "
3503,The Powers Below,"Bring the Book: The Powers Below to Gerrig Bonegrip in the Forlorn Cavern, Ironforge. ","Although terribly worn and scratched, the title of this book can still be read upon its cover: The Powers BelowInside the book is a listing of unpronounceable names with foreboding titles, methods of worship, and preferred sacrifices. . . many of which include living, humanoid creatures. On the inside cover of the book are the words: ""Bonegrip's Runes and Dooms, The Forlorn Cavern, Ironforge.  Proprietor: Gerrig Bonegrip. ""If Bonegrip sells books like this, perhaps he'll buy this one back. "
3504,The Sleeper Has Awakened,Escort Kerlonian Evershade to Liladris Moonriver at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale. ,"I was on my way to Maestra's Post to meet Liladris Moonriver, but I decided to stop here and take a short nap. Ever since I awoke from the emerald dream, I have been so sleepy. . . <yawn>Would you mind showing me the way? I understand that Maestra's Post is south of here, along the road in Ashenvale. It can be dangerous, so I hope you have some friends that will join us. Lastly, I may fall asleep so if you ever need to wake me, please use my horn. You'll find it in the chest here. "
3505,For Love Eternal,Free the spirit of Anaya Dawnrunner and bring her pendant back to Cerellean Whiteclaw in Auberdine. ,"In the aftermath of the battles at the Well of Eternity, I heard that Ameth'Aran had been destroyed, its people dead, including my love, Anaya. I would never have thought, thousands of years later, that memories of Anaya would still haunt my dreams. Wandering the woods of Darkshore in a stupor, I found myself in the ruins of Ameth'Aran. . . where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved. She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed. "
3506,The Tower of Althalaxx,Collect a Glowing Soul Gem and return it to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post. ,"Balthule's letter is dire. This Cult of the Dark Strand is a thorn in my side that must be removed. I have been dealing with some of the Dark Strand scum northeast of here at Ordil'Aran. One of their number possesses a soul gem that I believe holds the secret to the cult's power. Bring it to me, and I will be able to decipher the secrets held within. "
3507,The Blackwood Corrupted,Fill the Empty Cleansing Bowl at the Auberdine Moonwell. ,"We've learned that a source of furbolg corruption is from the satyr.  They hold sway via talismans that they channel magic through.  If the furbolg have a chance at salvation, we must lure out the satyr corruptor and take that talisman! Fill this bowl at our moonwell and take samples of the furbolgs' food from their northern camp.  Mix them and place it near the bonfire by the river; any furbolgs who eat will be cleansed just long enough to lure out the satyr corruptor. . . who then you must slay! "
3508,The Cliffspring River,Travel north of Auberdine to the first waterfall along the Cliffspring River and draw a sample from the pool there. ,"The Cliffspring River has begun turning foul and corrupted.  It empties into the Mist's Edge, and I fear the wash will affect Auberdine soon.  I suspect the Blackwood furbolgs up-river are the cause of the taint, but I also suspect that they aren't the true root of it. Take this sampling tube and go to the mouth of the river to our north.  Proceed inland to the first waterfall and draw a sample from the pool there.  You'll see a bridge overhead.  Once you have a sample, return to me in Auberdine. "
3509,Plagued Lands,Capture a living Rabid Thistle Bear and bring it back to Tharnariun. ,"A sickness spreads across the Darkshore, gripping the minds and bodies of all it touches. The Thistle Bears have been hit the hardest by this plague. The once noble beasts are now an instrument of destruction - rabid and frenzied. I may have a cure for this ailment.

3511,The Master's Glaive,"Gather information, then use the Phial of Scrying to create a Scrying Bowl. ","It is strange that the naga are here, in Darkshore.  But stranger still. . . are the Twilight's Hammer.  That cult worships the old, old lords of the earth.  Lords defeated long ago. The Master's Glaive, to the south, is a place where such an old lord fell. Go there and look for more Twilight's Hammer cultists. Take this phial of scrying.

Reward claims for this bounty should be claimed with Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine. The Auberdine Village Council"

It is heavily cursed and tainted by the corruption of the Twilight's Hammer, but it seems the cult is using ancient elven magic to bring their old masters back to our world. Travel to the ruins of Mathystra to the northeast, and search for ancient relics among the grass and broken stones.  Through their study, we may divine how the Twilight's Hammer intends to exploit the magic of the elves. "

If what he has told me is true, you will find his master in a cave south of here. Grimclaw will be alongside the road waiting for you. Signal to him by waving when you see him, and he'll point the way towards his master. "
3515,The Tower of Althalaxx,Talk to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post. ,"For all the work that you have done, you deserve to be well rewarded. Return to Delgren and tell him that Athrikus Narassin lies stilled by your hand, and the Cult of the Dark Strand is beaten and scattered. "

3517,The Tower of Althalaxx,"Free the trapped Highborne souls in Night Run and Satyrnaar, then return to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post. ","The writing of the orcs is little better than the scribblings of a child. Many of my order scoffed when I chose to learn their tongue, but I have found it beneficial to gain further understanding of my enemies. From Ilkrud's scribblings, it appears that Athrikus still possesses two soulgems, and they are being held in Night Run and Satyrnaar, satyr-held areas in northeast Ashenvale. Be careful out there, <name>, the satyrs' blood-soaked temples can be unsettling even for a seasoned <class> such as yourself. "

The cave lies behind Cliffspring Falls, to the east and slightly north along the mountains. I would go there myself, but I was advised by the Grove of the Ancients to stay away from that place.  Our venerable allies sense that the cave is the hiding place for a new evil in Darkshore. Please, <name>, gather the mushrooms for me.  And while doing so, scout the cave to confirm the Ancients' fears. "
3520,Bashal'Aran,"Destroy the Ancient Moonstone Seal at the ancient flame in Ameth'Aran, then return to Asterion in Bashal'Aran. ","It was the craft of one of the most powerful of the Highborne that created the seal that formed my prison.

To this end, I sent Balthule Shadowstrike to observe the strange happenings around the Tower of Althalaxx to the northeast. It is past time that he should have returned.

3522,The Tower of Althalaxx,Bring Ilkrud Magthrull's Tome to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post. ,"Ilkrud Magthrull. Yes, I have knowledge of him. He is a powerful orc warlock that makes his residence at the Fire Scar Shrine,  a place of great evil in southwestern Ashenvale.

We shall find something in writing to satisfy the League. So are you ready yet? "
3524,The Tower of Althalaxx,Speak with Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx. ,"Before confronting Athrikus, it would probably be wise for you to consult with Balthule. I have no doubt he has been vigilant in his watch of the Tower, and he may have information about recent developments. "
3525,"Deep Ocean, Vast Sea",Recover the Silver Dawning's Lockbox and the Mist Veil's Lockbox for Gorbold Steelhand in Auberdine. ,"Off the coast of Darkshore to our north are two wrecked ships - the Silver Dawning and the Mist Veil.  Some time ago, both ships ran afoul of the blasted murlocs as they sailed across the vast sea into Auberdine.  They now lie at the bottom of the ocean as trophies for those fiends.

3526,The Tower of Althalaxx,Kill Athrikus Narassin and bring his head to Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx. ,"I see. Well, if what you say is true, then now is the time to strike.

You have spilled the blood of nature's servants; many sick animals you have felled. The people of Auberdine are indebted to you, for the forest's pain is eased - even if only for a moment.

3530,Thundris Windweaver,Speak with Thundris Windweaver in Auberdine. ,"Your scouting of the furbolg camp is information that Thundris Windweaver should be made aware of.  He graciously serves as the elder of Auberdine, offering sage and just stewardship of the day to day affairs of the village.  Please - share with him your findings to date on the furbolg situation.

3532,The Absent Minded Prospector,Archaeologist Flagongut in Menethil Harbor wants you to bring him the Stone of Relu and Flagongut's Fossil. ,"Prospector Whelgar now holds the original fossil at his site in the Wetlands. When I discovered the Stone of Relu, I believed it to be the key to unlocking the mystery of the fossil. While I traveled on the road to meet Whelgar, I was attacked by raptors and the relic was lost. I don't know which one of the mottled beasts swallowed the relic but if you can retrieve it, I can unleash the power of these artifacts. Bring me both the Stone of Relu, and the original fossil he holds. "
3533,A Lost Master,Find 5 Fine Moonstalker Pelts and return them to Terenthis in Auberdine. ,"<name>, your skills have already helped me in my endeavor. Could I impose on you again to help Grimclaw and his master Volcor? In addition, I can craft you a magical cloak that will allow you to walk unhindered by Darkshore 's creatures while you look for him. To create the cloak, I'll need five fine moonstalker pelts from a moonstalker sire or matriarch to have enough material. The cats can be found near Wildbend River to the south, or even farther south near Ashenvale. "
3534,The Fall of Ameth'Aran,"Study the tablets which tell of Ameth'Aran and of its fall, then return to Sentinel Tysha Moonblade in Darkshore. ","To the east you will find the ruins of Ameth'Aran. It is now inhabited by the restless spirits of the Highborne that once dwelt within its walls, but once it was a place where the servants of Azshara freely practiced their powerful magics. I was sent to explore the ruins and came across two large tablets, scrawled with the stories of Ameth'Aran and its fall. While I read the runes, I was accosted by the spirits, and fled. Please, if you can, venture to the ruins and decipher the tablets in my place. "
3535,The Family and the Fishing Pole,Catch 6 Darkshore Grouper for Gubber Blump in Auberdine. ,"I love fishing.  The Blump family is known for fishing.  My name is Gubber Blump; I fish. There's a kind of fish I like to catch around these parts called Darkshore grouper.  I used to go out on a boat to fish for grouper, but no boats have been going out since them mean ol' murlocs moved in.  I bet they been eating up all the grouper too. Say, you wanna help me catch Darkshore grouper?  I'd give you a bona fide Blump Family Fishing Pole if you did!  It's a real good pole to catch fish with. "
3536,The Twilight Camp,Find a clue in the Twilight's Hammer camp at the Master's Glaive. ,The Twilight's Hammer's purpose at the Master's Glaive is not known.  But it must be dark.

The grove lies to the south, nestled near the mountains. The Ancients are patient and wise, <name>.  But if Onu seeks your counsel concerning what you saw in the falls, then I fear it is urgent. "
3538,Fruit of the Sea,Collect 6 Fine Crab Chunks for Gubber Blump in Auberdine. ,"I love crab.  Crabs are the fruit of the sea!  You can bake it, barbecue it, boil it, and broil it.  They're pan fried, deep fried, and stir fried.  There's crab salad, crab soup, crab stew, pepper crab, lemon crab, whipper root crab, and Ironforge surprise crab.  That's. . . that's about it. I'm here fishing right now, so I can't get any fine crab chunks.  You can pick them out of reef crawlers and encrusted tide crawlers.  You can make a lot with it.  You can bake it, barbecue it, boil it. . . "
3539,As Water Cascades,"Fill the Empty Water Tube at the Auberdine moonwell, and then investigate the red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain wall. ","Use this empty vial and fill up on some moonwell water here in Auberdine.  Such potent magic should provide a clue as to the composition of the crystal.  To do that, you'll pour the liquid over the crystal; it should take care of the rest. While I don't anticipate anything bad happening to you, I still want you to be careful.  Above us to the east is Felwood; if that crystal is tied to that place as I suspect it is, then it could prove to be very dangerous. "
3540,The Absent Minded Prospector,Travel south and check on Prospector Remtravel. ,What an honor it was when Master Greywhisker assigned me to work under the guidance of the great Prospector Remtravel. At the academy in Ironforge everyone knew of Remtravel's great discoveries. But the prospector is rather. . . um. . . oblivious. . . to his surroundings. We had uncovered evidence of a great society. Horrible golems sprang forth from the ground and overran the site. Remtravel never seemed to notice. I ran back to Auberdine for help. Please travel south and see if the prospector is okay! 
3541,The Absent Minded Prospector,Take the mysterious fossil to Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker in Darnassus. ,"So the prospector wants to send the mysterious fossil to the Explorers' League in Darnassus?

3542,The Red Crystal,"Travel east of Auberdine and look for a large, red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain range. ","Hostile moonkin roam in ever increasing numbers to our east.  They once were thought to be gentle, almost mystical creatures.  While some continue to hold reverence for them, the safety of Auberdine forces me to keep a more realistic view. I've received reports that moonkin are being drawn to a large red crystal along Darkshore 's eastern mountain range.  No one has any idea what that crystal is, or even if it really exists.  I want you to locate it over there and report back to me what you find. "
3543,The Absent Minded Prospector,Take the mysterious fossil to Archaeologist Flagongut in Menethil Harbor. ,"This fossil bears a striking resemblance to one I once saw in Ironforge. An archaeologist by the name of Flagongut brought it to our annual Explorers' League conference. He believed the fossil had a power which could be unlocked somehow. Last I heard Flagongut had holed up in the Deepwater Tavern in Menethil Harbor, awaiting escort to the Whelgar Excavation Site. Seek him out and show him Remtravel's fossil. Perhaps he can reveal the secrets of the past. Good luck findin' your way there! "
3544,Cleansing of the Infected,Cleanse the forest of 20 Rabid Thistle Bears and return to Tharnariun Treetender in Darkshore. ,"As I had feared, the cure does not work. It saddens me greatly to order the death of any of nature's beasts, but the sick and tainted thistle bears must be put down. Return to the forest and destroy 20 rabid thistle bears, <name>.

I have seen a couple hints of corruption in Darkshore already, but I have yet to find any widespread signs. I think it would be logical if the investigation continued with the furbolgs. Would you find one of their camps, and return to me if you see any signs of corruption? "
3547,Tools of the Highborne,Retrieve 7 Highborne Relics for Thundris Windweaver in Auberdine. ,"<class>. A task I would ask of you. Have you seen the ruins of Ameth'Aran? If not, you will find them on the eastern side of the main road, some ways to the south. Once they were the home of many powerful Highborne, now they are a testament to the destruction their dabblings produced. I have been told by the Sentinels that the spirits of the Highborne persist, and that they wield their ancient magical implements. Those relics must be appropriated, so that we might destroy them. "
3548,Buzzbox 827,Collect 6 Crawler Legs and place them in Buzzbox 827. ,"Hey! Help me with my latest invention, the buzzbox. You can talk to people far away! Maybe you've already seen them, they're boxes with levers on them. The only problem is they need constant maintenance. Each one suffers from a different problem, but I made a really smart decision. I placed each one near creatures that have the proper parts to fix that particular machine. Right now Buzzbox 827 is on the fritz. It's just south of Auberdine, real close. It takes 6 Crawler Legs to fix it. I'll pay ya. . . "
3549,The Tower of Althalaxx,Collect 4 Worn Parchments for Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx. ,"A group of warlocks has taken up residence around and inside the tower. I would have returned to Auberdine to report to Elissa earlier, but I was afraid that I might miss something while I was away. Delgren suspected such a company might be gathering at the tower, but did not know why. A few scraps of parchment that the warlocks carry have found their way to my hands, but I need more to complete the puzzle. I warn you not to venture into the tower, however, the warlocks there are much more powerful! "
3550,Washed Ashore,"Recover Sea Creature Bones from the beached sea creature just south of Auberdine, and then return with it to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ","Majestic sea creatures are known to launch themselves at the Darkshore coastline, beached there until they die. Lately, these beasts have been washing ashore in ever-increasing numbers.  I've been sent here by the Temple of the Moon to investigate, but the presence of murlocs along the water has made my research difficult. There is a giant creature washed ashore just south of Auberdine that is ringed by the foul Greymist murlocs.  Could you go there and retrieve bones from the creature for our study? "

3554,Beached Sea Turtle,Take the Sea Turtle Remains to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"You find a corpse of a sea turtle that had beached itself on the coast of Darkshore some time ago.

3555,One Shot. One Kill. ,"Protect Sentinel Aynasha, then speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale. ","I was traveling to Auberdine with an important message when I was attacked by the furbolg Marosh and his trackers. During the attack I was poisoned, leaving me barely able to stand. I can make an antidote, but it will take time before it is ready. I would ask that you defend me until I can apply the antidote. I will aid you with my bow as best I can. Should we survive, I will be able to deliver my message to Auberdine, while you speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post to inform her of this incident. "

Terenthis will want to hear your version of the story immediately, so head to Auberdine after we make it out of here. "
3558,Beached Sea Creature,Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"The remains of a giant thresher - much larger than one you'd expect to find in Darkshore - lie beached on the coast of the Mist's Edge.  How this creature came to be here is unknown; the group of murlocs that now feast off the carcass of it seem to be much too weak, even in large numbers, to have brought down the beast. While some of it has been picked clean, enough of it remains to take a sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine to study. "
3559,Bashal'Aran,Acquire 8 Grell Earrings for Asterion in Bashal'Aran. ,"If I were to relate the story of my life, I have no doubt it would surpass the limits of your patience. Let us say that mine has been a long and painful life, and this spectral form is perhaps the worst torment of all. I am held here by the means of magic. Though my words may seem disingenuous, I assure you I would be grateful beyond words if you would help me find the means of my imprisonment. A seal binds me, and by examining the earpieces of the sprites and grells, I may find a trace of it. "
3560,The Fragments Within,Report back what you have found to Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine. ,"The moonwell water has revealed that embedded inside the crystal are a few small fragments of bone, as well as half of a jawbone.  The jawbone appears to be from a humanoid, but it is unclear without breaking open the crystal - a feat that even the strongest of magic would find near impossible. With the task at hand complete, all that remains is to report back to Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine. "
3561,Beached Sea Turtle,Take the Strangely Marked Box to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"More sea turtle remains lie beached along the coastline.  This particular set has an abandoned carriage attached to the turtle's shell.  Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested.  Greymist murlocs now make the remains of this creature their home, feasting off the carrion. In the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it; perhaps Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine can make sense of it. "
3562,Return to Nessa,Bring Laird's Response to Nessa Shadowsong. ,"I must send a response to Nessa.  She'll be very interested to know how different the fish here are from those along Teldrassil's coastline.  We can only guess the cause, but it is my suspicion that the world tree itself is affecting the wildlife around it! Please, take this response to Nessa.  If you wish to take a hippogryph back to Rut'theran then speak with the hippogryph master Caylais Moonfeather.  If you wish to take the ferry, then one regularly departs from the dock to the northwest. "

","From Rut'theran, there are two methods of travel to Auberdine: by ferry and by hippogryph.  Both are quick and reliable, but if you have not yet flown to Auberdine by hippogryph, then I suggest you do. It is sound advice to speak with the hippogryph master in every town that has one.  Once you speak to the master, you can then fly there from other towns. Here is Nessa's collection.  Speak with me again when you are ready to fly to Auberdine and deliver Nessa's collection to Laird.

Do you have what it takes to fight them as well? Not all adventurers prefer straightforward combat to the art of stealth and evasion. If you think you're up for the task, then the furbolg camp south of Auberdine is currently the biggest threat to our people. You'll find some of the Blackwood tribe there. Kill 8 pathfinders and 5 windtalkers, and return to me here. "
3566,Return to Onu,Bring Onu the recovered Insane Scribbles. ,"Peering into the Twilight Tome is maddening.  Text begins to swim and dance after only a moment's glance, and once beautiful scrollwork twists into grotesque shapes. Tearing away one page of insane scribbles is all that is possible before a swoon overtakes you. "
3567,Beached Sea Turtle,Take the Sea Turtle Remains to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"The skeletal remains of a sea turtle lie in the sand of the northern Darkshore beaches.  The Greymist murlocs have either not found this carcass, or perhaps they have and are shying away from it for some unknown reason.  Regardless, there is enough of the turtle left to take a sample back to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine for the Temple of the Moon to study. "
3568,Bashal'Aran,Find the source of the strange blue aura in the ruins of Bashal'Aran. ,"The ruins of Bashal'Aran to the east are overrun with demonic minions. The sprites and satyrs that have taken up residence in the area feed upon the magical energies of the area, their powers growing from continued exposure. Even with that, I have noticed that there is one shrine they will not approach. On the western side of the ruins, atop a small bluff, a strange blue aura permeates. . . There must be an explanation to the demons' reluctance. I would like you to investigate it. "
3569,The Bounty of Teldrassil,Bring Nessa's Collection to Vesprystus. ,"The fishermen of Rut'theran village do very well, for the fish here are extremely large and abundant.  I would like to compare the bounty here with that of the mainland. I have a collection of fish bones and scales that I would like taken to a colleague of mine in Darkshore.  His name is Laird, he is a fish vendor in the village of Auberdine. Bring my collection to our hippogryph master, Vesprystus, and speak to him about traveling to Auberdine. "
3570,Bashal'Aran,Obtain the Ancient Moonstone Seal and bring it to Asterion in Bashal'Aran. ,"If the grells have come into close contact with the seal that binds my eternal prison, I suspect I know the cause. No doubt the seal has come into the possession of the satyr that lead them. I feel strongly that this must be true, <name>. One of the satyr must surely possess it. If you can obtain it, you would bring me so close to passing the bars of my prison that tears would come to my eyes. "
3571,Beached Sea Creature,Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"The remains of what appear to be a giant thresher have washed ashore on the rocky inlet of the Twilight Shore.  The thresher is several times larger than any of the other threshers spotted in these parts.  Wherever it came from, this creature would not seem to have been native to Darkshore. Though the creature has been picked apart in places, enough of it remains to gather a suitable sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. "
3572,Beached Sea Turtle,Take the Strangely Marked Box to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"Another set of sea turtle remains lie beached on the coastline.  This set of remains has an abandoned carriage half buckled to the turtle's shell.  Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested.  Powerful Greymist murlocs have made the carcass of this creature their current home. In the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it; perhaps Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine can make sense of it. "
3573,Beached Sea Creature,Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"The half-devoured corpse of what might have been a giant sea mammal lies on the beach.  A band of murlocs, stronger than those found closer to Auberdine, have taken up residence around the fallen creature.  Enough of the creature remains that a suitable sample of its bones could be delivered to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. "
3574,Beached Sea Creature,Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. ,"The corpse of what appears to be some sort of giant sea mammal lies partially gutted on the beach.  A wheelbarrow and various tools lie abandoned by this enormous beached sea creature, as though an attempt to study it had been made previously.  Though murlocs have scavenged this beast, enough of it remains to gather a suitable sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine. "

Graceful and pure, the spider spun her silver threads through the moonlight, catching the evening mist. The silvery dew had strong healing powers and was kept here in the temple. But of late, Sathrah has descended into madness. Her future generations are now threatened as well. Find Lady Sathrah, <name>, and end her suffering. She dwells along the northern borders of Teldrassil, near Wellspring Lake. Gather her silvery spinnerets and bring them back to me. "
3577,The Mystery of Morrowgrain,Bring 10 Morrowgrain to Quintis Jonespyre in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"Let me to be frank with you, <name>.  I'm interested - nay, concerned with why the Arch Druid in Darnassus is using the name of the Cenarion Circle as well as the Circle's resources to procure vast amounts of morrowgrain.  I'm a researcher - curses are my specialty.  I've heard that morrowgrain, under the right conditions, exude qualities like other herbs used in primitive curses. I want to know more, and I ask for your help.  Bring me ten morrowgrain, and I will be sure to take care of you. "
3578,A Cautious Return,Bring Daros' Journal to Mordent Evenshade in Darnassus. ,"A moment of your time, <class>. Change is coming. It has drawn us out of the ruins of Eldre'Thalas and into the wide world once more. I have come to research this city and cannot stray from it, but if you are inclined, I have an errand for you. My colleague set out for Darnassus to speak with the High Priestess there, that we might come to an understanding. Take this journal to Mordent Evenshade in the temple. It may help in his diplomacy mission. "
3579,Morrowgrain Research,Use an Evergreen Pouch with a Packet of Tharlendis Seeds and two Un'Goro Soil samples to try and cultivate samples of Morrowgrain. ,"Here's your Evergreen Pouch that you'll need to use the Tharlendis seeds with.  You also need to have Un'Goro soil samples on hand to use as fertilizer for the seeds.  Just use the pouch when you have everything; the pouch will take care of the rest. When you have enough morrowgrain, bring them here to me in the enclave.  Please don't bother the Arch Druid; he's a very busy man, and he doesn't need to be disturbed every time someone returns with another batch of morrowgrain! "
3580,Un'Goro Soil,Bring 20 Un'Goro Soil samples to Jenal at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus. ,"The soil of Un'Goro Crater is reportedly enriched with potent magical qualities.  I want to know facts from falsehoods; go into the wilds of Un'Goro and acquire enough quality samples of soil for our continued study. You may think that collection tasks are beneath you; that sort of attitude does not endear yourself to me or the Cenarion Circle.  Bring the samples to Jenal, who is no doubt wasting time outside behind this tree; just look for the piles of dirt.  He will handle the logistics - not I. "
3581,Nessa Shadowsong,Speak with Nessa Shadowsong. ,"A friend of mine, Nessa Shadowsong, is a fishing merchant in Rut'theran Village.  She needs a parcel taken to Darkshore, and is looking for someone to help her. If you're interested, then to reach Nessa you must take the portal in Darnassus to Rut'theran Village.  You will find the portal west of the Temple Gardens. "
3582,Grove of the Ancients,"Deliver Fandral's message to Onu in the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore, south of Auberdine. ","If you had enough time to run messages for the Oracle Tree, then I'm sure that I can press you into service to deliver a message to the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore, due south of Auberdine. You will most likely have to secure transport on a hippogryph, but I have faith enough in you that you can manage that. Take this to Onu, the Ancient of Lore. He has been awaiting word from me, even as I waited for news from the Oracle Glade. "
3583,A Donation of Wool,We are currently accepting donations for wool cloth. ,"Wonderful!  We thank you for your generous donation, <name>! "
3584,March of the Silithid,Speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg in Gadgetzan. ,"It would seem that the silithid's intent, nay - reason for being, is to devour everything in their path that is not of their ecology.  Their focus is singular, and it is for this reason they are a grave threat to all life on Azeroth. What we've seen to date is but the first stages.  I suspect that their strength comes from deeper in Kalimdor: Un'Goro Crater.  Go to Gadgetzan in the Tanaris desert and speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg.  Tell him of my theory; he will surely aid us in fighting the silithid. "
3585,Sathrah's Sacrifice,"Priestess A'moora wants you to place Lady Sathrah's silvery spinnerets at the fountain inside the temple, and then return to her. ","Now you must finish the task to which you have been appointed. Take the spinnerets and offer Lady Sathrah's sacrifice to Elune; lay the great spider to rest. Inside this temple, find the central fountain. There is where you may leave the sacrifice.  The holy waters will purify and cleanse the corruption that drove Sathrah mad. When you have completed this, return to me. "

","For this task, Keeper Remulos' majordomo in Moonglade - Rabine Saturna - seeks aid in exploring the vast wastelands far to the west of Tanaris. . . and even further west of Un'Goro.  You should find him in Nighthaven, the main village of Moonglade. While your work will no doubt be of tremendous benefit to us all, I advise you to tread gingerly.  There are tensions between Darnassus and Moonglade. . . ones that may grow over the course of time. "
3587,Morrowgrain Research,Take the Arch Druid's Seed Voucher to Mathrengyl Bearwalker in the Cenarion Enclave of Darnassus. ,"With what we call an Evergreen Pouch, we have cultivated Tharlendris seeds in the soil from Un'Goro Crater.  These seeds blossom into an array of random, potent herbs.  One result is morrowgrain, a mysterious herb we know little about; I intend to unravel this mystery. Take this to Mathrengyl downstairs, and he will give you some seeds so you can get started.  If you run out, you will need to purchase more from him. "
3588,The Temple of the Moon,Sister Aquinne wants you to speak with Priestess A'moora in the Temple of the Moon. ,"A once great creature of the forest is in need of help, <race>. There is a difficult task that must be done. Please seek out Priestess A'moora; she will explain things to you. Find her to the southeast of here, inside the Temple of the Moon. "
3589,Morrowgrain to Feathermoon Stronghold,"Hello again, &lt; name&gt; . ","Thanks <name>; I'll just store these out of the way for the time being.  While I don't command the resources that Staghelm does, I am able to give you a little something for your trouble.  Anyway, who knows what will happen if Staghelm keeps getting Morrowgrain after Morrowgrain.  There's something fishy going on, mark my words. Remember that I'm always looking for more Morrowgrain.  I'll take them in quantities of five at a time. "

3592,Calm Before the Storm,Bring the Bank Voucher to Idriana in the bank of Darnassus. ,"<name>, your help has been immeasurable.  The time will come, no doubt, when I'll ask for your assistance against the silithid once more.  We must absorb what we have learned in Un'Goro; I fear that my assumptions that the silithid originated from Un'Goro are now wrong. . . that indeed there is a far stronger presence somewhere. Take this note to Idriana at the bank.  She'll give you something from my vault that should be viewed as a token of my gratitude.  Thank you for your assistance, brave <class>. "
3593,Trouble In Darkshore? ,Travel to Auberdine and look for signs of the dwarven excavation team. ,"How nice it is to see a <class> interested in the great archeological wonders of our world. Oftentimes our work is dismissed as mere hobby by our friends in the Alliance. But what many fail to realize is that recent discoveries in Khaz Modan have proven that a great and powerful force threatens all of Azeroth, from Lordaeron to Kalimdor. I am most worried about my crew that I sent to Darkshore. They haven't sent word in weeks. Travel to Auberdine and look for a clue as to their whereabouts. "

A colleague of mine would like to speak with you about the research you are doing in conjunction with the Cenarion Circle.

He would like to confer with you about morrowgrain. . . and he very much would like for you to keep our discussion from the ears of the Arch Druid. If you're interested, speak with him; no doubt, all will be revealed once you do. "

The Cenarion Circle in Darnassus is looking for seasoned adventurers such as yourself to lend them aid in a vital research project.

3599,The New Frontier,Speak with Mathrengyl Bearwalker at the Cenarion Enclave of Darnassus. ,"I have relegated my second, Mathrengyl Bearwalker, to deal with Moonglade's call for aid.  Speak to him on this matter - NOT me. Let me give you some. . . friendly. . . advice.  It is I who led us out of the darkness - NOT the Cenarion Circle in Moonglade - when all was lost for our race.  Teldrassil gives us all new life!  They would have you believe otherwise, and to believe their propaganda would be a fool's task. I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not you're a fool. "
3600,Additional Runecloth,"Greetings once again, &lt; name&gt; ! &nbsp; Our need for runecloth is constant, and we can always use additional resources if you are willing to part with them.

This is for you, <name>.  The Cenarion Circle thanks you for your continued support. "
3603,Brother Anton,Speak with Brother Anton at Nijel's Point in Desolace. ,"My brother in arms, Brother Anton, heard rumors of an undead infestation in distant Kalimdor, in a land known as Desolace.  Anton immediately booked passage to that place, to seek and destroy the undead menace! He is looking for those with the bravery and resolve to aid him.  If your heart is true, then speak with Anton.  He is in Desolace, in the Alliance town of Nijel's Point. "
3604,Gelkis Alliance,"Gain a Friendly reputation with the Gelkis, then speak with Uthek the Wise. ","To beat the centaur, we must use their hatred against them.  We will ally with one of the clans and through them, we will learn how to defeat all the clans. If you choose to ally with the Gelkis then slay their most hated rival, the Magram.  After you earn the respect of the Gelkis, meet with the Gelkis shaman Uthek the Wise, on the outskirts of the Gelkis Village, in southwest Desolace. "
3605,Magram Alliance,"Gain a Friendly reputation with the Magram, then speak with Warug. ","To beat the centaur, we must use their hatred against them.  We will ally with one of the clans and through them, we will learn how to defeat all the clans. If you choose to ally with the Magram then slay their foes, the Gelkis.

3606,Catch of the Day,"Talk to Jinar'Zillen at Shadowprey Village, and then bring Nataka Longhorn 2 Bloodbelly fish. ","The smell of cooked fish has long been missing here at Ghost Walker Post. The trolls at Shadowprey Village are the best at catching fish. . . but alas, with all the centaur activities I have little time to make a journey to the trolls. Hrm. . . Do me a favor and journey to Shadowprey Village. Talk to the local fisherman Jinar'Zillen and bring me back my favorite, Bloodbelly fish. The road south of here will take you west to the troll village. "
3607,The Corrupter,Slay Lord Azrethoc and Jugkar Grim'rod and return to Takata Steelblade in Desolace. ,"Although I have no knowledge of this Lord Azrethoc, I agree with Maurin, he must be stopped; especially if he is attempting to gain influence over the Burning Blade to further his goals. You have already shown you wish to aid the Warchief, and I would trust you to gather a party to slay the demon lord and his warlock servant. When you are ready, head directly south,  and return to me when the threat has been ended. "
3608,Bodyguard for Hire,Escort the Gizelton Caravan past the Kolkar Centaur village. ,"Under normal circumstances, Rigger and I would lead our kodo past the Kolkar Centaur. Every now and then we hear the Centaur war drums, and when we hear those we stop. It's not good for business to be dead! I'll tell you what <class>, if you protect us past the Kolkar village we'll make it worth your while. It's just a short distance, all you need to do is keep the caravan intact and you can pick up your reward from Smeed Scrabblescrew - he is down the road a bit. We do a little business together. "
3609,Stealing Supplies,Bring 6 bags of Crudely Dried Meat to Uthek the Wise in the Gelkis Village. ,"When we are not at war, we hunt for meat.  Meat gives us strength, and full bellies fight harder than empty ones. It is the same with the Magram.  They store extra meat so they may fight longer between hunts.  If you raid their village to the east and take their stores of meat, then their strength will fail. "
3610,Claim Rackmore's Treasure! ,Find Rackmore's Silver Key. ,"Rackmore's log tells of how his ship was sailing for Feathermoon Stronghold when it was attacked by seafaring creatures.  To prevent his treasure from falling into enemy hands, he hid his chest on Ranazjar Isle. To open the chest requires two keys, a silver and a gold.

Khan Hratha holds the piece of. . . a key.  Bring it to me. . . "
3612,Strange Alliance,"Gain a Friendly reputation with the Gelkis, then speak with Uthek the Wise. ","We are fortunate the centaur clans fight among themselves, for if they joined into a single force then they would be unstoppable.  Yes, we are fortunate, and we should press our advantage. One of the centaur clans, the Gelkis clan, is in brutal war with the Magram clan.  If we attack the Magram, then perhaps an alliance may be struck with the Gelkis. Speak with Uthek the Wise, in the outskirts of the Gelkis camps in southwestern Desolace.  Through her we might strike an alliance with the Gelkis. "
3613,The Corrupter,Bring the Flayed Demon Skin to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace. ,"The torn skin smells rotten, and is remarkably pliable for something that appears to be dry and fragile. As you unroll it, you can clearly see the red markings of some kind of language on one side. At the bottom of the skin is a very clear symbol that you guess is a signature of some kind. Perhaps it is something Maurin could tell you more about? "
3614,Brutal Politics,"Gain a Friendly reputation with the Magram, then speak with Warug. ","Desolace is a land at war.  The centaurs wage war with each other, and we believe the victor among them will spill out and threaten our strongholds.  That, we cannot allowWe must learn how to beat the centaurs, and to do that. . . we must ally with one of the clans.  The Magram centaurs war with the Gelkis.

3615,Broken Tears,"Maintain your reputation with the Magram, and bring 3 Broken Tears to Warug in the Magram Village. ","The Gelkis think our centaur mother, Theradras, protects us.  They are stupid.  No one protects the centaur.  The Magram do not need protection!  We are the strongest! Show the Gelkis they are stupid.  Go to the cave in their village.  They hoard crystals in that cave, the tears of Theradras.  Destroy the tears and bring me the broken pieces! "
3616,Sceptre of Light,Get the Sceptre of Light and then return it to Azore Aldamort at the tower in Ethel Rethor. ,"The Burning Blade in Thunder Axe Fortress to the east is rumored to have acquired the Sceptre of Light from the Naga. Legend tells that the sceptre is able to sink entire cities under the great seas. The Burning Blade must not be allowed to possess such power. To that end, you must retrieve the sceptre yourself!  It is held by a Burning Blade seer, who studies the sceptre from atop one of the Thunder Axe watchtowers. "
3617,The Corrupter,Bring an Oracle Crystal to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace. ,"An oracle crystal would do nicely. They are crafted by the naga for their oracles to use. Northwest of here, along the coast, is a vast coral reef that the naga have taken as their home when this close to the shore. You can find their oracles there. The Slitherblade are deadly and will not react kindly to your intrusions, so be careful and make haste. When you return, we shall see about finding this demon lord Azrethoc. "

I came up to the Valley of Spears to talk to the Maraudines.  I thought I could do a little business with them. . . but they don't want to talk!  I think they want to eat me! Get me out of here and my brother Hornizz will pay you big!  He's at our camp next to the kodo graveyard, to the east. Let's hurry, <name>.  Not two minutes ago I heard some centaurs talking about getting wood for their cookpot. . . "
3619,Book of the Ancients,Get the Book of the Ancients and return it to Azore Aldamort at the tower in Ethel Rethor. ,"<name>, I entrust you with the Gem of the Serpent. Place this gem on the Serpent Statue's hand on Ranazjar Isle, a small island northwest of here. Placing it will summon the one who protects the Book of the Ancients. This book contains the secrets of the naga, secrets that have been kept for centuries.  Bring this book to me, and we will learn much about our scaled foes! "
3620,Down the Scarlet Path,"Destroy 30 Undead Ravagers, then return to Brother Anton at Nijel's Point. ","I will be frank.  We are at war with the Scourge.  It is an evil that corrupts our people and infects our land.  It must be stopped before it overwhelms us and drags our world into shadow.  We of the Scarlet Crusade have sworn to fight the Scourge with body and soul. If you are with us, then gather your courage and prove your allegiance--destroy the undead ravagers of Desolace, in the Valley of Bones to the south. Do this, and the Crusade will embrace you. "
3621,The Karnitol Shipwreck,Find Karnitol's Chest in Desolace. ,"My first order of business is for the mage Karnitol--a noble of some sort in Stormwind. Seems his ship was attacked by sea giants while off the coast in the northwest of Desolace. He and his servants tried to bring one of his more valuable chests ashore, but when the sea giants attacked in droves, he chose to abandon it and teleport himself and his servants to safety. He wants us to find the chest and its contents, and return it to him in Stormwind. "
3622,Hand of Iruxos,"Retrieve the Demon Box from Thunder Axe Fortress, and return it, along with the Demon Pick to Taiga Wisemane in Shadowprey Village. ","The Burning Blade possesses the Demon Box.

Use this demon pick on the red crystal in Thunder Axe Fortress to gain access to the Demon Box. "
3623,Gizmo for Warug,"Maintain your reputation with the Magram, and bring an Advanced Target Dummy to Warug in the Magram Village in Desolace. ","Long ago, a little gnome came to Desolace.  He had horses and a cart, and the cart held strange things.  Funny things.  Things that burned different colors.  Things that moved and weren't alive.  I killed the little gnome, but before that. . . he made me laugh. I kept my favorite thing from his cart.  It was a human made of wood and it waved at me until I hit it and broke it. I want a new one.  Get me a new one! "
3624,Kodo Roundup,Bring five Tamed Kodos and the Kodo Kombobulator back to Smeed Scrabblescrew at Scrabblescrew's Camp. ,"Bibbly thinks he is the only goblin in Desolace who knows how to make money.  Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me.  Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged and dying kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership. Take the kombobulator and use it on any ancient, aged, or dying kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me. "

Speak with Felgur Twocuts at Ghost Walker Post in Desolace.  He was sent to gather intelligence on the centaur.  He will know how to best deal with the Kolkar of Desolace. "

Along that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet. If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches. "

Sounds scary, doesn't it?  Well think how scary it is to the Magram!  If we captured ghost energy from that place, I bet it'd be worth plenty to those centaurs. Here, take this crate of ghost magnets.  If you place one between the two big skeletons in the valley, the Dead Goliaths, then ghosts will wander to it.

Leftwitch says he needs: ten brains from either mana eaters, mage hunters, or ley hunters. Ten nether wings from a nether maiden, sister or sorceress.

Swim through the wreckage, <name>, and retrieve for me the tools of the Alliance. "
3690,Vile Familiars,Kill 8 Vile Familiars. ,"I trust the Valley of Trials will teach you much, young <class>. I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here. . . A group that calls itself the Burning Blade has a coven here in the Valley of Trials.  They are skulking in a cave to the northeast, and their Vile Familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc. As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me. "
3691,Report to Sen'jin Village,Speak with Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village. ,"Your trials against the Burning Blade are finished. . . here in the Valley.  But I want you to report your findings. Go to the troll village of Sen'jin and seek out Master Gadrin.  Sen'jin Village is east out of the valley, then right at the fork. Tell Gadrin of the Burning Blade, and that they have reached the Valley of Trials.  Discover from him if they have yet reached Sen'jin. Go, <name>, and be swift.  I fear the evil found in the Burning Blade Coven is but the herald of a larger threat. . . "
3692,Securing the Lines,Kill 12 Dustwind Savages and 8 Dustwind Storm Witches for Rezlak near Drygulch Ravine. ,"Gazlowe told me once, "" Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself. ""I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Drygulch Ravine lies through the eastern part of Razorwind Canyon. If we kill all the harpies there, the routes will be safe. Of course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's ""You can get anything done for a price. "" So, going to help me out, <name>? "
3693,Winds in the Desert,Retrieve 5 Sacks of Supplies and return them to Rezlak near Orgrimmar. ,"I'm Rezlak, one of Gazlowe's boys. Boss sent me to help the orcs here in Durotar. Things'd been going good except for the caravans. Can't manage to keep them safe! Makes my job a little harder, you know? The last shipment--they promised it'd get through! --was snatched by the Dustwind harpies of. . . where was it. . . Razorwind Canyon? I gotta have those supplies or I'll never get anything done! Follow the big canyon to the south, you'll find the ravine cut right into the west and east sides of the walls. "
3694,Crossroads Conscription,Follow the western road from Kargal's Far Watch Outpost. ,"Take this signed recruitment letter to the Crossroads. Sergra Darkthorn, curse her hide, is in charge there. She's a nasty shaman who will talk your head in circles before she lets you do anything useful. Thrall is convinced she's something special, but I'm not so sure. You'll just have to decide for yourself, pup. . . "
3695,Minshina's Skull,Retrieve Minshina's skull from the circle of power on the Echo Isles. ,"I hear the voice of my brother, Minshina, calling to me in my dreams. He was taken by Zalazane, the warlock on the Echo Isles to the east. And he is dead. But death is not freedom for my brother. Minshina's spirit was trapped within his own skull by Zalazane's magics. In my dreams I see it with other skulls, in a circle of power on the largest Echo Isle. As long as it remains there my brother's soul is doomed. Please, <name>. Find the circle and retrieve Minshina's skull. Bring it to me. Free him! "
3696,Galgar's Cactus Apple Surprise,Bring Galgar 6 Cactus Apples. ,"It sure gets hot out here in the Valley of Trials. < Galgar wipes his brow. >If only I had some cactus apples, I could make my famous cactus apple surprise! Nothing cools you off faster than a piece of that delicious treat. I'll tell you what, <name>. If you bring me 6 cactus apples, I'll make you a few portions of cactus apple surprise to take with you on your adventures. If you're interested, you can find cactus apples growing near the cactus plants around here. "
3697,Ak'Zeloth,Speak with Ak'Zeloth in the Barrens. ,"Since the last great war when the Burning Legion was defeated, I have searched for sources of demonic corruption in orc society.  The collar you brought me confirms my fears. It belongs to the Burning Blade, a cult that rallies around an item of demonic power.  It is called the Demon Seed, and it resides in the Barrens atop Dreadmist Peak.  It must be destroyed! Go to Far Watch Post, on the border of the Barrens to the west, and speak with my assistant, Ak'Zeloth.  He will direct you further. "
3698,Your Place In The World,Speak with Gornek. ,"Finally, you are of age, <name>. . . of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief. Yes. . . < Kaltunk looks you over. >You will do nicely. No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less. . . dangerous. < Kaltunk laughs. >Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young <class>. You will find Gornek in the Den, to the west. "
3699,Neeru Fireblade,Bring an Example Collar to Neeru Fireblade in Orgrimmar. ,"The Searing Collars you brought me are powerful, demonic implements.  Divining their origin is, I'm afraid, beyond my skills as a shaman.  We will need a warlock to study them. Take a searing collar to Neeru Fireblade.  Although he is a skilled warlock, he professes to use his powers to thwart demons, and claims his research in the occult is benign.  Be that true or false, we may need his aid against the demonic cult in Durotar. You may find Neeru in Orgrimmar in the Cleft of Shadow. "
3700,Sarkoth,Bring the news of Hana'zua's plight to Gornek at the Den. ,"Seeing the deed you have done for me steels my heart. I cannot fall so easily! I must endure! But it remains that I cannot make the trek back to the Den unassisted. Please, <name>, return to the Den and tell Gornek of my situation. Perhaps he can help me. "
3701,A Strategic Alliance,Seek out Lar Prowltusk on the western flank of Sen'jin Village. ,"Thrall is a most wise and noble leader. His tenacity on the battlefield is matched only by his diplomatic tact. The Darkspear Trolls have proven to be invaluable allies to orckind. Out of loyalty and honor we have sworn a pact of protection with them. The Warchief has sent orders to make sure our Darkspear friends in Sen'jin Village are not under any direct threat. One of their most trusted scouts, Lar Prowltusk is keeping a close watch on their western flank. Seek out Lar and assist as needed. "
3702,Lazy Peons,Use the Foreman's Blackjack on Lazy Peons when they're sleeping. ,"Cursed peons!  They work hard gathering lumber from the trees of the valley, but they're always taking naps!  I need someone to help keep the peons in line. You look like the right <race> for my task.  Here, you take this blackjack and use it on any lazy peons you find sleeping on the job.  A good smack will get them right back to work!  Return the blackjack when you're done. Lousy slacking peons. . . "
3703,Practical Prey,Bring 4 Durotar Tiger Furs to Vel'rin Fang in Sen'jin Village. ,"Many of the hides we use come from Durotar tigers, <name>. Blankets, armor, tents: there are a great many reasons we hunt the beasts, and many reasons we let them thrive at the same time. The time has come for us to cull the flock, so to speak. Our numbers grow, and our needs are beginning to overwhelm our stocks. I need more hides if I'm to prepare suitable goods for our people. Bring me 4 Durotar tiger furs, and I shall reward you. You can find them on the islands south of here. "
3704,Vanquish the Betrayers,"Kill 10 Kul Tiras Sailors, 8 Kul Tiras Marines and Lieutenant Benedict and return to Gar'Thok in Razor Hill. ","Led by Admiral Proudmoore, the humans of Kul Tiras encroached on Durotar, violating the Warchief's pact made with Jaina Proudmoore in order to defeat Archimonde years ago. The human aggression was repelled and Tiragarde Keep fell. But recently, the Admiral's reserves, led by Lieutenant Benedict, have retaken the keep and once again pose a threat to our homeland. These humans show no respect for diplomacy. Prove your honor and travel south to Tiragarde Keep to eliminate the human invaders. "
3705,Cutting Teeth,Kill 8 Mottled Boars then return to Gornek at the Den. ,"The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead. I believe you would find a good match with the mottled boars you'll find to the north of here. "
3706,Da Perfect Spies,Capture 5 Sen'jin Frogs and attune them to Vanira's sight at her Sentry Totem. ,"Now, it would be foolish to go in blind 'ere, so I be creatin' some tiny spies to gather information for Vol'jin. He got to know what's goin' on over on de islands. I could use da help, if you be feelin' up to it. I tell ya how it's done. First, ya gotta catch de frogs. Dey like to stay in de shade of da palm trees around Sen'jin. Once ya have de frogs, bring 'em over here to my sentry totem an' attune dem to me sight. "
3707,The New Horde,Report to Gornek in the Den. ,"Throm'ka, <class>. I am Eitrigg, charged by Thrall to oversee the training of recruits. The Horde has changed from what it once was. There was a time where I left the Horde, disillusioned by the growing influence of the power-hungry pawns of the Burning Legion. During my exile, I was taken prisoner by a group of humans, but was rescued by the Warchief. Hearing his vision of the Horde free of demonic influence, guided by the shamans, I returned. Gornek will have further instructions for you. "
3708,Sting of the Scorpid,Get 8 Scorpid Worker Tails for Gornek in the Den. ,"Powerful warrior and awkward novice alike have fallen to the venomous sting of the scorpid. You will find large numbers of scorpids northwest of here. Bring me eight of their tails as proof of your prowess in battle. The antidote for their sting is actually made from venom extracted from their stingers. We keep large quantities of antidote for scorpid venom on hand to heal young bloods just like you. . . But I'm sure you won't be needing any of that, will you? "
3709,Welcome! ,Bring the Razor Hill Gift Voucher to Magga in Razor Hill. ,"Welcome to the World of Warcraft! As special thanks for purchasing the World of Warcraft Collector's Edition, turn in this gift voucher to Magga in Razor Hill.

3710,<UNUSED>,Bring 8 Shimmerweed to Master Vornal in Sen'jin Village. ,"Truly a spirit of strength resides in your body--or maybe it was only luck, yes? That is what the young rely on these days: luck. . . and the generosity of those more powerful than they. Not many take the time to find their own path. It's always begging for help. . . always the reward, and never the quest. I'm sure you'll be the same. But there is hope. I need one other thing for my potion, <name>: 8 shimmerweed herbs. They can be found in Thunder Ridge to the northwest of Razor Hill. "
3711,<UNUSED>,Bring 6 Small Scorpid Carapaces to Kor'ghan in Sen'jin Village. ,"You would do well to learn how dangerous this land can be, <class>. The wildlife here can teach us such things. . . if we are wise and observant. The scorpids are a perfect example of survival in Durotar. If you are to survive, it would be wise to take on some of their characteristics as your own. Their hardened carapaces can protect you from the harshness of the sun, or even a deadly weapon. Bring me 6 Small Scorpid Carapaces from the Clattering Scorpids, <name>, and I shall see about rewarding you justly. "
3712,<UNUSED>,Bring 10 Chunks of Boar Meat to Cook Torka in Razor Hill. ,"Cook and clean--that's all I do! You want to eat, you get me some more meat! I don't have all day to hunt and prepare food for all these louses. You got to learn to pull your own weight around here if you wanna be treated equal. Get me some Chunks of Boar Meat if you want to make yourself useful. . . or you don't want to starve to death. "
3713,<UNUSED>,Bring 5 Scorched Hearts to Orgnil Soulscar in Razor Hill. ,"My scouts report that some of the Durotar wildlife have become infected with a demonic taint.  They were seen to the north and west. They wander among their brethren as normal beasts, but evil powers flow through them, and burning within each one is a heart scorched by black magic. These beasts must be destroyed! If you find such an animal while you explore Durotar, kill it and collect its Scorched Heart.  Bring the hearts to me and I will have them studied, then destroyed. "
3714,The Grimtotem Weapon,Apprentice Garion at Tabetha's Farm wants you to test the Captured Totem on 10 Mottled Drywallow Crocolisks or Drywallow Daggermaws. ,"During the last Grimtotem attack, I was wounded, but not before I managed to capture a curious totem our enemies were using against us. It seemed to be emitting raw bolts of energy during the battle, but in all my experiments, I haven't managed to figure out how it works. I'll loan the totem to you if you agree to help me test it. The watery areas surrounding the farm are home to pesky mottled drywallow crocolisks and drywallow daggermaws. Try fighting the crocolisks near the totem. "
3715,Highperch Venom,Bring 10 Highperch Venom Sacs to Fiora Longears in Theramore. ,"As you may know, wyverns are often tamed by orcs for use as mounts.  But what is less known is that the venom of a wyvern, in some circles, is more valuable than the beast itself.  So if you're not afraid to do a little wyvern hunting, then. . . I have a job for you. There is a place called Highperch in the land of a Thousand Needles, west of here.  The Highperch wyverns have a potent venom.  Potent, and valuable. "
3716,Nat's Bargain,Nat Pagle at Nat's Landing wants you to test his new fish bait. ,"So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes. But you want to know about Tethyr.  I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet. Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim over to that wrecked ship to the southwest. If you survive, let me know how it works! "
3717,Corrosion Prevention,Moxie Steelgrille wants you to dissolve 10 oozes and report back to her at Beezil's Wreck. ,"Just look at this area! It's swarming with oozes. If I don't find some way to keep them under control, they'll corrode the wreckage and the zeppelin's cargo! I can't go back empty-handed, <class>! Help me dissolve these oozes before they've digested everything! This device, when powered, will concentrate energy on the slimes, causing them to explode. The zeppelin's fragmented power core should power the device. The one near the main crash works all the time, but the others flicker on and off. "
3718,Survey Alcaz Island,Speak to Cassa Crimsonwing and use one of her gryphons to survey Alcaz Island. ,"It looks like Renn's hunch about Alcaz Island was right. We need to survey that island, but it would take a whole brigade of troops to fight our way in there. Theramore's defenses can't weather such a hit, so I've arranged with Cassa Crimsonwing, the apprentice to Theramore's gryphon master, to allow you to use one of her beasts to survey Alcaz from the air. Alcaz Island holds the key to the mystery of the Defias' involvement in this kidnapping. "
3719,Marg Speaks,Bring the Jeweled Pendant to Nazeer in Brackenwall Village. ,"Cursed muckshell!  You can't kill Marg!  Ah, but I am dead.  So it must have slain me. . . But my mission!  My mission!  You, <name>, must complete it. While near Theramore, I spied a group of Alliance soldiers camped on the beach.  And one soldier wore a pendant. . . a pendant laden with more gems than any soldier could afford! That night I snuck into their camp and stole the pendant, but on my return to base a muckshell crab-man killed me! <name>, you must find that muckshell and recover the pendant! "
3720,Secondhand Diving Gear,Bring the Tool Kit and Damaged Diving Gear to Renn McGill in the Dustwallow Marsh. ,"There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative ""borrowing"" first. Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time! "
3721,The Theramore Docks,Bring the Captain's Documents to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village. ,"<name>, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks.  They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea. One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize.  He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you. The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks.  Find those documents, <name>, and bring them to me. "
3722,Take Down Tethyr! ,Major Mills at the Theramore docks wants you to defeat Tethyr. ,"Sea monster or no, we're not going to risk the safety of our shipping. I've ordered our best marksmen to prepare for a confrontation with this Tethyr. The artillerymen have augmented the dock's defenses with three mortars. I'm going to order the lighthouse's lamp illuminated. If Tethyr does attack, it will be your job to operate the mortars and take down the beast before it can kill all of the marksmen. I wouldn't stand in one place too long, though. Using the mortars is likely to draw its attention. "
3723,Jarl Needs Eyes,"Bring 20 Unpopped Darkmist Eyes to ""Swamp Eye"" Jarl at the Swamplight Manor. ","Eye juice is good juice for drinking.  Too bad most critters only have two eyes. But spiders have lots of eyes.  Lots and lots.  And Darkmist eye juice is tasty.  Smooth and salty!  Unpopped spider eyes. . . I taste them already. Darkmist spiders are west of here, in the Darkmist Cavern.  You figure the spiders are named after the cave. . . or is it the other way around? "
3724,The Reagent Thief,Bring 6 vials of Marsh Venom to Apprentice Garion at Tabetha's Farm. ,"If there's one thing you can count on Apprentice Morlann to do, it's whine about reagents. Normally, I just ignore him, and it never works. This time, I'm going to try something different. Maybe if I replace the missing reagents before he notices, he'll leave me alone. The most common reagent we both use is marsh venom, which comes from the darkfang creepers and noxious shredders in the marsh north of the farm. If you bring me the venom, I'll replace it before Morlann notices it's gone. "
3725,Deadmire,Bring Deadmire's Tooth to Melor in Thunder Bluff. ,"Deadmire is an ancient crocolisk in Dustwallow marsh.  And it is his time to die. Old bones grind as he pulls his huge body through the swamp, and although he still moves with the strength and speed of youth, his aging body tortures the great spirit within it, a spirit whose flame will not waver. Yet now he lives in constant, maddening pain.  You must end the life of this noble creature, <name>.  You must lead Deadmire to peace. "
3726,Jarl Needs a Blade,"Bring Razorspine's Sword to ""Swamp Eye"" Jarl at Swamplight Manor. ","I have cutting to do.  I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but. . . I need myself a blade.  A certain blade. . . Some people call it a sword.  I call it a swing blade. You help me?  Those fish-men, you know, murlocs or whatever they're called. . . . There's one they call Razorspine, carries a big sword, lives north of here near the beach. That's the sword I need! But don't sleep on this.  What I'm cutting won't keep forever. . . "
3727,Confirming the Suspicion,Bring the Grimtotem Battle Plan to Captain Darill at North Point Tower. ,"The Grimtotems may be the most warlike of all the tauren clans, but they're by no means unorganized. If they're the ones who put the torch to the Shady Rest Inn, they'll have had orders from one of their clan elders. There's a large Grimtotem settlement called Blackhoof Village to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek. "
3728,The Troll Witchdoctor,Take the Defiant Orc Head to Kin'weelay in the Grom'gol Base Camp in Stranglethorn Vale. ,"We must know the events surrounding Marg's death!  And the only way to do that, <name>, is through the witch-magic of trolls. Bring Marg's head to Kin'weelay in Stranglethorn Vale, at the Grom'gol Base Camp. Kin'weelay is the most powerful witchdoctor of the Darkspear trolls.  If anyone can speak to Marg Nighteye's spirit, it is he. "
3729,Raze Direhorn Post! ,"Burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post, then return to Tabetha at her farm. ","There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new ""neighbors"" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer. Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor. "
3730,Challenge to the Black Flight,"Plant the Stonemaul Banner near the entrance to Onyxia's Lair, wait for Onyxia's response, then return to Brogg at Mudsprocket. ","Brogg relishes the thought of taking his revenge on the black dragonkin of the marsh. <name>, you have been very helpful in preparing for this moment. Will you help? Take Brogg 's clan banner and travel east until you see a cave like a dragon's mouth. At the entrance to that cave, plant Stonemaul banner and issue Brogg 's challenge to Onyxia. Brogg and the Stonemaul will have their lands back! "
3731,The Severed Head,Bring the Defiant Orc Head to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village. ,"Vigorous digging reveals the head of a male orc, raggedly severed at the neck.  His lips are frozen in a snarl, and its dark eyes stare defiantly. "
3732,The Brood of Onyxia,Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village wants you to destroy 5 Eggs of Onyxia. ,"Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the Dragonmurk. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch. Make haste to Wyrmbog in the south of Dustwallow Marsh. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them. We will never reclaim Stonemaul Village if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground. As for Mok'Morokk. . . I have other plans for the sod. "
3733,Morgan Stern,Speak with Morgan Stern in Theramore. ,"I'm developing a new menu for the restaurant.  It will be filled with rural dishes with a ""bayou"" theme.  I think my clientele at the Blue Recluse will love them! I sent my nephew Morgan to Theramore, a city on the edge of the Dustwallow Marsh.  He's there gathering recipes from the locals, and I must know what he found so far. The trip to Theramore is long.  Too long for me.  But I bet a young <class> like yourself would jump at the chance to travel, yes? "
3734,"The Test of Skulls, Scryer","You must find the blue dragonflight drake champion, Scryer, and slay him. ","We are Deathwing's children, whelp. Our dominance over the lesser Aspects must be enforced. If you are truly worthy of ascension, the lesser dragonflight will wilt in your presence. Find their champions and lay waste to them in the name of our Father! Travel to Winterspring and track down the mighty blue drake, Scryer. Crush him and any of the Blue Flight that stand in your path. Tear out his skull and return it to me. "
3735,. . . and Bugs,Bring 12 Pristine Crawler Legs to Morgan Stern in Theramore. ,"Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab.  And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- Muckshells they call them -- just won't do!  I'm afraid the only suitable crabs live far away, in the Swamp of Sorrows. The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs.  An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish. So, <name>. . . are you willing to travel? "
3736,I See Alcaz Island In Your Future. . . ,Gather 20 Bloodkelp from the Strashaz naga and then return to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain. ,"As I was saying, <class>, in my living years I flirted with becoming a diviner. But, there really wasn't as much profit in it as you might imagine, mostly because it's dangerous and the reagents are rare and expensive. However, I do know enough to be able to pinpoint the final piece of the amulet, and the spirit of my former comrade along with it. This is where you come in, <name>. I need you to go to Alcaz Island off the coast of Dustwallow Marsh and collect Bloodkelp from the Strashaz naga that live there. "
3737,Recover the Cargo! ,Bring 6 Salvaged Strongboxes to Renn McGill in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though. The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce. "
3738,Challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk,Defeat Mok'Morokk and report the news to Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village. ,You dare challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk? Haw! Me crush tiny <race>! You tell me when ready for good beating. 
3739,Lieutenant Paval Reethe,Bring Reethe's Badge to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing away debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore. Underneath the anchor is embossed the name ""Lieutenant Paval Reethe"". "
3740,WANTED: Goreclaw the Ravenous,Kill Goreclaw the Ravenous and report to Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket. ,"Travelers and Steamwheedle personnel working in the field are advised to avoid the Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town. The area is overrun with raptors lead by the cruel and cunning Goreclaw the Ravenous, who has already killed at least two Steamwheedle engineers. Drazzit Dripvalve has authorized a generous reward to be paid to the individual who rids Mudsprocket of this menace. "
3741,The Grimtotem Plot,Bring the Grimtotem Battle Plan to Krog at Brackenwall Village. ,"With the activities of the Grimtotems in Thousand Needles brought to light, many tauren now regard them with suspicion.  We've seen high-ranking Grimtotems engage in murder and kidnapping to advance their interests and I fear we may become their next target. Blackhoof Village, to the northeast, near Bluefen, is a large new Grimtotem settlement. Their leaders, the elders, will all have orders from Thunder Bluff. See if you can capture the orders and piece them together to learn the Grimtotems' plans. "
3742,"The Test of Skulls, Somnus","Destroy the drake champion of the Green Flight, Somnus. ","Just as our Father crushes the Aspects themselves, so too must we strive to bring chaos and destruction to their children. You must test your battle prowess against the sleepless dreamers: The children of the Green Flight. Travel to the Swamp of Sorrows and track down Somnus, drake champion of the Green Flight. Let flow your hatred; dominate the insect. . . Return to me with his skull. . . "
3743,Theramore Spies,"Kill 9 Theramore Infiltrators, then return to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village. ","The Horde and Alliance hold an uneasy truce.  Outlying skirmishes and covert actions are taken by one side against the other, and it is our duty to ensure the Horde is on top! Now is the chance to do just that. Alliance infiltrators have taken positions east of Brackenwall Village.  They spy on the village and report our movements to Theramore, which we cannot allow. Hunt down the infiltrators and slay them.  Send a clear message to their superiors that we will not tolerate their spies' presence! "
3744,"The Test of Skulls, Axtroz","Travel to Grim Batol and track down Axtroz, drake champion of the Red Flight. ","It was over the mountains of Grim Batol that our Father raged against the combined might of the Aspects. The cowardly act of the betrayer, Alexstrasza, bought the other Aspects enough time to escape from Father's wrath. Sssuch a shameful act. . . The Red Flight now guards Grim Batol, their lieutenant, Axtroz, must be destroyed. Return the skull of Axtroz to me. For Father, whelp! "
3745,The Deserters,Get information about Reethe from Balos Jacken and the deserters in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"It has been a struggle maintaining a presence in the marsh, but through strength of our resolve, we have been able to maintain several defensive watchtowers throughout the area. The latest information and scouting reports I have received indicate that a group of deserters has squatted in our abandoned tower at Lost Point, southeast of the inn. The local lieutenant seems to be Balos Jacken. See if you can get some information out of him. Be warned, <name>. He may be a tough nut to crack. "
3746,Identifying the Brood,Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village would like you to bring him 7 Searing Tongues and 7 Searing Hearts. ,"Whilst that craven fool, Mok'Morokk, wallows in power and Tharg wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home. Why the puzzled stare, <name>? Expecting me to speak like an uncouth ruffian merely because I am an ogre? Now back to business, bring to me the hearts and tongues from the whelps and hatchlings. I shall trace the root of this evil. . . "
3747,Twilight of the Dawn Runner,Balandar Brightstar in Brackenwall Village wants you to reclaim the Dawn Runner Cargo and rescue his first mate Ithania from forces of Theramore at North Point Tower. ,"The ogres here are useful for little more than crude jokes, sour ale, and bouts of headbutting. When my ship, the Dawn Runner, ran aground, those curs from Theramore made off with my cargo and last surviving crewman. I made my way here searching for help, but those good-for-nothing ogres stared blankly at me when I told them my story. I could use the help of a reliable <race> in recovering what remains of my cargo and freeing Ithania from North Point Tower, to the northeast, where they're being held. "
3748,Mudrock Soup and Bugs,Bring 8 Forked Mudrock Tongues to Morgan Stern in Theramore. ,"I'm working on a dish I call ""Mudrock Soup and Bugs. ""  I still need the major ingredients, and. . . well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through Dustwallow Marsh! So, <name>, can you do some hunting for me?  First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles.  You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay. But I don't want just any tongues!  I hear that the tongues of some Mudrocks are forked. . . They say the forked tongues have a distinct flavor, and I want that flavor in my dish. . . "
3749,They Call Him Smiling Jim,Speak with Captain Garran Vimes on the top floor of Foothold Citadel. ,"I can't help it if I feel sorry for ol' Jim there. He wasn't always like that. Ran an inn out in the marsh for a while, wonderful place. Look, I don't really want to talk about it. Bring it up with Captain Vimes if you really have to. He's stationed on the top floor of Foothold Citadel, the large barracks to the east of Lady Jaina's tower. "
3750,The Black Shield,Bring the Blackened Iron Shield to Krog in Brackenwall Village. ,"An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn. The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney. "
3751,Lieutenant Paval Reethe,Find out more about Reethe from Adjutant Tesoran in Theramore. ,"I don't recognize the name of Lieutenant Paval Reethe. Your best bet would be to check with Adjutant Tesoran. He keeps track of all the records for the Theramore guard, from personnel to their equipment. He should be able to tell you who this Reethe is with a quick check of his books. "
3752,Overlord Mok'Morokk's Concern,"Overlord Mok'Morokk in Brackenwall Village wants you to retrieve his grog, snuff and strongbox in Dustwallow Swamp. ","Bow before Overlord Mok'Morokk! Rexxar make me mighty leader of Stonemaul Clan! Me good leader. Me keep clan safe. Big dragons come and make fire at old home. Me smart ogre. Find new home for clan here. Leave old home so fast, me forget stuff. Tiny <race>, go get my things. Go south and find my yummy grog, my snuff and my strongbox. Me like you after you do that. You look in Den of Flame and Stonemaul Ruins. . . they be there, me sure! "
3753,"The Test of Skulls, Chronalis","Guarding the Caverns of Time in the Tanaris Desert is Chronalis, child of Nozdormu. ","The time watchers, children of Nozdormu - Lord of the Centuriesss. . . It is three that guard the Caverns of Time, but only one that holds the interests of the Black Flight: The Time Shifter, Chronalis, favored drakeling of Nozdormu. Ssstrike at this champion, a blow to make even the stoic sands of time weep. Return to me with his skull. "
3754,Service to the Horde,It will take time for our scholars to study the pendant you brought us. ,"It will take time for our scholars to study the pendant you brought us.  But for your service to the Horde I would like to offer you a small token. Thank you, <name>.  Your acts bring honor to you, and to us. "
3755,Inspecting the Ruins,The non-deprecated versions are located here: Inspecting the Ruins / Inspecting the Ruins. ,"If you follow the road south from the village, and then west toward the Barrens, you'll come across the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. Theramore has sent an investigator to discover how the inn met its fate. Normally, I'd advise you to steer clear, but we have orders from Orgrimmar to 'assist' in the investigation. Accept any help the Theramore investigator offers, even feed him a tidbit or two of information if you'd like, but save your real findings for me. "
3756,Suspicious Hoofprints,Report about the suspicious prints at the Shady Rest Inn to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh. "
3757,The Black Shield,Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Mosarn in Thunder Bluff. ,"Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before. In thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work. Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted. It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have. "
3758,Raptor Captor,Sergeant Lukas at North Point Tower wants you to capture 6 raptors. ,"The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our Grimtotem neighbors. Take this rope and use it to capture bloodfen raptors or bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle. "
3759,Thresher Oil,Bring 4 containers of Thresher Oil to Babs Fizzletorque at the lighthouse near Theramore. ,"The old log in the lighthouse indicates that the lamp was fueled with oil from the threshers that live along the coast here. <Babs wrinkles her nose at the mention of such outdated technology. >I suppose it's a practical, if inelegant solution. The log says that the oil taken from the youngest murk threshers works the best, and those live right underneath the docks of Theramore. If you're up for it, would you help resupply the lighthouse with fuel? "
3760,Proof of Treachery,Speak to King Varian Wrynn in Stormwind Keep. ,"Although Onyxia has been exposed and removed from the court, the Defias who carried out her plan must be punished. Carry word to King Varian Wrynn in Stormwind castle that the Defias are the ones who carried out his kidnapping. I have little doubt that the king will mete out swift and terrible justice to those involved. I can use my magic to expedite your trip to Stormwind. Just speak to me when you're prepared to go, <name>. "
3761,Discrediting the Deserters,"Calia Hastings wants you to distribute the Altered Leaflets to 6 Theramore Guards, then report back to her near the docks in Theramore. ","I've altered the leaflets you captured from the deserters' mercenary friends at the docks. Now, anyone who reads them will get an entirely different view of the deserters and their aims. If we distribute these to enough of the guards, the deserters will be too embarrassed to ever reestablish their presence within our walls. <Calia hands you a stack of the altered leaflets. >Why don't you get started while I plan our next move? "
3762,Propaganda War,Bring the Deserter Propaganda to Calia Hastings near the docks in Theramore. ,"The deserter agents were doing far more than just chatting up the guards. We've found a number of leaflets the deserters somehow managed to smuggle in on a ship in the docks. The ship used to transport the leaflets is still in Theramore, at the farthest dock. If you can sneak aboard and capture the rest of their propaganda documents, their agents will lose their most powerful tool. Be careful! The ship is manned by seasoned privateers and the cargo is probably being kept in the captain's quarters. "
3763,Jaina Must Know,Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore. ,"You must bring news of our findings to Lady Jaina without delay! If the Defias were transporting a prisoner, there's no telling who it might be or if the person is still alive! One thing is for certain, <name>. The Defias wouldn't go to all this trouble for some petty grudge. Their prisoner must have been someone of importance. Lady Jaina would know better than anyone else what these findings mean. You'll find her at the top of the mage tower at Theramore's center. "
3764,Tabetha's Assistance,Speak with Tabetha at her farm. ,"I can't spare any men to help search for a second Grimtotem outpost, but I think I know of someone who might be able to help you. Deep in the Quagmire, to the south, there is a small farmstead owned by Tabetha. She may seem little more than an old hermit, but the truth is that she's a mage and scryer of some renown. Follow the road south to her farm and seek her help in finding the culprits responsible for the massacre at the Shady Rest Inn. "
3765,Direhorn Raiders,Kill 12 Direhorn Grimtotems and return to Apprentice Morlann at Tabetha's Farm. ,"The Grimtotems up at Direhorn Post, just to the north, are getting bolder by the day. At night, you can often hear them chanting about their deeds in battle against people who've tried to settle here. They're determined to drive us from Tabetha's farm even though she's trained generations of apprentices here. We've defended the farm as best we can, but Apprentice Garion was wounded in the last attack. Go to Direhorn Post and kill any Grimtotem you can find! The attacks must stop. "
3766,Is it Real? ,Talk to Nat Pagle at Nat's Landing in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"Oh, I'm sure you and Babs had a good laugh over the outlandish descriptions and sketches in the book, but have you stopped to consider there might be some truth to the legends? If you listen closely enough, I bet you can still hear sailors talk about Tethyr, the sea creature the book says lives right here! Of course, if you wanted to know for sure, you could always ask old Nat Pagle. He's got a small fishing camp on a little island in Tidefury Cove, which is southwest across Dustwallow Bay. "
3767,The Hermit of Witch Hill,"Speak with ""Swamp Eye"" Jarl at Swamplight Manor. ","The marsh seems to have a strange effect on humans. Some grow mad simply by living here. Anyone who has ever settled at Swamplight Manor has gone mad in a spectacular way. The latest owner, one ""Swamp Eye"" Jarl, is already showing signs. I don't completely understand what's happening there, you'd have my thanks for looking into it. The manor is at the eastern edge of the swamp. Trek east across Bluefen and past North Point Tower. The manor is in a haunted patch of land called Witch Hill. "
3768,Questioning Reethe,"Go with Ogron to speak with Reethe, then return to Krog in Brackenwall Village. ","It took a long time, but I found Reethe. He hide good for a human. Ogron worried that he might be crazy after so much time in swamp. You come with me for we go get answers from him. "
3769,The Black Shield,Talk with Krog in Brackenwall Village. ,"Oh, I think I might have dropped too much acid onto the shield. Let me just rub a little. . . Hm, kind of hard to read, but it looks like the name Mosarn. Never heard of him. Maybe Krog knows. Krog knows many people. "
3770,Arms of the Grimtotems,Captain Darill at North Point Tower wants you to bring him 7 Blackhoof Armaments. ,"If the equipment you found at the ruins of the inn belonged to a Grimtotem attack party, there's likely to be more just like it within their camp to the northwest. We haven't been able to gather much information about Blackhoof Village, but judging from the size of the raiding parties, there's a substantial force based there. Do whatever you have to to capture some of their equipment so that we can compare it with your findings from the inn. "
3771,The Lost Report,Bring the Spy's Report to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village. ,"Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment. The parchment is a report made by an orc who spent weeks spying on the city of Theramore. After scanning the parchment, it is clear that it must be brought to the orc spymaster in Brackenwall Village. "
3772,A Grim Connection,Report to Captain Darill at North Point. ,"I've spoken with Inspector Tarem regarding the evidence you gathered from the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. He seems certain that the hoofprints and the shield you found there point to the Grimtotem clan of tauren. With reports of Grimtotem activity on the rise in the marsh, this has to be more than a mere coincidence. I'm sending you to speak with Captain Darill, who is something of an expert on the Grimtotems. Follow the road north out of town to North Point tower. It's the second outpost on the road. "
3773,Spirits of Stonemaul Hold,"Brogg, at Mudsprocket, wants you to put 10 Stonemaul Spirits to rest. ","Brogg has completed the totem that will put the spirits of his friends to rest. When the dragonkin came, they killed all Stonemaul who did not flee. Brogg fled with Overlord Mok'Morokk, hoping to lead a counterattack with other Stonemaul survivors. The counterattack never came and the spirits of the Stonemaul dead still haunt Brogg and the others. Take this totem north to Stonemaul Ruins and use it near ogre skeletons to draw the spirit to you. Defeat the spirit to give it rest with its bones. "
3774,Army of the Black Dragon,"Tharg in Brackenwall Village wants you to kill 10 Firemane Scouts, 10 Firemane Ash Tails, and 5 Firemane Scalebanes. ",Mok'Morokk was made Overlord by Rexxar. He care more for power than he care for ogres. Black dragons kill many ogre. Kill Tharg 's wife. Mok'Morokk tell us to run. Make us come here. Ogre should fight. Ogres not good at running. Mok'Morokk care only about Mok'Morokk. Me call Stonemaul Ruins home. Me like it in the south. This place not home. Help ogres fight army of the black dragon. Me want revenge. Me want to go home. 
3775,Inspecting the Ruins,Speak to Inspector Tarem at the Shady Rest Inn. ,"Poor James never recovered from the destruction of the Shady Rest and the murder of his family. The boys and I are doing what we can to find the monsters who did this. I've sent our best investigator, Inspector Tarem, out to the ruins, but this is too big a job for any one man. If you'd lend Tarem a hand, we'd appreciate it. Light knows, we'd all like to be out there helping. The main road will lead you to the inn, but take care. Your journey will take you beyond the protection of my soldiers. "
3776,Bloodfen Feathers,Bring 5 Bloodfen Feathers to Brogg at Mudsprocket. ,"Are you startled by Brogg 's presence here, little <race>? Don't worry. Goblins at Mudsprocket are Brogg 's friends and you can be, too. Brogg left Brackenwall Village when new overlord not take revenge against black dragonkin for destroying old home and killing many of Brogg 's old friends. Brogg come here to lay friends spirits to rest and avenge them, but Brogg need help preparing. For ritual, Brogg need feathers with strong magic, like ones worn by raptors at Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town. "
3777,Captain Vimes,Bring the Spy's Report to Captain Garran Vimes. ,"Captain Vimes should see the orc report you found, <name>.  He knows the orcish language better than most.  And he should know that there are Horde spies near Theramore! The captain is in the barracks, on the northeastern side of Theramore Isle. "
3778,Report to Zor,Bring the Jeweled Pendant to Zor Lonetree in Orgrimmar. ,"It is strange that the pendant Marg stole was in the hands of common soldiers.  Perhaps its owner was in disguise, or perhaps the soldiers themselves stole it! Regardless of which is true, this is a noble's pendant and we must discover its true owner if we are to unravel its mystery. Take the pendant to Zor Lonetree in Orgrimmar.  He is well schooled in Alliance politics, and will know if this pendant has a history among the nobles of Stormwind. "
3779,The Essence of Enmity,Bring 10 Black Dragonkin Essences to Brogg at Mudsprocket. ,"To make the totem Brogg will need for his ritual, he must use the essences of the creatures who killed his friends. The hate and anger of Brogg 's enemies will fuel the magic of his vengeance. Track down Firemane ash tails, scouts, or scalebanes and use Brogg's totem on their corpses. Only when the dragonkin die will they give up their essences. The creatures you seek swarm over the Den of Flame to the northwest and the Stonemaul Ruins to the north. "
3780,Hungry! ,Mudcrush Durtfeet in northern Dustwallow wants 8 Mirefin Heads. ,Mud big ogre. Me hungry. Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you. 
3781,The Black Shield,Bring the Blackened Iron Shield to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn. The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney. "
3782,A Disturbing Development,Report to Captain Wymor at Sentry Point. ,"Reports from our scout patrols have recently taken a disturbing turn. They tell of men wearing red Defias bandanas walking the Dreadmurk Shore north of Theramore's walls. Wreckage in the area suggests they may be survivors of a shipwreck, but our information is limited. Captain Wymor at Sentry Point, a guard tower to the north of the city, is looking for help in following up on the reports. "
3783,What's Haunting Witch Hill? ,Mordant Grimsby at Swamplight Manor wants you to gather information from 10 Risen Husks or Risen Spirits. ,"I traveled out here to pay Jarl a visit at his new home and it's been a nonstop horror show ever since! There's something seriously wrong here and I can't be the only one who sees it. . . Have you seen the ghosts and corpses shambling about Witch Hill? I've a feeling that if anyone knows what happened here, it is them. Seek out these risen husks and risen spirits in the surrounding area, grant them rest through combat, and see what you can learn from them before this evil consumes Jarl! "
3784,The Apothecary's Letter,Bring the Sealed Letter to Andello Porter at Tabetha's Farm. ,"Recovered from the body of a Forsaken apothecary, this letter contains alarming evidence of a close alliance between the Grimtotems and the new masters of Lordaeron. ""As a demonstration of good faith and a symbol of our newfound trust, we have dispatched Apothecary Cylla to aid you in battling our mutual enemy in the land of Kalimdor. None will stand before our combined might and determination. ""This letter should be brought to the attention of the SI: 7 agent at Tabetha's Farm, Andello Porter. "
3785,"Oh, It's Real",Speak with Major Mills at the docks in Theramore. ,"Yes, Tethyr is certainly real, and he lives in the waters off Theramore. Has a thing for bright lights. He's the reason they shut down the lighthouse in the first place, you know. . . And if you light it up again, he'll come right back. But no one in their right mind would do that. So that must be your plan! It's been good sharing a drink with you, but don't blame ol' Nat if Tethyr REALLY turns you into fish bait. If you're going to do this, make sure you consult Major Mills at the Theramore docks. "
3786,Mission to Mudsprocket,Speak with Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket. ,"The Steamwheedle Cartel has recently established a new outpost in the southern part of Dustwallow Marsh. It's called Mudsprocket, if I recall, and it's located on the main road south out of Tabetha's Farm and the Stonemaul Ruins. This is an excellent opportunity for us to establish new trade contacts and Lady Jaina wants me to send a representative down there to establish contact. Would you be willing to go? "
3787,The End of the Deserters,"Capture Gavis Greyshield, then report to Calia Hastings near the docks in Theramore. ","Now that we've eliminated the deserters from Theramore, it's time to complete this operation. My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks. Arresting their leader, Gavis Greyshield, should cause the others to lose their will to fight. Find him within the ship and convince him to surrender. I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up a bit of a fight for show, but then surrenders when he understands he can't win. "
3788,More than Coincidence,Krog at Brackenwall Village wants you to bring him 7 Blackhoof Armaments. ,"We've gleaned as much as we can from the ruins of the inn. I'm concerned about where the investigation will lead us from here, but we must know the truth. Between the hoofprints and the shield with Mosarn's mark, I'm lead to believe that the Grimtotems may have been involved. They've recently established a settlement in the swamp, Blackhoof Village to the northeast. Travel to Blackhoof Village and search for more arms of Mosarn's manufacture. "
3789,Feast at the Blue Recluse,"My nephew said you aided him with his research in Dustwallow, and that you helped his associate out of a tight spot. ","My nephew said you aided him with his research in Dustwallow, and that you helped his associate out of a tight spot.  Well, we Sterns stick together and we don't ignore our friends! So wash your hands, <name>, because we're about to throw a party in your honor! "
3790,Ascension. . . ,It would appear as if the charade is over. ,"From the skulls of our enemies is shaped a medallion. You know this medallion, yesss? You have no doubt seen it worn by your elders. Take it, whelp. Return to the Spire and present it to General Drakkisath. The General will place the final enchantment upon the medallion, attuning the trinket to your spirit. You will wear the finished medallion as a badge of honor, symbolizing your ascension to one of our most guarded ranks: Guardian to the brood mother. Go! "
3791,Cleansing Witch Hill,Mordant Grimsby at Swamplight Manor wants you to plant the torch at the end of the dock and defeat anything that appears. ,"The torch is ready. Plant it at the end of the dock and be prepared to face whatever comes forth. I have no idea what the torch's smoke may reveal. . . if anything emerges at all. I must say, I have my doubts about this kind of folk magic, but we haven't time for anything else. For your sake and Jarl's, I wish you luck. "
3792,This Old Lighthouse,Speak to Babs Fizzletorque at the lighthouse on the island east of Theramore. ,"The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten it into her head to get it working again. I don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know? "
3793,Banner of the Stonemaul,Retrieve the Stonemaul Banner and bring it to Brogg at Mudsprocket. ,"When the dragons came and took over Brogg 's old home, Stonemaul ogres fled and left everything behind, including clan's banner. Brogg knows banner was kept deep in Stonemaul ogre mound, but these days it's called Den of Flame. Brogg must have clan banner to get his revenge on dragons who killed his friends. Brogg 's clan's old mound, Den of Flame, is northwest of Mudsprocket and crawling with dragonkin. Banner will be deep inside the cave. Be careful, <name>. "
3794,The Zeppelin Crash,Speak with Moxie Steelgrille at Beezil's Wreck. ,"Not long ago, a goblin zeppelin crashed to the east. A representative of the Steamwheedle Cartel passed through here a few days ago. She was looking for information about the zeppelin's cargo and it's pilot, Beezil, but none of us really got a good look at the crash. I doubt she'll be able to clean up after the wreck by herself, much less recover whatever cargo the vessel might have carried. If you have time, you may want to check up on her out at Beezil's Wreck, due east of here, near the mountains. "
3795,Suspicious Hoofprints,Report about the suspicious prints at the Shady Rest Inn to Krog in Brackenwall Village. ,"Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh. "
3796,The Black Shield,Acquire 5 Acidic Venom Sacs for Do'gol in Brackenwall Village. ,"Hmmm, there's writing right here on the rim of the shield, but it's hard to read from all the burned stuff. I need acid to make it clear. Venom from the darkmist spiders would do good. The spiders have taken over an old mine, the Darkmist Cavern, northwest of the village. Get me some of their sacs and I can clean this up. "
3797,Unleash the Raptors,Sergeant Lukas at North Point Tower wants you to place the Raptor Bait near the windmill in Blackhoof Village. ,"Now that we've got our raptors, our next move is to ""encourage"" them to attack the Grimtotems at Blackhoof Village to the northwest. I've got a leftover haunch of. . . well, it doesn't really matter what it is. It'll be your bait. Set it down on the ground in Blackhoof Village near the windmill in the center of the settlement. The raptors should take care of the rest, if their training took. "
3798,Delivery for Drazzit,Take the Zeppelin Cargo to Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket. ,"Drazzit will expect to hear something from me soon, but I don't think the site is secure enough for me to leave. If you have time, would you be willing to take some of the salvaged cargo down to him at Mudsprocket? If you haven't been there yet, it's a small settlement to the southwest of here, beyond the Stonemaul Ruins. You can take the road there from Tabetha's Farm, too. When you get to Mudsprocket, the guy you're looking for is Drazzit Dripvalve. "
3799,Catch a Dragon by the Tail,Gizzix Grimegurgle at Mudsprocket wants you to bring him 8 Wyrmtail stalks. ,"With the zeppelin crash delaying supplies, we've run out of medicines and bandages. We're making use of what we can, but between all the insects, the injuries, and the enemies we're encountering here, I can barely keep up! I've found one herb that seems to help heal wounds and dull pain, but it, too, is in short supply. It's called wyrmtail, and it's abundant in the Dragonmurk and Wyrmbog areas east of town. The plants themselves are made of coiled stalks, and seem to pulsate when you look at them. "
3800,Defias in Dustwallow? ,Obtain the Defias Orders from Garn Mathers and bring them to Captain Wymor at Sentry Point. ,"My scouts have reported a shipwreck just off the beach to the northeast. Shipwrecks aren't all that unusual out here, but the reports also indicated the survivors were all wearing red bandanas! The Defias are craftsmen and guildsmen, not sailors. What are they doing at the site of a shipwreck on a continent they've no interest in? Their leader is rumored to reside on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession. "
3801,Secure the Cargo! ,Moxie Steelgrille at Beezil's Wreck wants you to recover 8 pieces of Zeppelin Cargo. ,"This zeppelin was carrying six months' worth of supplies to us at Mudsprocket! Sure, they've been able to barter for some of what they need, but they won't hold out forever. I've been sent out here to recover what I can of the cargo, but the wreckage is scattered all over the marsh in this area. I'm sure a lot of the cargo didn't survive the crash, but are you willing to help me recover what we can? "
3802,The Brood of Onyxia,Speak with Overlord Mok'Morokk in Brackenwall Village. ,"Stonemaul Village was invaded by the brood of Onyxia. But why would the daughter of the black dragonlord, Deathwing, descend upon our lands? This is most troubling. Surely, Onyxia was driven here for a purpose beyond laying siege to a small band of ogres. Notify Mok'Morokk at once! Action must be taken. "
3803,The Black Shield,Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Caz Twosprocket in Theramore. ,"I'm sorry I can't be of much help, <name>, but I can refer you to someone who would be. Caz Twosprocket, one of our best blacksmiths, works the forge at the smithy. Take the shield to him, and see what he can tell you. "
3804,Traitors Among Us,Confront 5 Deserter Agitators and return to Calia Hastings near the docks in Theramore. ,"It's good to meet you, <class>. I've come to Theramore to help eliminate the problem of the deserters. Not only have some of the men abandoned their posts, but some have filtered back into the town. These deserter agents are spreading lies and propaganda, hoping to convince others to join their ranks. They're at virtually every guard post throughout the town and the docks. Find them, expose them, and discredit them. At this point, anything more risks inspiring more sympathy for them. "
3805,Peace at Last,Captain Garran Vimes at Foothold Citadel wants you to lay the Wreath at the Hyal Family Monument. ,"I wish we had a way of letting James Hyal's wife and son know that we have brought their murderers to justice. <Captain Vimes produces a small wreath decorated with flowers. >There are some who say that their spirits will know, even if we cannot reach them. It's not much, but I'd like you to lay this wreath at the Hyal family monument. It's one of the larger stones in the graveyard just north of Theramore's gates. "
3806,Return to Jaina,Speak to Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore. ,"I must make plans to destroy the remnants of the Defias. Please convey my thanks to Lady Jaina, back in Theramore. She has ever been a loyal friend and steadfast ally. Go to the Mage Quarter at the western end of the city and speak with Archmage Malin at the foot of the tower there. He will speed your return to Theramore. "
3808,Justice for the Hyals,Speak to Captain Garran Vimes at Foothold Citadel in Theramore. ,"Although these Grimtotems were simply a nuisance to me, Captain Vimes will want to know of your deeds. Bring him the news that you have tracked down and dealt with those responsible for the burning of the Shady Rest Inn. It's too late to save Jim Hyal's family, but perhaps the Grimtotems will think twice before attacking anyone connected to Theramore. "
3809,Check Up on Tabetha,Speak to Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire. ,"A human woman named Tabetha lives on a small farm near the middle of the marsh. Ordinarily, I wouldn't associate with a human, but her help has proven useful at times. Unfortunately, she's been out of touch for quite some time now and I'm looking for someone to travel down to her farm to see if everything's all right. If you follow the road south out of the village, then into the swamp's interior, you'll find her farm near the middle of the Quagmire. "
3810,Stinky's Escape,"Escort ""Stinky"" Ignatz, then speak with Morgan Stern in Theramore. ","Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me! I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>. The cook Morgan Stern is researching a new recipe, and he sent me out here to gather bogbean leaves.  I guess he thinks they're tasty. Anyway, while looking for a bogbean plant. . . I got myself surrounded!  Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for the bogbean? "
3811,Vimes's Report,Bring Vimes's Report to Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore. ,"You've done some good work, <name>, best I've seen from an amateur. Lady Proudmoore asked that I keep her apprised of this delicate situation, and I haven't spoken to her for some time now. I was going to deliver my report to her later, but it seems more fitting that you should be the one to speak with her about it. You can probably answer her questions better than I could. "
3812,Return to Krog,Speak with Krog at Brackenwall Village. ,"I hope I've been helpful to you and I'm sorry I can't offer more information. My apprentices and I produce such a large volume of arms and armor that it's almost impossible to recall details about any individual piece. Not only do we outfit the braves defending tauren lands, but the Grimtotems have a particular fondness for my work. A seasoned warrior knows good work when he sees it. "
3813,Stinky's Escape,"Escort ""Stinky"" Ignatz, then speak with Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet. ","Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me! ! I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>. A goblin from Ratchet named Mebok Mizzyrix needs some bogbean leaves for a potion, or something. . . I honestly don't care why -- his money was good and I know this swamp, so here I am. Too bad I got myself surrounded before I found the bogbean!  Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for Mebok's plant? "
3814,A Final Blow,"Kill Moora and Salia, and bring Shadow Lord Fel'dan's Head to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood. ","Unfortunately, I see the only way to stop this threat to Felwood is a frontal attack. There are no other ways into Shadow Hold, and I have no means to teleport you inside. The straight path down to the bottom is the only way. . . and I also know who you should seek out. His name is Fel'dan. . . Shadow Lord Fel'dan. He is the mortal in power down below. . . he is the head of the serpent. Kill him and his two succubus servants and return to me. Fel'dan is the one making pacts with the Legion. He must be stopped. "
3815,A Strange Red Key,Search through Jaedenar to discover what the Blood Red Key is used for. ,"The small red key seems to be made of some kind of bone material. It is heavy in your hand, but appears very fragile. Why would a member of the Shadow Council have such a thing? Perhaps there is something within Jaedenar that this strange key unlocks. "
3816,Cleansing Felwood,Bring 15 Blood Amber to Arathandris Silversky in Felwood. ,"Plants give life to Felwood, yet even they suffer the taint of corruption.  I know ways to cleanse them, but I cannot give out such knowledge to those I don't know or trust.  Prove to me that you will truly aid the cause of the Cenarion Circle! To the north lie the Irontree Caverns.  The Warpwood elementals present there are now beyond hope of cleansing.  I ask you to bring me their sap - blood amber it is called - so I may study it in the hopes of saving other forms of life here. "
3817,Ancient Spirit,"Escort Arei to safety, then speak with Kayneth Stillwind in Forest Song, in eastern Ashenvale. ","Felwood was once a peaceful and serene land. . . Until the legion took hold. The infernals, destruction, chaos. . . The skull of Gul'dan ensured that none were spared here. All fell to the corruption. Even now, as a spirit, I still find myself trapped, bearing the suffering of this land. Help me find my way home. Please, <name>, tell me you will lead an ancient spirit away from here, where I may finally rest. Once I am free, seek out Kayneth Stillwind, a druid that resides in Forest Song, to the east. "
3818,Feathers for Nafien,"While you have proven yourself to me, you may need to continue to work toward proving yourself to the suspicious brethren of my tribe. ","Well done, <name>!  I will make sure that your deeds are known amongst my kind. Remember to bring any of the feathers you find to me.  I will continue to accept them as long as necessary. "
3819,Corrupted Songflower,"You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a songflower plant. ","You apply some Cenarion plant salve to the songflower.  It immediately begins to shed its corrupted form, blossoming into a vibrant and healthy plant. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(3363))"
3820,Salve via Hunting,Possessing a Cenarion beacon allows one to see a corrupted soul shard on those tainted beasts that are put down for the greater good. ,"Very well then, here are your Cenarion plant salves.  Scour Felwood for corrupted plants, <name>!  Wherever they are, use the salve I have given you to purify them. "
3821,Well of Corruption,Collect a sample of corrupted water from the Jadefire Satyrs' moonwell and bring it to Winna Hazzard at Bloodvenom Post. ,"Some may say that I am exceptionally cruel. . . But truly, it is only a strong desire to see the Horde gain an advantage against the Alliance, in any way possible. My newest interest is a moonwell at the Ruins of Constellas, south of here, tended by the Jadefire satyrs. The moonwell, once a symbol of renewal for the insufferable night elves, is now corrupted, and used to bring forth more satyrs. I have an idea, <name>, and I'd like a sample of the water. . . for my little feline friend here. "
3822,Salve via Gathering,A Cenarion beacon allows a seasoned herbalist to spot insidious fel creep - a malfeasant product of Felwood's corruption. ,"Excellent work <name> - every bit of this, once we purify it, will help us take back Felwood.  Here, take some doses of Cenarion plant salve and head into the forest.  The reclaiming of the land from the corruption waits for no <race>! "
3823,Corrupted Songflower,"You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a songflower plant.

3824,Collection of the Corrupt Water,Take the Empty Canteen to the Moon Well in the center of Jaedenar and fill it before returning to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood. ,"Deep within Jaedenar lies Shadow Hold--the main fortress of their corruption and evil. The Shadow Council has protective spells surrounding their lair in the form of braziers. If I am to find out any more information about our enemy through scrying, then those braziers must be extinguished. By doing so, I should be able to spy on the Council and find out who leads them. If you can, take this canteen and fill it at the Moon Well in the center of Jaedenar. Return to me afterwards. "
3825,Dousing the Flames of Protection,"Using the Purified Moon Well Water, douse the flames of the four braziers of protection within Shadow Hold in Felwood, then return to Greta Mosshoof in the Emerald Sanctuary. ","Now, you must return to Jaedenar. The braziers are more than likely spread throughout Shadow Hold. Douse each of their flames and the protections the Council has set up will fall for at least a short period of time. I will be waiting for that to happen. When it does, I will look deep within the Hold and try to find out who the head of this beast is. Then, and only then, will we see about attacking them directly. "
3826,Forces of Jaedenar,"Enter Jaedenar and slay 4 Jaedenar Hounds, 4 Jaedenar Guardsmen, 6 Jaedenar Adepts, and 6 Jaedenar Cultists before returning to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood. ","If I am to trust you in this matter, you will first have to prove yourself. I must know that you are an enemy of the Shadow Council--the ones responsible for many evils here and abroad. Travel deeper into Felwood. To the west you will see a path leading to Jaedenar. It is there that the Council plots with the Burning Legion. Enter the depths of one of the corrupted Barrow Dens they inhabit and slay their kind. Return to me after you've done this. Then I will know you truly seek to help us. "
3827,Feathers for Grazle,"While you have proven yourself to me, you may need to continue to work toward proving yourself to the suspicious brethren of my tribe. ","Well done, <name>!  I will make sure that your deeds are known amongst my kind. Remember to bring any of the feathers you find to me.  I will continue to accept them as long as necessary. "
3828,Salve via Hunting,Possessing a Cenarion beacon allows one to see a corrupted soul shard on those tainted beasts that are put down for the greater good. ,"Very well then, here are your Cenarion plant salves.  Scour Felwood for corrupted plants, <name>!  Wherever they are, use the salve I have given you to purify them. "
3829,Corrupted Sabers,"Take Winna's kitten to the corrupted moonwell, release it, then bring it back to Winna. ","This corrupted water can be used to our advantage, <name>. With just a small amount of the water, my kitten doubled in size, and seems to be stronger. . . somehow. These cats may prove useful. . . Here, <name>. Take this cat carrier, and release the kitten inside next to the moonwell in the Ruins of Constellas. Heh, heh. . . I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results! Return the cat to me, and I'm sure I can make it worth your time. "
3830,Further Corruption,"Eridan Bluewind in Felwood wants you to kill 8 Jadefire Hellcallers, 8 Jadefire Betrayers, 8 Jadefire Tricksters, and Xavaric. ","A second encampment of satyrs threatens the land of Felwood towards the north, led by the cruel Xavaric. The vile betrayers and tricksters feed upon the corruption of the native creatures of Felwood. Xavathras and his minions were only part of a larger plan -- to cultivate a corrupted moonwell, and then provide the spoils to Xavaric. Now that Xavathras is out of the way, finish this task, <name>. Head to the north and defeat Xavaric. "
3831,Seeking Spiritual Aid,Take the Corrupt Moon Well Water to Islen Waterseer in the Barrens. ,"Take the corrupt water to the Barrens, <name>. South of Ratchet, hidden along the shore, is an old friend of mine, a shaman named Islen Waterseer. She is a powerful shaman who will help us. Her relationship with the spirits of water has always been strong. Our task being a noble one should be enough to persuade her and the spirits of water to aid us in this task. You should find her at a small camp right along the water's edge. And, <name>, ignore the pirates. . . they are but a nuisance and no threat to you. "
3832,Retribution of the Light,Return to Jaedenar and kill the succubus Rakaiah before finding the Remains of Trey Lightforge. ,"She would like to pretend that she's fine. She'd love for me to think that she's strong enough to deal with all of this on her own, but I know better than that. Trey's death and hearing the torture he was put through is going to haunt her for a long time, and there's nothing we can do to stop that. But we can give her some peace! <name>, return to Shadow Hold, kill Trey's torturer and find his remains. There is no reason we can't tie off all these loose ends while Arko'narin mourns in her own private way. "
3833,To Winterspring! ,Find Starfall Village in Winterspring and speak with Wynd Nightchaser. ,"In Winterspring, to the north of here, there are many ancient elven ruins. It's a harsh land, but it holds many secrets and places to explore. With all my work to do here in Felwood, I have not had the opportunity to travel to Winterspring. But there's no reason why you shouldn't! While you're there, look for Wynd Nightchaser. He spends most of his time in Starfall Village and he knows a lot about the area. "
3834,Deadwood Ritual Totem,Take the Deadwood Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item. ,"You have found one of the Deadwood furbolg's ritual totems.  The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but a palpable sense of despair emanates from it.  If there were any object that might best exemplify the corruption that the Deadwood furbolg suffer under, this item would clearly be it. One of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item. . . that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you. "
3835,Salve via Skinning,A Cenarion beacon will allow a well-trained skinner to spot patches of tainted skin from bounty gathered in Felwood. ,"This is exactly what I need.  Here - take these plant salves and use them to reclaim Felwood from the corruption.  We must persevere, <name>! "
3836,Beads for Salfa,"You've certainly earned my trust, &lt; name&gt; , but you may need to continue to earn the trust of my untrusting tribe. ","Once again, you prove your honor to us!  I will make sure that your deeds are known amongst my kind. Remember to bring any of the Winterfall's beads you find to me.  For each set you continue to bring to me, I will speak on your behalf to the tribe. "
3837,Rescue From Jaedenar,"Escort Arko'narin to where Lightforge and her equipment are being held, and then protect her as you escape Shadow Hold. ","But, as much as it pains me, there is one thing that must be done first: I have to find Trey's sword Lightforge and escape Shadow Hold to tell my superiors what's happening here. Can you help me, <name>? Our equipment isn't far from here, and you've already proven you can survive the path to the top. After we escape, I'll head to Darnassus if you can find my friend Jessir near the Ashenvale border. She was to meet us at the Emerald Circle's camp near there. What do you say, <name>? Can you help me again? "
3838,Wild Guardians,Trull Failbane in Felwood wants you to hunt 13 Moontouched Owlbeasts. ,"In the northern areas of Winterspring, the Wildkin grow even more ferocious. We must continue our measures there. Hunt the moontouched owlbeasts in Winterspring, and explore the area they inhabit. This is dangerous ground, but I know that you will be able to handle the challenge. Return to me after you have slain 13 of the wildkin. "
3839,Purified! ,Speak to Eridan again in a moment. ,"Using the water of Elune, I will attempt to purify the flute. We must end this suffering. . . May Elune guide my hands and heart. Speak with me again in a moment. "
3840,Corrupted Windblossom,"You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a windblossom plant. ","You apply two Cenarion plant salves to the windblossom.  It immediately begins to shed its corrupted form, blossoming into a vibrant and healthy plant.

3841,Cleansed Water Returns to Felwood,Take the Purified Moon Well Water to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood. ,"Thank the spirits, <name>. They are the ones that have come to your aid, not me. I give this purified water to you now. Please give my regards to Greta and my best wishes. She is tackling something greater than many of us. . . as I'm sure she will soon find out. The Shadow Council is not a force to be trifled with, <name>. Remember that. Go now. Take the water and return to Greta. "
3842,Speak to Nafien,Travel north along the main road in Felwood and speak with the furbolg named Nafien. ,"Perhaps you are capable of handling a larger threat that we Timbermaw face.  You certainly have shown yourself capable here. . . Another of my kind stands guard outside the entrance to Timbermaw Hold, along this road far to the north.  His name is Nafien; while he may appear to be a feral and unsavory beast, fear him not.  He only seeks aid against the malign forces that threaten our home. "
3843,Cleansing Felwood,Bring 15 Blood Amber to Maybess Riverbreeze in Felwood. ,"Plants give life to Felwood, yet even they suffer the taint of corruption.  I know ways to cleanse them, but I cannot give out such knowledge to those I don't know or trust.  Prove to me that you will truly aid the cause of the Cenarion Circle! To the north lie the Irontree Caverns.  The Warpwood elementals present there are now beyond hope of cleansing.  I ask you to bring me their sap - blood amber it is called - so I may study it in the hopes of saving other forms of life here. "
3844,Salve via Hunting,Possessing a Cenarion beacon allows one to see a corrupted soul shard on those tainted beasts that are put down for the greater good. ,"Very well then, here are your Cenarion plant salves.  Scour Felwood for corrupted plants, <name>!  Wherever they are, use the salve I have given you to purify them.

3848,Felbound Ancients,Travel to Darnassus and use Eridan's Vial to collect a Vial of Blessed Water from the Temple of the Moon. ,"The flute you found was carved from an ancient protector, the treant allies that have faithfully protected the night elves. The satyrs have been able to corrupt anything they come in contact with, which includes the ancients that made Felwood their home. By the use of the fel, the spirit of the ancient has been bound and tortured, never completely released. The felbind you found is no doubt related. We must try to purify the flute, <name>. Bring me blessed water from the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus. "
3849,The Corruption of the Jadefire,"Kill 11 Jadefire Felsworns, 9 Jadefire Shadowstalkers, 9 Jadefire Rogues, and Xavathras. ","Not many seek adventure here. . . Felwood 's corruption is widespread and indiscriminate. As part of the Emerald Circle, I seek to heal this land, but there are some that wish it to fester. The ones I speak of are the Jadefire satyrs that dwell to the northwest of here, at the Ruins of Constellas. Led by a particularly cruel satyr named Xavathras, they continue to spread the disease to any creatures they encounter. We must defend this land that was once ours. Defeat Xavathras and destroy his minions. "
3850,The Remains of Trey Lightforge,Return the Remains of Trey Lightforge to Jessir Moonbow in Felwood. ,You pick up the sack carefully and prepare to make your way back to Jessir Moonbow on the border of Felwood and Ashenvale. Hopefully the paladin will be given the proper respects once you've passed his remains on to his friends. 
3851,Flute of Xavaric,Bring the Flute of Xavaric and 5 Jadefire Felbind samples to Eridan Bluewind in southern Felwood. ,"You study the simple wooden flute you picked up after defeating Xavaric. The knotted wood feels solid, but it seems as if the spirals and patterns in the surface begin to spin and move as you turn it over in your hands. Suddenly, you feel a sense of dread. . . You shake your head, sure that your mind is playing tricks on you. It's possible that other satyrs carry clues as to what you have found. Bring your findings to the druid, Eridan Bluewind, that lives in southern Felwood. "
3852,A Husband's Last Battle,Kill Overlord Ror and return his claw to Dreka'Sur at Bloodvenom Post in Felwood. ,"My husband traveled Felwood for the honor of our clan, doing battle against the Shadow Council and other corrupt atrocities! After he escaped death numerous times, I received a letter from him saying that a druid asked him for help against a great befouled furbolg named Overlord Ror--the two were never heard from again. I want this Ror's clawed hand, <name>. I want it to pay for leaving me a widow! I believe the creature is to the south. . . near the Ashenvale border. "

3860,Wild Guardians,Trull Failbane in Felwood wants you to hunt 10 Berserk Owlbeasts in Winterspring. ,"Runners have returned from Winterspring with reports that there is a series of small caves in the southern area of Winterspring. It seems that there are wildkin situated in the area around these caves. If there is something valuable that they are guarding, I believe that this is the place we will find it. You will find these to be more of a challenge than the previous types, <name>. The creatures seem to have gone mad from exposure to the very thing that they strive to protect. "
3861,Speak to Salfa,Travel through Timbermaw Hold and exit into Winterspring. ,"The threat of corruption comes not only from the Deadwood furbolgs to the south, but also from the east and the Winterfall furbolgs of Winterspring.  If you wish to further aid us, speak with Salfa on the other side of the Hold, by the Winterspring entrance.  Follow the path to the left to reach it. Be warned - if my kind inside considers you hostile or hated, they will attack.  Travel as quick as you can, avoiding conflict.  To kill a Timbermaw - even in self defense - will only alienate you further. "
3862,Wild Guardians,Trull Failbane in Felwood wants you to kill 15 Raging Owlbeasts and 15 Ragged Owlbeasts. ,"Winterspring lies just beyond Timbermaw, northeast of Felwood. Have you been there? I have heard that the area is laden with creatures called wildkin. These beasts have been known to guard secrets; secrets of the Night elves. We must figure out what may be hidden in Winterspring. I have heard the ragged owlbeasts can be found just south of the road, and that there are others called raging owlbeasts that may be found in the center of Winterspring. Clear them out, and gain access to the land. "

3870,Verifying the Corruption,Seek out and destroy 2 Entropic Beasts and 2 Entropic Horrors while exploring Shatter Scar Vale. ,"To the north, along the east of the road in what's called Shatter Scar Vale, is an area where infernals were called down during the last great war--the craters still scar the land, as do the infernals themselves. I am curious about two things. First, are there still entropic elementals roaming the area? And second, are the craters still filled with the corrupt, fetid water that gathered there years ago? Will you help me and check, <name>? Be careful though, the infernals destroy anything in their path. "
3871,Timbermaw Ally,"Grazle wants you to prove yourself by killing 5 Deadwood Warriors, 5 Deadwood Pathfinders, and 5 Deadwood Gardeners. ","The Timbermaw are the only furbolg tribe to escape the corruption. However, many other races kill furbolg blindly now, without bothering to see if they are friend or foe.

3900,The Sunken Temple,Find Marvon Rivetseeker in Tanaris. ,"I have heard of a place that lies deep below the surface of the earth -- banished there by powers greater than I have ever seen. If you wish to learn more of this place; the Sunken Temple, seek out a goblin named Marvon Rivetseeker. Much like Troyas and I, he has studied many ancient areas of the world. He was last known to have left his home in Ratchet to study the troll ruins in Tanaris. Good luck finding him; he hasn't been heard from in some time. "
3901,Weapons of Spirit,Witch Doctor Uzer'i wants you to wait for a moment while he prepares the weapons. ,"Imbuing the muisek into the weapons is a difficult process. Now that I have all of the required materials and the muisek of the creatures that you captured, I may begin. Please wait; I will return in a moment. "
3902,The Super Snapper FX,"Use the Super Snapper FX to take a snapshot of Gammerita, then return to Daryn Lightwind in Rut'theran Village. ","Have the first look at my new invention, <name>. All you need to do is target whatever it is you'd like to take a picture of, and push the button. What was that creature from the Hinterlands that you mentioned? Gammerita? Well, good luck finding her. I'm sure Daryn will be quite pleased with the snapshot you return to her. In any case, here's the Super Snapper. Have fun! "
3903,The Stave of Equinex,Energize Troyas' Stave and find the Equinex Monolith. ,"This stave might be the Stave of Equinex! The Stave of Equinex is actually a key, used to unlock the Equinex Monolith in the Ruins of Ravenwind, on the mainland west of the Dream Bough. Find the four flames that still burn in those ruins: Samha, Imbel, Byltan, and Lahassa. Retrieve their essence and then while standing by the Equinex Monolith, use the essences to energize the stave. If this is truly is the Stave of Equinex, you will be able to unlock the Monolith and gather a sacred artifact from it. "
3904,Natural Materials,"Bring 2 Splintered Logs, 6 Encrusted Minerals, 20 pieces of Resilient Sinew, and 40 Metallic Fragments to Witch Doctor Uzer'i in Camp Mojache. ","I will need certain materials to complete my endeavor. . . You may do this alongside the other tasks I will give you. I'll need a splintered log from a treant of Feralas. Encrusted minerals, these can be found on the mountain giants and faerie dragons to the west. Also, find me some resilient sinew from the owlbeasts of the Hinterlands or hippogryphs of Feralas. Finally, I'll need a large amount of metallic fragments from any of these creatures I mentioned. "
3905,Freedom for All Creatures,"Using the Bamboo Cage Key, free the Sprite Darters from the pen in the Grimtotem camp. ","The filthy Grimtotem clan are capturing faerie dragons, <name>. Jer'kai and I have no idea what they plan on doing with them, but they're obviously up to no good. We're not powerful enough to fight our way into the camp and free the captured dragons, but perhaps with your help. . . If you're willing, and you have some strong friends, release the creatures from their cage with this key and make sure they escape with their lives. I'll be by your side the entire time. Jer'kai will remain here. "

3908,Zapped Giants,Use Zorbin's Ultra-Shrinker to zap any kind of giant found in Feralas into a more manageable form. ,"I'm going to have to do something about the giants if I stay out here!  They're certainly not good for business, now are they? I've been working on a variant of a gnomish shrinking ray, but I'm using superior GOBLIN technological advances in its construction!  In an effort to avoid inconveniences for myself such as death, I'd like for you to try it out on any of the giants in Feralas.  You should find miniaturization residue on them after you shrink them - bring me back some! "
3909,The Gordunni Scroll,Bring the Gordunni Scroll to Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache. ,"Picking up the soiled scroll, you notice that it seems to be depicting some sort of meeting or ceremony. Rok Orhan would be interested in this scroll, and what it might mean to the Gordunni. "
3910,The Giant Guardian,Locate the lost night elf girl. ,"I am no good, <name>. I was 'spose to be watchin' over my little friend, Shay, and somehow, she got away from me. I'm not all that sure what happened, really, but last time I saw her, we was walkin' through the ruins just north of here. Everythin' was goin' fine, but then I turned around, and. . . she was gone. Now I jus can't quite figure out what I should do here. Got any ideas, <name>? I'm awful worried. Hey, how 'bout you go look fer Shay? Yer legs can travel much faster 'n mine. "
3911,Dark Ceremony,Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache wants you to find a Gordunni Orb. ,"These seem to be plans for some sort of dark ceremony, <name>. From what I can make out, this ritual is conducted by the Gordunni mage-lords. Find one of these mage-lords, and from him, gather an orb. The orb of a mage contains great power, and will help us discover more about this ceremony and the magic that the Gordunni wield. "
3912,A Grim Discovery,Bring the Crate of Grimtotem Horns to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar. ,"What? ! Ah, so I did mention a bounty, didn't I? Well, that'll teach me to open my mouth, won't it? You did the work, so I suppose it is only right you reap the greatest reward from it. Take the horns, I'll have them put in a crate for you. Find Belgrom Rockmaul in the Valley of Honor, he'll want to know what you saw and he'll reward you for your hard work. Be well, <class>, and thank you again for everything you've done. "
3913,Dark Heart,Talo Thornhoof in Camp Mojache wants Edana Hatetalon's Dark Heart. ,"Edana Hatetalon is the queen of the Northspring harpies that reside in the ruins to the west. She is pure evil; I have heard that her heart is one of crystal. She is void of any emotion aside from the hate she feels towards all others. You must face Edana and bring me back her dark heart. I have heard of a horn that harpies carry -- blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon the queen. Imagine her surprise when it is not her kin calling her, but her death. "
3914,An Orphan Looking For a Home,Speak to Quentin in Thousand Needles. ,"Oh, hello, <name>. I'm so glad to see you again. How was your trip to Darnassus? Well, you'll be happy to know that we've made quite a bit of progress while you've been gone. We even saved a nest full of eggs. Unfortunately, the mother died before we got to her. Say, would you want one for a pet? They look to hatch soon, so they'll need a good <father/mother>. What do you say? If you're really interested, take one of the eggs to Quentin at the race tracks in Shimmering Flats. He'll tell you more. "
3915,Find OOX-22/FE! ,Take the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot in a cave near Feral Scar Vale. ,"You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life. ""My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed!  I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot! """"I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it is in a cave near Feral Scar Vale! """
3916,Wandering Shay,Pick up Shay's Bell from the chest. ,"Do you think you could help me find my way back to my friend, Rockbiter? He was supposed to be watching me. . . But I do have a tendency to wander off now and then. There are just so many things to see, and I get so distracted. There is one thing that will always work to get my attention, though. Inside this chest, you'll find a bell that is very precious to me. I just love the sound of it. You have my word, if I wander off, all you have to do is ring it and I'll come running back. "
3917,The Newest Member of the Family,"Take your Fragile Sprite Darter Egg to the Hinterlands and speak to Agnar Beastamer, but hurry, you only have 1 hour to find him before the hatchling within the egg dies. ","A magnificent specimen, <name>. If this creature survives gestation, then it'll be a healthy pet indeed! There is one last thing I would suggest doing if you plan on following through with this--head to Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands. Speak to a dwarf there named Agnar Beastamer, he's a master animal handler and should be able to guide you in the final steps of incubation. But hurry, <name>, this egg is fragile and will not last long without proper care. "
3918,Doling Justice,Take Jer'kai's Signet Ring to High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind in Darnassus. ,"Out here in the wilderness, Kindal and I have meager means to reward your help, but we don't want you to feel unappreciated. Take my signet ring. If you ever find yourself in the boughs of Teldrassil, go to the Temple of the Moon in the heart of Darnassus. There you will find my High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind. The ring will let her know that we are well and give credit to your story. We both thank you, <name>. "
3919,Mountain Giant Muisek,Kill 7 Land Walkers or Cliff Giants. ,"The last task I will require of you is to travel to the northwest and find the final enemy. The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the burning legion appeared in the world. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain. I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek. "
3920,Stinglasher,"Defeat Stinglasher in the Writhing Deep, bringing its glands back to Hadoken Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas. ","In surveying the Writhing Deep, one of our scouts reported seeing a giant insect - much larger than the other insects spotted - wandering about the twisted terrain.  Not only is it larger, it also seems to secrete some sort of aura that the other insects don't.  We've given it a name - Stinglasher. The innards of this beast would be invaluable to study as we figure out the best way to deal with this new threat.  Cut out its secretion glands and bring it back to me immediately! "
3921,Rescue OOX-22/FE! ,"Escort OOX-22/FE to safety, then report to Oglethorpe Obnoticus in Booty Bay. ","The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot: ""I need to move OOX-22/FE to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure.  It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again.  Escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, the main road!  That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things online! """"Escort it safely and then come talk to me in Booty Bay! Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out! """
3922,Testing the Vessel,"Kill 10 Ironfur Bears or Longtooth Runners, and use the Beast Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen beasts. ","This will be a test; both of the ritual I performed, and of your abilities. Take this vessel, <name>. With it, you will have the power to shrink and capture a creature inside of it. Travel to the wilderness east of here and look for beasts. The vicious, ironfur bears and longtooth runners are your targets, <name>. Kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them before their spirits can escape. "
3923,Treant Muisek,Kill 3 Wandering Forest Walkers. ,"The wandering forest walkers that can be found meandering through the forest are our next target, <name>. Night elves have enlisted treants as allies to fight against the horde. Their movement may be slow, but their role as protectors is undeniable. Soon we will be able to use this power for our own benefit. Find 3 wandering forest walkers; kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them. "
3924,Alpha Strike,Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas and return to Hadoken Swiftstrider within one hour. ,"The plan is for various leaders of the gnolls - Alphas as they call themselves - to be taken down within rapid succession.  If we're able to execute this sort of swift and precise devastation against them, it would cause chaos in their ranks.  Perhaps it would also drive a message through their thick flea-bitten heads that we can and will destroy them! I want you to be the messenger of my will; eliminate five of their Alphas within one hour for this to work <name>, or we'll remain at this impasse! "
3925,Psychometric Reading,Speak with Ginro Hearthkindle in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"I'm a little wobbly still, sorry.  Anyway, I received some useful visions. Raschal takes two large leather backpacks from his boat and goes inland; he returns to the boat, however.  I see gnoll scalps. . . he ran into some gnolls - Woodpaw I think they're called.  He's very worried - almost terrified - about something.  So much so, that he is not paying attention to water elementals forming behind him.  The images. . . stop there. I need to rest, sorry <name>.  Tell Gin what I've seen.  He needs to know. "
3926,The Mark of Quality,Bring 10 Thick Yeti Hides to Jangdor Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache. ,"I take pride in my leather work, and I feel it shows; quality should never be compromised.  Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter would also have you believe that the earth does not keep secrets! In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have discovered thick yeti hides.  Yetis are native to Feralas, often found west of here in Feral Scar Vale.  I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that is agreeable to you, then we are set! "
3927,A Short Incubation,Bring 2 Elixir of Fortitudes to Quentin in Thousand Needles. ,"The Moonweavers, huh? Most intriguing. I wish the sprite darters could truly appreciate what it means to have those two look after them. They are both quite capable. So, they gave you the egg as a gift. Well, then you should be responsible for it for as long as you desire. It appears it's almost ready to hatch, but we should ensure it's healthy and no damage has been done to it. I only need two elixirs of fortitude for a small spell to protect the egg. I have the rest of the components here with me. "
3928,The Missing Courier,Speak with Ginro Hearthkindle in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"An associate of mine, Ginro Hearthkindle, is looking for assistance concerning the location of a courier and the parcels he was carrying.  It has been a week or so since the courier went missing; our own searches have proved fruitless, and we're at an impasse.  Unfortunately, I have had to declare the courier as missing in action. If you have the time and resources to spare, please speak with Ginro.  He should be here in the Stronghold - perhaps in his quarters. "
3929,The Writhing Deep,"Now that Raschal's last known whereabouts have been discovered, continue your search for him or his remains in the Writhing Deep. ","Inside the backpacks are two items: the first is a parcel of goods that was bound for Thalanaar, and the second is a note hastily penned to an unknown reader. The note tells of discovering insidious bug-like creatures south of the gnoll camps in a place called the Writhing Deep.  The author felt the need to investigate it personally, as though it was a serious threat to all of Feralas.  The note is signed, ""Raschal of Feathermoon"". It would seem that you have located where Raschal ultimately went. "
3930,Improved Quality,"Bring 10 Rage Scar Yeti Hides to Jangdor Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas. ","I have a lead on an even BETTER source of hides, if that's even possible to believe!  In the northern parts of Feralas - deep within Rage Scar Hold - are another throng of yetis.  They're much tougher than the ones you dealt with before, so if you're up for a bigger challenge you'd best be on your toes! I would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business. "
3931,Doling Justice,"Kill 12 Grimtotem Naturalists, 10 Grimtotem Raiders, and 6 Grimtotem Shamans before returning to Jer'kai Moonweaver in Feralas. ","As she's already told you, Kindal and I will now take the fight to the Grimtotem. Together, we should still be able to pick off some of the tauren without much threat to ourselves, but we'd love some help if you're willing and able. You've seen the camp below us, but there are more to the east. Using your own tactics, deal as much damage to the tauren as you can. We can all meet back here after they've felt the sting of Kindal's arrows and your own weapons. "
3932,The Mark of Quality,Bring 10 Thick Yeti Hides to Pratt McGrubben in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises.  Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in Dun Morogh! In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides.  The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Feral Scar Vale.  I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that sounds fair to you, then we're in business. "
3933,The Strength of Corruption,Talo Thornhoof at Camp Mojache in Feralas wants you to kill 12 Angerclaw Grizzlies and 12 Felpaw Ravagers in Felwood. ,"Being a hunter, I strive to emulate the strengths I see in my opponents. It is possible to turn the battle in your favor by simply knowing your enemy well, <name>. In a place called Felwood, north of Ashenvale, the creatures have been tainted by a substance called fel. The bears and wolves have been driven mad by it, but I believe that they have also grown even stronger as well. Go, <name>. Travel to Felwood and face these beasts. Learn for yourself if they are truly as strong as I believe. "
3934,Return to Troyas,Deliver the book to Troyas Moonbreeze in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"Here it is, <name>. Please, take care of my book. Now, hurry along. I'm sure Troyas is eager for your return. "
3935,The Morrow Stone,Return the Sparkling Stone and the Stave of Equinex to Troyas Moonbreeze in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"The moment the artifact is removed from the Monolith, you feel the energy in the Stave of Equinex begin to fade. "
3936,The Woodpaw Gnolls,Search the Woodpaw Gnoll camps of southern Feralas for evidence of the courier's belongings or the courier himself. ,"Our ""friends"" the Woodpaw might have gotten Raschal in the end, but something tells me that's not what occurred.  Still, they're the best place to start looking. I wish I had clearer insight as to what to do, but all I have right now is 'Search the Woodpaw camps - go. '  I do know that gnolls will keep items they scavenge and fight over them; maybe they ran across the backpacks Quint mentioned.  I hadn't risked a head-on fight in past searches, but with Quint's vision on this I say rip into them. "
3937,Refuel for the Zapping,"Collect 6 Water Elemental Cores from the Sea Elementals and Sea Sprays along the Forgotten Coast of Feralas, and bring them back to Zorbin Fandazzle who is near the dock there. ","More work, you say?  Did my heroic mission of collecting bits of goo found inside elemental beings not slake your thirst for adventure?  Perhaps more of the same will vainly try to fill the bottomless well of questing you possess. . . OK, melodrama aside, I do need more water elemental cores.  I'm trying desperately to set up shop here, so the rewards won't be as great. . . but I promise you I'll tell everyone in earshot how you've helped me.  Trust me on this - I know people in the Cartel! "
3938,Gordunni Cobalt,Orwin Gizzmick in Camp Mojache wants 12 samples of Gordunni Cobalt. ,"I just arrived here in Feralas, and I've heard that the Gordunni Ogres that inhabit the wilds here have some interesting minerals. Who knows what they are up to, but they sure are protective of that stuff! They don't leave it just lying around; no, they bury it to protect folks like me from getting their hands on it. If you'd be willing, I'll give you my shovel. Go to the Gordunni Outpost north of here and dig me up some Gordunni cobalt. Look for the blue glow, then start digging! "
3939,The Ogres of Feralas,"Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache wants you to kill 10 Gordunni Ogres, 10 Gordunni Ogre-Magi, and 5 Gordunni Brutes. ","The effects of the Gordunni Ogre tribe can hardly go unnoticed in this area. Look around, <name>; their very presence scars this land. We must push them back before they expand even further into Feralas. Follow the river north, and you will find their outpost. Decrease their numbers, <name>. We must show them that their kind is not wanted here. "
3940,The Gordunni Orb,Bring the Gordunni Orb to Uthel'nay in the Darkbriar Lodge in Orgrimmar. ,"Although I know my enemy well, I am a warrior, <name>. I cannot begin to tell you what this orb is capable of. I know of a mage in Orgrimmar that will be able to tell us more about the orb. Take it to him. "
3941,Again With the Zapped Giants,Use Zorbin's Ultra-Shrinker to zap any kind of giant found in Feralas into a more manageable form. ,"I know you've gathered residue for me already. . . but should you find yourself for want of an encore performance to a fun-time activity, I can always use more residue. While I can't offer nearly as much in the way of compensation again, I'll be more than happy to spread the good word of your service to all my goblin friends with ears. Believe me <sir/madam> when I say that these goblins have quite large ears. "
3942,Delivering the Relic,Deliver the Mysterious Relic to Vestia Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"If you would be so kind as to deliver the relic to my wife Vestia, I would appreciate it.  She's not only a fine priestess for our community, but she is one of the most well-versed scholars you'll find anywhere.  I couldn't make heads or tails of this device even if there was a wager involved.  My wife though, if anyone can figure out what this thing is, she could. . . and we need to know! She's just around the bend, no doubt studying.  Thanks, <name>. "
3943,Zukk'ash Report,Deliver the Camp Mojache Zukk'ash Report to Zilzibin Drumlore. ,"You've done doubly well in addressing the threat that the Zukk'ash insects pose to Camp Mojache.  The threat these things pose is far from over, and I'd like to ask you for one last task on behalf of the Horde. This is a document that details all the information we have learned about these Zukk'ash insects.  I want you to deliver it to Zilzibin Drumlore in the Drag of Orgrimmar.  He's an expert on alien creatures like these; I hope he can do something with the lore we've obtained. "
3944,Rise of the Silithid,Bring Raschal's Report to Gracina Spiritmight in Darnassus. ,"I am entrusting you with a copy of the report Raschal made on the infestation of southeastern Feralas.  While the main report is being filed in Darnassus, I want you to give this copy to an associate of the Protectorate.  Her name is Gracina Spiritmight; she is a priestess who dwells in the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus.  She has broad knowledge on these kinds of creatures, and her receiving this report would benefit us all. You're dismissed - good luck, <name>; may Elune watch over us all. "
3945,Against Lord Shalzaru,"Eliminate Lord Shalzaru, and then bring the Mysterious Relic he uncovered to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold. ","<name>, new scouting reports have given us a good idea on the naga chain of command.  Royalty is present amongst their rank and file, and they're the ones calling all the shots. Specifically, we've identified one of the crueler royals as Lord Shalzaru.  Scouts report that he himself has uncovered an odd relic during a recent naga excavation in a cave south of the main ruins, across the water on the Isle of Dread. Put a stop to it by putting a stop to him, and bring me his relic so we can study it. "
3946,The Borrower,Take the letter to Curgle Cranklehop in Tanaris. ,"I have studied many subjects in my time, and my latest fascination is with the snapjaw that occupy the beach in the Hinterlands. There's one in particular I'd like to see, a giant snapjaw named Gammerita. I'd like to go myself, but my research keeps me here. I think a picture of her would be the next best thing. Take this letter to Curgle Cranklehop in Tanaris. She has created an invention for me that can capture a picture. She called it a ""snapshot, "" I think. . . "
3947,A Strange Request,Take the Shrunken Head to Xerash Fireblade at the Lariss Pavilion in Feralas. ,"Xerash Fireblade, located at the Lariss Pavilion, north of Camp Mojache,  has what I need to get started here! He has mixed up a concoction that I need for my. . . well, you'll see. Off with you now -- to Xerash. Here, take this with you. It's a shrunken head that I promised Xerash in exchange for the herbs. It's the head of some poor dwarf I ventured across in the forest. I'm sure he will be pleased. "
3948,Thalanaar Delivery,Bring the Undelivered Parcel to Falfindel Waywarder in Thalanaar. ,"This parcel of goods you found in the Woodpaw gnoll camps was supposed to be delivered to the small way-station of Thalanaar in southeastern Feralas.  Regardless of the missing courier's fate, the task of delivering the parcel remains unfinished. Examining the parcel in detail reveals a hand written name of "" Falfindel Waywarder "" on the outside of the packaging.  Perhaps this is the parcel's ultimate recipient. "
3949,In Search of Knowledge,Talk to Daryn Lightwind in Rut'theran Village. ,"While the ruins of Feralas can be quite dangerous, they have much to tell of what has happened here. Searching through the rubble to the south a few days ago, I discovered what appears to be a normal stave. However, I just can't shake the feeling that there is something more to it. Angelas and I have been poring over our books here, but we can't find a thing about it. I have a colleague in Darnassus that may be able to tell us what this is, <name>. Why don't you go talk to her and see if she can help us? "
3950,A New Cloak's Sheen,Bring 10 Iridescent Sprite Darter Wings to Krueg Skullsplitter in Camp Mojache. ,"Well met, <class>. I've traveled with my companions down to the Feralas on a mission for our Orgrimmar masters. My life-mate Korrin finds great pleasure in new clothing, so I aim to make her a new cloak adorned with the gossamer wings of faerie dragons. Would you be able to help me? Sprite darters with gorgeous wings I want are west of Camp Mojache. "
3951,Faerie Dragon Muisek,Kill 8 Sprite Darters or Sprite Dragons. ,"<name>, next I must have you capture a creature that in appearance, may look quite fragile, yet its powerful spirit is what we are truly after. The faerie dragons that I speak of have served the night elves as their allies. We must capture one so that the horde may benefit from this strength of spirit as well. Here is the muisek, <name>. Kill 8 sprite darters or sprite dragons, and capture their muisek. They may be found to the west of here. "
3952,Fuel for the Zapping,"Collect 10 Water Elemental Cores from the Sea Elementals and Sea Sprays along the Forgotten Coast of Feralas, and bring them back to Zorbin Fandazzle who is near the dock there. ","If I bet against my own better judgment and stay to run an engineering shop along the Forgotten Coast, I will need to deal with these pesky elementals.  Curse the powers of elementalism unchecked, I say! Fortunately for me, and now for you my hopeful agent provocateur, the elementals represent an ideal source of raw power for my Ultra-Shrinker refinement - give them the what-for I say!  When doing this though, be sure to save me the water elemental cores! "
3953,The Missing Courier,Locate the courier's boat somewhere along the coast of Feralas. ,"It's been about a week since Raschal, the courier, set out for Thalanaar.  He knows Feralas well; he's been with us since General Feathermoon led the expeditionary forces here.  I know his plan was to take a row boat down the coast and try and traverse across southern Feralas to avoid the Horde camp. I couldn't find his boat, but maybe you can.  Maybe it is hidden, or maybe it was sunk.  Regardless, it might hold a clue as to where he is.  If you uncover something, please let me know. "
3954,Improved Quality,"Bring 10 Rage Scar Yeti Hides to Pratt McGrubben at Feathermoon Stronghold, Feralas. ","I have a lead on an even BETTER source of hides, if that's even possible to believe!  In the northern parts of Feralas - deep within Rage Scar Hold - are another throng of yetis.  They're much tougher than the ones you dealt with before, so if you're up for a bigger challenge you'd best be on your toes! I would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business. "
3955,Woodpaw Investigation,Find the gnoll battle plans somewhere in the gnoll camps to the south of Camp Mojache. ,"Gnolls aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, but they will no doubt have some sort of documented strategy on their recent activity.  If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up. I want you to head back to the Woodpaw and find anything that might resemble their battle plans.  They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them.  Find them, and return to me when you have them. "
3956,War on the Woodpaw,Bring 10 Woodpaw Gnoll Manes to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache. ,"The gnolls. . . they are more than a nuisance.  They are a constant threat to the existence of this very camp!  It is irrelevant whether they are indigenous to Feralas or not; if we do not strengthen our resolve against them, we will find ourselves driven out of the entire region. The gnoll attacks against the camp have become more fevered as of late.  We need your aid in thinning their numbers; bring to me ten of their manes, and I will reward you handsomely for your effort. Go! "
3957,Return to Feathermoon Stronghold,Return to Shandris Feathermoon in the Feathermoon Stronghold and report your findings. ,"With the discovery of the strange gazebo in the heart of the Ruins of Solarsal, the time has come to return to Feathermoon Stronghold and report to General Shandris Feathermoon what has been discovered here. "
3958,To the Top,"Would you like to see the view atop one of the twin colossals? I can send you there, &lt; race&gt; . ","Would you like to see the view atop one of the twin colossals? I can send you there, <race>. Do consider how you will get down, though. This is a one way trip only. "
3959,Return to Witch Doctor Uzer'i,Deliver Xerash's Herb Pouch to Witch Doctor Uzer'i in Feralas. ,"Here are the herbs, <name>. Take them to Witch Doctor Uzer'i. Please let him know that I am satisfied with the shrunken head. "
3960,A Hero's Welcome,Speak with Shandris Feathermoon in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"<name>, General Shandris Feathermoon would like to speak with you personally.  No doubt she wants to thank you for your service to the Stronghold, but I do know that she also wants to talk to you about the insect creatures that you and Raschal faced in southern Feralas.  The reports of those Zukk'ash insects are. . . frightening, to say the least. General Feathermoon is waiting for you in the main compound. "
3961,Pristine Yeti Hide,"Bring the Pristine Yeti Hide to Pratt McGrubben at the Feathermoon Stronghold, Feralas. ","You have found a pristine yeti hide that is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar. Considering that Pratt McGrubben at the Feathermoon Stronghold is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him. "
3962,Boat Wreckage,Return to Feathermoon Stronghold and show Ginro Hearthkindle the Discarded Knife you have found. ,"Running your hand along the mud, your fingers graze the handle of a knife.  It looks well cared for, and it might be safe to assume that whoever was on the boat might have lost it.  Perhaps the large chunk of the missing boat might have something to do with the loss. You grab the knife, remembering that Ginro Hearthkindle in the Feathermoon Stronghold instructed you to return to him with any found clues.  You get the feeling, however, that you are not quite alone in the water. . . "
3963,The Ogres of Feralas,"Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache wants you to kill 10 Gordunni Shaman, 10 Gordunni Warlocks, and 5 Gordunni Maulers. ","Now that you have proven that you are a true fighter, I trust that you possess the courage to continue with the task at hand. Travel to the High Wilderness, southwest of here. There lie some abandoned and destroyed structures, on land that once belonged to the night elves. Look for these ruins, and when you see the withered trees and desecrated terrain, you will find the Gordunni. Push them back. These ogres are much stronger than the ones you faced previously, <name>. Be aware. "
3964,Perfect Yeti Hide,"Bring the Perfect Yeti Hide to Jangdor Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas. ","You have found what may very well be a perfect yeti hide.  You easily note that it is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar. Considering that Jangdor Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him. "
3965,The High Wilderness,"Angelas Moonbreeze wants you to kill 8 Gordunni Warlocks, 8 Gordunni Shaman, and 8 Gordunni Brutes. ","Although it is dangerous, Troyas and I have been investigating the ruins that cover the forests of Feralas. Lately, though, Troyas has been going on his own to the High Wilderness, and I really worry about him. The Gordunni Ogres have taken over that area, and they don't take kindly to anyone that enters their territory. I was hoping you might be willing to travel to the ruins to the southeast and clear out some of the ogres. Make it a little safer for my Troyas, and I will be extremely grateful. "
3966,Zukk'ash Infestation,"Bring 20 Zukk'ash Carapaces to Hadoken Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas. ","From what scouting we have managed to muster, we believe that the foe south of the gnolls is an insect-like race.  Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not if they're sentient.  If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls. Drive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.  Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork. "
3967,The Ruins of Solarsal,Explore the Ruins of Solarsal and investigate the presence of the naga there. ,"To our south are the Ruins of Solarsal; this is an area that far pre-dates modern times.  We explored the ruins initially and found nothing of note; as such, we left it in peace. Very recently, the Hatecrest naga have occupied these ruins in alarming numbers.  At first, we considered it as the precursor for an attack.  Though that threat is still possible, we believe there might be something else going on. Go there, explore the ruins, and look for anything that stands out to you. Good luck, <name>. "
3968,The Battle Plans,Bring the Woodpaw Battle Plans to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache. ,"With the battle plans of the gnolls discovered, all that now remains is to bring the plans back to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.  Perhaps he or someone there can make further sense of what the gnolls are up to. "
3969,Food for Baby,Bring 5 Silvermane Stalker Flanks to Agnar Beastamer in Hinterlands. ,"Sprite darters are omnivores--that means they eat both meat and vegetation. If your egg here's gonna hatch, we best be prepared. Some good eats for these little guys are flanks of meat, raw and juicy, believe it or not. I was never able to find out why, but it has somethin' to do with Elune's plan for the elves. . . maybe they were to be protectors or somethin', I don't know. I'll take care of the egg for now, why don't you get me some good Silvermane stalker flanks for 'em to eat when he's hatched. "
3970,Against the Hatecrest,Bring 10 Hatecrest Naga Scales to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"The best course of action at this point is to assume that, regardless of what the naga are up to, they will eventually move to secure the island for their own.  We need to take aggressive steps to counter that threat before it is too late. Bring me ten Hatecrest Scales that are in good condition; it should be obvious to you how to acquire them.  You'll cut your teeth on the naga for the first time, and we'll have a weakened naga presence on Sardor Isle - both are prospects that play to our advantage. "
3971,The Knife Revealed,Take the Discarded Knife to Quintis Jonespyre in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"The Stronghold's resident druid, Quintis Jonespyre, has some. . . unusual skills.  One of them involves psychometry - the ability to reveal an item's history by touch.  Don't ask me how he does it; I chalk it up to magic I do not and choose not to understand.  I do know, however, two things: one, I've seen it work and two, the bum owes me. Take the knife up to Quint in his little tree-house here, and tell him for me that his Kalimdor Hold 'Em debt will be paid if he works his mojo on that knife. "
3972,Freed from the Hive,Free Raschal from the Zukk'ash hive. ,"The pod splits opens some when you touch it, revealing a night elven male who is surprisingly still alive.  He seems to be in good health, though deeply stunned.  As you help him down from the pod, he stirs to life. ""Thank Elune - you've saved me, friend!  I. . . I'm Raschal, and I awoke paralyzed inside this pod after these bugs overwhelmed me.  Were you sent by the Stronghold? ""It would seem that you've found the missing courier! "
3973,Corrupted Songflower,"You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a songflower plant. ","You apply some Cenarion plant salve to the songflower.  It immediately begins to shed its corrupted form, blossoming into a vibrant and healthy plant. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(2878))"
3974,Vengeance on the Northspring,"Talo Thornhoof wants you to kill 4 Northspring Harpies, 4 Northspring Roguefeathers, 4 Northspring Windcallers, and 4 Northspring Slayers. ","In my day, I was a seasoned hunter. There wasn't any creature around that I feared. Until. . . I was out in the forest, sharpening my blade after a tough battle, when I was ambushed. Harpies surrounded me, and I barely managed to drag myself to safety. Even now, I can still hear their cries echoing. . . I was never the same after that. But the hate boils inside of me -- I must get even, after all these years. The Northspring harpies can be found to the west of here. <name>, get my revenge. "
3975,Hippogryph Muisek,"Kill 10 Frayfeather Hippogryphs of any type, then use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture them. ","Since you have proven that you are both trustworthy and gifted with the ability to use the muisek vessel, I now wish you to capture another creature. Hippogryphs have been loyal companions to the night elves for many years; their spirits are loyal and steadfast. Your task is to kill 10 frayfeather hippogryphs, and quickly, shrink and capture them with the vessel, so that their muisek may be preserved. You will find the hippogryphs in the High Wilderness, to the south of here. "
3976,Against the Hatecrest,Report to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold. ,"At this point, I am going to direct you to my second, Latronicus.  He's been keeping a close eye on the naga forces to date.  I'll assess the general situation here in regards to the naga; as much as I want to commit a full force to move against them, leaving the stronghold open to direct attack from the Horde - or worse - seems less than optimal. Anyway, Latronicus awaits.  Good work thus far, <name>.  Keep it up. You're dismissed. "
3977,Feralas: A History,Ask Daryn Lightwind if you may borrow her book. ,"This book looks as if no one has opened it for quite a long time. Its covers are quite worn, and its pages yellowed, but after examining it, you notice that it might be just what Troyas is looking for. You pick it up, but realize you should probably ask before borrowing it. "
3978,A Grim Discovery,Bring 20 Grimtotem Horns to Krueg Skullsplitter in Camp Mojache. ,"What! ? You came across tauren in the area? You're joking! What did they look like! ? The Grimtotem clan! You found some of them? Belgrom, one of our masters, has an interest in their kind. . . he's even put a bounty on them. You have to go back, <class>. Go back and bring me their horns. . . piles of them if you can. The Grimtotem are not to be trifled with or underestimated. Go back and slay them; let the rivers in Feralas run red with their dark blood. "
3979,A Reliquary of Purity,Travel to Silithus and search for a Reliquary of Purity within the ruins of Southwind Village. ,"The first step is to find a container capable of holding an extremely corruptible substance without the handler suffering ill effects.  There is only one sort device I am aware of that could possibly contain something as vile as the Felvine: a Reliquary of Purity. Deep in the wasteland of Silithus is the remnants of the night elf village known as Southwind.  I know one was there many, many years ago.  If we are to succeed, I need you to scour those ruins in the hopes of reclaiming it. "
3980,Shards of the Felvine,Find the Felvine in Dire Maul and acquire a shard from it. ,"Your knowledge of Eldre'Thalas - Dire Maul - in Feralas will now come into play, <name>.  In the eastern part of the ruined city is where Alzzin the Wildshaper has exerted his corrupt dominion.  Go there with all due haste and brave whatever challenges await you. The Fruit of Fertility, now corrupted as the Felvine, should be close to Alzzin.  When he falls, capture whatever essence of the Felvine you can.  Seal it in the Reliquary, and bring it to me. Good luck, and Cenarion's speed. "
3981,The Nightmare's Corruption,Travel to the four Emerald Dream portals in Azeroth and collect a Fragment of the Nightmare's Corruption from each. ,You must travel to the four dream portals of Azeroth. From each you must draw a fragment of the Nightmare's corruption. The dragonkin that inhabit these areas will hold such fragments. Return to me when you have gathered these fragments. 
3982,Wasteland,"Speak with Layo Starstrike near the Valor's Rest graveyard of Silithus, showing him Rabine's Letter. ","West of Un'Goro Crater, via the northwestern ridge, is a harsh wasteland - Silithus.  Few know that an ancient war was waged there between the night elves and a malign, alien power.  The evil was sealed, but now we suspect that forces work to stir this. . . unspeakable horror. Seek out Layo Starstrike, one of our agents in Silithus; look for him at Valor's Rest, the final resting spot for the fallen of the wastes.  Give him this letter, and he will give you his trust accordingly. "
3983,The Nightmare Manifests,Defend Nighthaven from Eranikus. ,We must use restraint against Eranikus. We are to redeem him not destroy him. Tyrande is already en route to assist us in this task. We must weather the dragon's blows and save Nighthaven from certain destruction. Be on guard! You and your allies are our only hope. 
3984,Under the Chitin Was. . . ,"Hey, it's you again! &nbsp; Well, I mean you - as in the you that is &lt; name&gt; ! &nbsp; Yes - that you! Hey, let me start over! That object you found in Silithus - it was in fact a book. ","Hey, it's you again!  Well, I mean you - as in the you that is <name>!  Yes - that you! Hey, let me start over! That object you found in Silithus - it was in fact a book.  It was a journal written in a very ancient dialect of what we now call the Darnassian tongue.  It'll take a while, but I'm going to go over it very thoroughly.  I thought you should know that what you found was extremely valuable for the Circle. The den mother's all excited and everything! "
3985,Uncovering Past Secrets,"Speak with Rabine Saturna in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade. ","Anyway, you should check back with me relatively soon. . . that is if you want to know what was in here.  As soon as I find out what it is, and if it's indeed a book, I'd be happy to share that information with you. In the meantime, I'd check in with the den mother of this little bear camp, Rabine.  No doubt he'll want to know what crazy antics you've been up to.  Never leave the den mother waiting, <name>. . . that is, unless you want to be doused in honey. It's happened, trust me. "
3986,The Champion Returns,Take the Green Scepter Shard to Anachronos at the Caverns of Time in Tanaris. ,"The keeper awaits your return, <name>. Take the green scepter shard to Anachronos at the Caverns of Time. "
3987,Rites of the Earthmother,Cairne Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff wants you to bring him the Horn of Arra'chea. ,"You have passed the Rites of the Earthmother and earned your place in Thunder Bluff. But in order to maintain the spot that you strived so hard to achieve, you must continue to prove your worth to your people. We are hunters, <name>. Down below in Mulgore there is a mighty kodo named Arra'chea. Show me your skills in the ways of tracking and hunting by bringing me the Horn of Arra'chea. "
3988,Dwarven Digging,Collect 5 Prospector's Picks. ,"There are dwarves preparing a dig site to the northwest.  They think secrets lie in the earth, and that is true, but hollowing and defiling the land is no way to earn its teachings. Collect the dwarven tools of digging, smash them, and return to me with the dwarves' broken tools. You can smash the tools at a forge.  You will find one in Thunder Bluff, but any forge -- even a forge at the dwarven camp -- will suffice. "
3989,The Demon Scarred Cloak,Find someone who knows of Ghost Howl. ,"The ragged hide of Ghost Howl still bears a terrible wound, gained from the wolf's battles against the Burning Legion. Perhaps someone in Bloodhoof Village should know of Ghost Howl's demise. . . . "
3990,Rite of Vision,Consume the Water of the Seers in front of the tribal fire in Bloodhoof Village and follow the vision once it appears. ,"I now present you with the Water of the Seers. When you are ready, consume the waters near the tribal fire. Once you have ingested the holy waters, it will take a few moments before the vision materializes before the fire. At that point, it is up to you to follow it to your destiny. . . . "
3991,Kyle's Gone Missing! ,"Ahab Wheathoof at Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore wants you to feed his prized puppy, Kyle the Frenzied. ","Help, <name>! My prized puppy, Kyle, has run away! I just know he's running around Bloodhoof Village, lost and hungry. Will you find him and feed him? Once he eats he will settle down and come home. To feed him you will need to find food. His favorite meal is tender strider meat. Just venture east and you should find plenty of striders. Hunt one down and take its succulent meat to Kyle. When you see Kyle in town, put the meat down and he is sure to come to you. "
3992,The Ravaged Caravan,Morin Cloudstalker wants you to examine the contents of a supply crate at the Ravaged Caravan. ,"A few days ago, we found a Venture Co. caravan traveling under guard on the northern shore of Stonebull Lake. We'd lost two of our number in an earlier battle, so we were quick to attack and lay waste to the caravan. We left their supply crates, thinking that our torches would destroy anything of value, but given that Venture Co. salvagers have been spotted near the burned wagons, maybe we were wrong. Perhaps you could go to the caravan and examine the contents of the crates. "
3993,Supervisor Fizsprocket,Kill Supervisor Fizsprocket and return his clipboard to Morin Cloudstalker at Bloodhoof Village. ,"According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the Venture Co. created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands.

","<name>, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as our elders have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land. Palemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled. Words are no longer the answer. "
3996,Dangers of the Windfury,Bring 8 Windfury Talons to Ruul Eagletalon in Bloodhoof Village. ,"Thank you for taking the time to speak to me, <name>. I am Ruul, warrior and teacher. You have obviously reached an age when you must prepare for your trials if you are to adventure much further out of Mulgore. If you wish a test of your strength, start by seeking out the Windfury harpies to the southeast. They nestle along the mountain's edges away from the road. They are one of our natural enemies here in Mulgore and will be a good gauge of your skill. "
3997,Journey to the Crossroads,Speak with Thork at the Crossroads in the Barrens. ,"I have foreseen your arrival, young <class>. Though perhaps you are not so young anymore. I think that it is time for you to move deeper into this land. I can sense that you are destined for great things. It is the Crossroads that you must seek out, for our lives with the orcs have become intertwined and they need assistance. Continue down this road towards the east and follow it north to the Crossroads. Find Thork within its walls, he has the Earthmother's blessing. "

4001,Journey into Thunder Bluff,Speak with Cairne Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff. ,"You will now be revered within our great city.

4002,Break Sharptusk! ,Bring the head of Chief Sharptusk Thornmantle to Brave Windfeather in Red Cloud Mesa. ,"<name> - I have heard of you, newcomer.  Perhaps it is you that will help us, where others have failed. We tauren have carved a home out of this land, but not without a cost.  The Bristleback quilboars of Brambleblade Ravine, led by Chief Sharptusk Thornmantle, have made our lives difficult with their continued war against us.  I charge you to bring me the chief's head! He will be found in the ravine to the east in their makeshift village. "
4003,Dwarven Digging,Collect 5 Prospector's Picks. ,"There are dwarves preparing a dig site to the northwest.  They think secrets lie in the earth, and that is true, but hollowing and defiling the land is no way to earn its teachings. Collect the dwarven tools of digging, smash them, and return to me with the dwarves' broken tools. You can smash the tools at a forge.  You will find one in Thunder Bluff, but any forge -- even a forge at the dwarven camp -- will suffice. "
4004,Attack on Camp Narache,Bring the Bristleback Attack Plans to Chief Hawkwind in Camp Narache. ,"After carefully evaluating the map, you realize that what you discovered are the plans made by the Bristleback warchief for an extended siege on Camp Narache. Surely Chief Hawkwind could use this information! "
4005,The Hunt Continues,Grull Hawkwind in Camp Narache wants you to bring him 10 Mountain Cougar Pelts. ,A tauren skilled in the ways of the hunt knows that his prey is not for mere trophy. The beasts of the plains provide us with a means of survival. You will make quite an impression on the elders if you can bring back some highly valued Mountain Cougar Pelts. You can find the beasts lurking in the hills to the south. Our children need clothing and our tents need mending. 
4006,The Hunter's Way,Bring 4 Flatland Prowler Claws to Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff. ,"You are eager to explore, I can tell.  I too had the lust to wander, once. . . Wander, and hunt.  For hunting is a Tauren's greatest honor. If you truly wish to follow the ways of the hunter, then Melor Stonehoof can show you the path.  He is in Thunder Bluff, on the Hunter's Rise. And to show him your skill and resolve, bring him the claws of the flatland prowlers of Mulgore.  They are tough and cunning -- fitting prey for a young <class> on the hunter's path. "
4007,Rites of the Earthmother,Take the Totem of Hawkwind to Baine Bloodhoof in Bloodhoof Village. ,"For you to continue with the Rites of the Earthmother you must pass two more tests. It is time for you to broaden your experience, <name>. Travel to Bloodhoof Village and seek out the Chief, Baine Bloodhoof, son of Cairne. There you may continue your journey and earn the acceptance of the elders of Thunder Bluff. Take this totem to Baine. He will recognize my carvings and help you on your path. Follow the road out of Camp Narache and travel with haste. Do not stray or you will lose your way. "
4008,Rite of Vision,Collect 2 Well Stones and 2 Ambercorn and bring them back to Zarlman Two-Moons in Bloodhoof Village. ,"In order to pass through the Rite of Vision, you must gather the reagents needed to make the Water of the Seers. I will need well stones, which can be found around the water wells in Mulgore. With those I will combine Ambercorn, which fall beneath the mighty trees in our land. These reagents contain magical elements, and when brewed and consumed before the tribal fire, will cause you to encounter a vision. Follow it, and it will lead you to the next step of this holy quest. "
4009,Poison Water,Bring 6 Prairie Wolf Paws and 4 Plainstrider Talons to Mull Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof. ,"Goblins and their servants have tainted our sacred water wells!  We cannot allow this. To cleanse each well, I must create a cleansing totem, then you must bring the totem to the well and perform a cleansing ritual. First we will create a cleansing totem for the Winterhoof Water Well.  To do this, the land must offer its aid. Hunt prairie wolves for their paws and adult plainstriders for their talons.  They are to the southwest. Return to me with the paws and talons, <name>. "
4010,Rite of Wisdom,Travel to Red Rocks east of Thunder Bluff and speak with the Ancestral Spirit. ,"To gain acceptance amongst the elders of Thunder Bluff you must next complete the Rite of Wisdom. Now that you have passed the Rite of Vision, the ancestral spirits of Red Rocks will give you the blessing of our ancestors. Only those who have drunk from the Water of Seers can gain the blessing. Travel east of Thunder Bluff, to Red Rocks and seek out the Ancestral Spirit, <name>. "
4011,Sharing the Land,"Kill 10 Palemane Tanners, 8 Palemane Skinners, and 5 Palemane Poachers, then return to Baine Bloodhoof in Bloodhoof Village. ","<name>, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as I have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek out. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land. Palemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled. Words are no longer the answer. "
4012,Rites of the Earthmother,Baine Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff wants you to bring him the Horn of Arra'chea. ,"You have passed the Rites of the Earthmother and earned your place in Thunder Bluff. But in order to maintain the spot that you strived so hard to achieve, you must continue to prove your worth to your people. We are hunters, <name>.

4013,Rite of Strength,Kill Bristlebacks in Brambleblade Ravine and bring 8 Bristleback Belts to Chief Hawkwind in Camp Narache. ,The Rites of the Earthmother are the steps a young tauren needs to take to gain respect in Thunder Bluff. First you must pass the Rite of Strength. In this test you must prove your bravery by slaying enemies of the tribe. Bristlebacks of Brambleblade Ravine to the east are encroaching on our tribal lands. They ambush our hunting parties and steal from the village by dark. Show your valor by slaying these villains and return to the Chief in Camp Narache with their belts as proof of your deeds. 
4014,The Venture Co. ,Kill 14 Venture Co. ,"This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in Mulgore. Those goblins. . . their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background. Greedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message. "

We live together and work together. Our commitment to one another carries with it a high degree of responsibility. I ask of you now a humble task. My mother set out this morning to fetch water from the well to the southeast of Narache. It has been quite some time now. Perhaps you could check on her for me while I attend to tribal matters here? 
4017,Thunderhorn Totem,Bring 6 Stalker Claws and 6 Cougar Claws to Mull Thunderhorn. ,"To create the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem, you must gather the claws of the predators of the Mulgore plains.

4018,A Task Unfinished,Bring the Bundle of Furs to Innkeeper Kauth in Bloodhoof Village. ,"<name>, please, I beg of you, can you help me? I have not finished my tasks here on the Mesa--I'm in the middle of my Rite of Strength--and my father asked me to deliver these furs to the inn in Bloodhoof. I'm far from rested enough to complete both my rite and this task for my father. Would you mind going on for me? The inn is pleasant and a perfect place to rest during your long travels. I'm sure you'll agree once you see it. "
4019,Wildmane Totem,Bring 8 Prairie Alpha Teeth to Mull Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof Village. ,"There is but one water well left to cleanse, named after the Wildmane clan.  For this well to be pure, the land must offer the teeth of a fierce predator, the prairie wolf alpha.  Find the alphas to the north, then return to me when your hunt is finished. Alphas often wander around the base of our mighty city, Thunder Bluff. "
4020,Rite of Vision,Speak with Zarlman Two-Moons in Bloodhoof Village. ,"The Rite of Vision, one of the Rites of the Earthmother, will help guide you toward earning the respect of the elders of Thunder Bluff. Our people have learned that the land is our most holy provider. In order to take part in the ritualistic vision, you must speak with the spiritual leader of the village, Zarlman Two-Moons. "
4021,Journey into Thunder Bluff,Speak with Baine Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff. ,"You will now be revered within our great city. Any <race> worthy of completing the Rites of the Earthmother earns that honor. For your final quest, seek out our young leader, Baine Bloodhoof, who dwells atop the highest mesa in Thunder Bluff. "
4022,Swoop Hunting,Bring 8 Trophy Swoop Quills to Harken Windtotem in Bloodhoof Village. ,"The swoop is a cunning bird, and difficult to find and hunt.  A collection of Swoop Quills is a badge of cleverness and determination for a hunter. If you are willing to take up this task, then enter the plains and hunt the swoop. Bring me their quills, and bring honor to your clan. The swoops may be found anywhere in Mulgore, but your eyes must be sharp to spot them, and your hooves must be quick to catch them. "
4023,Rites of the Earthmother,Take the Totem of Hawkwind to Ahmo Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof Village. ,"For you to continue with the Rites of the Earthmother you must pass two more tests. It is time for you to broaden your experience, <name>. Travel to Bloodhoof Village and seek out the Ahmo Thunderhorn.

4024,The Hunt Begins,Grull Hawkwind in Camp Narache wants you to bring him 7 Plainstrider Feathers and 7 pieces of Plainstrider Meat. ,"You have a promising air about you, and will prove yourself to the tribe. Perhaps someday soon you will be welcomed into the great city of Thunder Bluff. But before that can happen you must prove yourself to my father, Chief Hawkwind. Up here on Red Cloud Mesa we pride ourselves on keen hunting skills. Tauren hunt out of necessity and for sport. Our supply of meats has run low and we require feathers for clothing. Hunt the nearby plainstriders and prove yourself by resupplying the village. "
4025,The Ravaged Caravan,Return the Venture Co. ,"Prying open the lid reveals a tightly packed assortment of ore and minerals, more evidence of the Venture Co. 's mining operation in Mulgore. On the top of the ore and minerals you remove a tightly bound sheaf of papers. Up in the foothills to the east, you can barely hear the sounds of work, and see smoke rising from a large fire. "
4026,Rites of the Earthmother,Travel to Seer Graytongue who lives in the hills directly south of Camp Narache. ,"Your willingness to perform a humble task for the tauren of Narache and your eagerness to learn are noble traits, <name>. I believe one day you will be heralded in Thunder Bluff as a <class> of greatness. Before that you must embark on the Rites of the Earthmother, of which there are three. The first test is the Rite of Strength. Travel to Seer Graytongue and tell him Chief Hawkwind has sent you. You will find the seer's abode directly to the south of Camp Narache, tucked away in the hills. "
4027,A Humble Task,Take a Water Pitcher from the water well. ,"I have traveled many paths through life and these old legs lack the vigor they once had. I can still perform my duties to the tribe. Sometimes it just takes an old woman a little longer to do the task. But you look like an eager <class>. Let's put some of that youthful vitality to the test. Take a water pitcher from the well and bring it to my son, the Chief, in Camp Narache. Remember that even the most humble task can gain the recognition of elders. "
4029,A Sacred Burial,Lorekeeper Raintotem wants you to kill 8 Bristleback Interlopers at Red Rocks. ,"Only the most valiant tauren are laid to rest at Red Rocks, our sacred burial ground. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend Thunder Bluff and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their tribes and chieftains. But it appears a foul menace has made its way onto our holy land. A band of Bristleback Interlopers is ravaging the grave site and I am too old and past my prime to drive them away. They must be driven off with force, <name>. "
4030,Winterhoof Cleansing,"Use the Winterhoof Cleansing Totem at the Winterhoof Water Well, then return to Mull Thunderhorn. ","I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well.  Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.  You will find it to the southeast, guarded by foul goblins! This will not be an easy task, but you must do it if we are ever to use its waters again. Fortune to you, <name>. "
4031,Mazzranache,"Bring a Prairie Wolf Heart, Flatland Cougar Femur, Plainstrider Scale and Swoop Gizzard to Maur Raincaller at Bloodhoof Village. ","My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named Mazzranache. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite. As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I will need some hard-to-find animal parts to clean the infection from his bite: a wolf heart, cougar femur, plainstrider scale and swoop gizzard. Hurry, time is of the essence. "
4032,Learn to Ride in Orgrimmar,Return the pamphlet to Kildar in Orgrimmar's Valley of Honor. ,This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Kildar. Kildar can be found in Orgrimmar 's Valley of Honor. 
4033,The Darkmoon Faire,"Deliver the Free Ticket Voucher to Gelvas Grimgate, located inside the Darkmoon Faire carnival. ","The Darkmoon Faire is coming!  Be sure to experience all the wonders and excitement of it when it comes to town! If you act right now, you can redeem this voucher for free prize tickets!  Just hand your voucher to Gelvas Grimgate located inside the carnival. Right now, the Faire is just outside Thunder Bluff, in Mulgore.  Don't miss out!  Go today! "
4034,Hidden Enemies,Bring a Lieutenant's Insignia to Thrall in Orgrimmar. ,"One thing I will not tolerate are traitors in our midst, <name>. But I would be a fool to play my hand so early--it would not sufficiently cut the corruption out of our lands and only cause the infection to grow worse. But you, a young adventurer, could go places my agents could not. . . could learn the truth. . . could find the true head of the beast. If you are brave enough, then enter Skull Rock to the east of Orgrimmar, find a lieutenant's insignia off one of the Burning Blade there, and return to me. "
4035,A Most Puzzling Circumstance,Take the Head of Onyxia to Neeru Fireblade in the Cleft of Shadow. ,You have accomplished the truly impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Seize her head and deliver it to Neeru Fireblade. 
4036,Hidden Enemies,Take the Lieutenant's Insignia to Neeru Fireblade and speak to him. ,"Now let us see if this insignia you found is worth the effort. There is a warlock within the city who believes he has my trust. He does not know that I realize where his true loyalties lie. He is in fact the leader of the Burning Blade. But do not rush off to do battle with him; he has a purpose, and we shall use him against our enemies. Take this insignia to him in the Cleft of Shadow here in Orgrimmar, speak to him and see if he believes you are one of his own, then return to me here. "
4037,A Life Without Regret,Take the portal to Undercity located in Grommash Hold and report to Vol'jin. ,"On the day of my death I wish to be able to say that I lived a life without regret. Those who mourn my passing will know that I was a Warchief who made decisions that best served his people. But this betrayal by Varimathras and Putress. . . All that we have worked for is for nothing. < Thrall 's chest heaves with a heavy sigh. >Justice must be served. Portals to Undercity will be active momentarily. Vol'jin will be waiting for you. I will meet you there soon. Together we will make it right, <name>. "
4038,Hidden Enemies,Speak to Thrall in Orgrimmar and tell him what you've learned. ,"You are one of my lieutenants! Prepare yourself, <class>. I will call upon you soon. My time spent on the Searing Blade may be all but wasted now, but that does not mean that the Shadow Council's schemes elsewhere must suffer. I will do what I can to minimize the damage here in Ragefire Chasm. In the meantime, I will have my agents in the Barrens and Ashenvale begin work on our newest agenda. Return to me soon. "
4039,Betrayed,Deliver the Sealed Letter to Ag'tor to Ag'tor Bloodfist in Azshara. ,"Betraying, thieving elf! That's what I call her--that's all she'll ever be! I may have made a grave mistake, <name>. I trusted a blood elf. She claimed Azshara would hold great riches. . . powerful items. I simply send some warriors with her to protect her and I would be rewarded. Well, look who's the fool--she's killed them all. I want vengeance, <name>, but I can't afford to send anyone else. Find Ag'tor at Valormok, north of the Haldarr Encampment. He'll tell you more. "
4040,Eitrigg's Wisdom,Speak with Eitrigg in Orgrimmar. ,"Rend lives? Impossible! It had been thought that Rend  was slain decades ago. Seek out the wisdom of Eitrigg, <name>. None know the workings of the Blackrock better than he and if what is written here bares truth, Eitrigg should be informed. No person should be denied the right of vengeance. You will find him in Orgrimmar. Once you have spoken with Eitrigg, confer with the Warchief to find out what he wishes to do about this problem. "
4041,A New Beginning,Meet with a &lt; class&gt; trainer in Orgrimmar. ,"A letter magically appears in the lining of your armor. It reads:

""Welcome to Orgrimmar, capital of the Horde!

Meet with a <class> trainer to begin your training. They will help prepare you for your journey across Azeroth and beyond. """
4042,Alliance Relations,Speak to Keldran in Orgrimmar. ,"Be still, <class>, and allow me to share with you something important to our people, but far from obvious. We are a proud race, and the war with the humans tried even Thrall's great patience. You see, our Warchief is wise and prudent, and he continues to put his people first. Ultimately, he is a diplomat, and in his time with the humans he learned much of their ways. If the tale I've started piques your interest, then find Keldran near the western exit of the city. His hovel is there. "
4043,A Fair Trade,"Greetings, &lt; race&gt; . ","Excellent! I am a Tauren of my word, <race>. The arrows are yours. "
4044,March of the Silithid,Speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg in Gadgetzan. ,"It would seem that the silithid's intent, nay - reason for being, is to devour everything in their path that is not of their ecology.  Their focus is singular, and it is for this reason they are a grave threat to all life on Azeroth. What we've seen to date is but the first stages.  I suspect that their strength comes from deeper in Kalimdor: Un'Goro Crater.  Go to Gadgetzan in the Tanaris desert and speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg.  Tell him of my theory; he will surely aid us in fighting the silithid. "
4045,A Donation of Silk,"As with most other fabrics, our stocks of silk are at an all-time low. ","Wonderful!  We thank you for your generous donation, <name>! "
4046,Hidden Enemies,Speak to Neeru Fireblade in Orgrimmar. ,"I think our next step should be to have you placed close to Neeru. If he is as agitated as reports suggest, then we may accomplish two things. One, you may be able to gain some greater knowledge about the Council or at least the Burning Blade, and two, he may just begin to trust you enough that he asks you to start to aid him. He may very well look at you as someone who can fill the void now that some of the leadership is in turmoil. Return to the Cleft and speak to him again, but do not be too overt. "
4047,Victory for the Horde,Take the Head of Onyxia to Thrall in Orgrimmar. ,You have accomplished the impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Take her head and present it to your Warchief. 
4048,Betrayed,Speak to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar. ,"Return to Belgrom in Orgrimmar. He will want to see her head for himself! We'll return there shortly. Ah, this is indeed a good day. Thank you for your help, <name>. "
4049,Meeting the Warchief,"Lady Sylvanas Windrunner wants you to take the Letter Sealed by Sylvanas to Thrall in Orgrimmar, capital of Durotar. ","I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know.  I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table. This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Thrall in Orgrimmar.  As leader of the Horde he will have the final say on accepting your race's pledge. I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement.  Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower. "
4050,Nogg's Ring Redo,"Bring the Brilliant Gold Ring, a Silver Bar, a Moss Agate, and 30 silver coins to Nogg in Orgrimmar. ","No, no, no - I'm not all of the sudden saying that the ring is mine.  I normally don't do this, but your information about the Dark Irons was very useful.  I'll improve your ring for you, better than whomever made this simple little thing could have ever done.  Probably some gnome. . . If you bring me a bar of silver, a moss agate, and thirty silver coins for my trouble, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will strengthen the magic inside of it.  Interested? "
4051,Betrayed,"Kill 10 Blood Elf Reclaimers, and 10 Blood Elf Surveyors before seeking out Magus Rimtori's camp. ",I thought as much. We start our crusade against her workers along the southern bluffs on the northern peninsula of Azshara. Kill them with bloody rage--let them know they've betrayed the wrong allies. Do not concern yourself with her yet--she spends most of her time with her bodyguards searching Azshara. It would be prudent after you've slain her workers to find her personal camp. Scouting out where we can attack her would be wise. Perhaps there is something there we can use to provoke her. 
4052,Tools for Survival,Open the survival kit and equip a weapon. ,"Before we begin, you need to be equipped with weapons and armor suited to your talents. The life of an adventurer is never dull, and you never know what will happen next!

I've prepared a survival kit for your adventures. It contains additional weapons, armor, and rations. I trust that you will make use of it well. "
4053,Anthion's Parting Words,"Return to Mokvar in Orgimmar with a set of  Shadowcraft Boots, Shadowcraft Pants and Shadowcraft Spaulders. ","Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet.  In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us. The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the amulet back together.  Return to Mokvar and tell him that Bodley is his only hope for finding the remaining pieces.  Speak to him about any rewards you've arranged for. I, for once, shall rest in peace.  I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it! "
4054,The Champion of the Horde,Seek out Rokaro at Shadowprey Village in Desolace. ,"Rexxar, one of my most loyal champions, has discovered a way into the lair of the dragon. However he has left Azeroth to join our expedition into Outland. However, he left his companion, Rokaro, in Shadowprey Village with this information. You are to seek him out. "
4055,The Ashenvale Hunt,"Speak with Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale. ","Attention, young adventurers!  The wilds of Ashenvale await you! The Horde has established a strong presence in the lands north of the Barrens.  Our two outposts - Splintertree Post and the Zoram Strand Outpost - strive to bring glory to the Horde!  Those who would prove themselves should seek out guidance there.  Of note: Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post, directly north of the Barrens, seeks adventurers willing to take part in a great hunt of Ashenvale! "
4056,The Burning of Spirits,Return the Burning Gem and 15 Infused Burning Gems to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace. ,"Death is most desirable for those despicable creatures that turn their back on their liege for such selfish reasons. But death is not enough when dealing with those that have given themselves over to the darkness. Take this gem. When one of the Burning Blade's near death, activate its magic. The spell shall pull the corrupted spirit out of its victim, leaving an infused gem behind. Bring me these infused gems so I may dispose of them properly. Go now, and may you elude death. "
4057,The Swarm Grows,Deliver Belgrom's Sealed Note to Moktar Krin in Thousand Needles. ,"So, Korran has come to a similar conclusion about these insects--they seem to be a larger threat than we assumed. A few days ago a hunter returned to me from Thousand Needles nearly dead. He was with a raiding party sent to drive a dwarven excavation team out of the Shimmering Flats. During the attack, more of these insects erupted from a cave in the dig site and nearly killed the party. They were led by Moktar Krin, and they've taken refuge on the border of the Shimmering Flats. Bring him this note. "
4058,Befouled by Satyr,"Slay 7 Hatefury Rogues, 7 Hatefury Felsworn, 7 Hatefury Betrayers, and 7 Hatefury Hellcallers, and return to Takata Steelblade in Desolace. ","A demon infestation does not occur without other influences--something else allows evil to gain a foothold. It may start with a weakened spirit, a needless desire for power; perhaps it's a thirst for revenge, or the appeal for final justice. When we are beset by pain, evil takes advantage of us--evil such as the satyr. Ties have been made between them and the Burning Blade, and Thrall would have them slain. Seek them out to the northeast of here, and return to me when you've driven them back. "
4059,Bone-Bladed Weapons,Bring 8 White Ravasaur Claws to Jes'rimon in Orgrimmar. ,"Hmm, maybe there be somethin' you can do for the Hand now that me think 'bout it. Yes, Jes'rimon could use your help for sure. In Un'Goro Crater there be raptors with deadly claws. Some of those raptors sometimes have white claws instead of ones black like death. The Hand have. . . clients. . . that like weapons crafted from these claws. Bring me many of those white claws, and me pay you good coin. Do it fast enough, and maybe me help you in other ways. "
4060,Anthion's Parting Words,"Return to Mokvar in Orgimmar with a set of Beaststalker's Boots, Beaststalker's Pants and Beaststalker's Mantle. ","Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet.  In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us. The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the amulet back together.  Return to Mokvar and tell him that Bodley is his only hope for finding the remaining pieces.  Speak to him about any rewards you've arranged for. I, for once, shall rest in peace.  I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it! "
4061,A Donation of Wool,We are currently accepting donations for wool cloth. ,"Wonderful!  We thank you for your generous donation, <name>! "
4062,Combat Training,Train a spell by speaking to a &lt; class&gt; trainer. ,"As you grow in power, so does your capabilities of being a skillful <class>.

You can find trainers all around Azeroth, and in capital cities such as here in Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, or the Undercity.

There's a price to this knowledge, but I will reimburse you just this once. When you are ready, speak with me again to train your abilities. "
4063,Saving the Best for Last,Give Mokvar your Coif of Elements and Vest of Elements. ,"A truly amazing story, <name>! You have my thanks, and the heartfelt gratitude of all who were involved, I can assure you. Through your efforts we are delivered from the mistakes of our past. As to your reward, I believe I have a few things that you have definitely earned and will truly enjoy. "
4064,Ripple Recovery,Talk to Malton Droffers in Orgrimmar. ,"I've got some salvage work for you, and if you're an aficionado of fine ripple like I am, then you'll love this task.  Ripple! It's a drink, you dummy. An abandoned Horde outpost has a stash of Hinterlands Honey Ripple from when they were in business.  You can't get fine ripple like that anymore!  One of Malton's dummy associates knows the shot, so you'll go out there and bring me a case of packaged ripple, and two for my own collection!  Talk to Malton, he'll fill you in on the details. "
4065,A Donation of Runecloth,"&lt; name&gt; , you've been a tremendous contributor to our cloth drive. ","Fantastic - these will go right to use, I assure you.  Thank you again for your assistance!  We'd certainly be lost without you. With all the donations you've made, I would certainly process any additional runecloth donations you care to make in the future.  Just be sure to check in with me, and I'll personally make sure that your good deeds won't go unrecognized! "
4066,Just Compensation,Bring a Shadowcraft Belt and a set of Shadowcraft Gloves to Mokvar in Orgrimmar. ,"You've proven to be a very reliable individual, <name>.  As much as I trust that you'll help me through this predicament, it would be wise of me to reward you according to your performance. For now I will exchange your belt and gloves.

4137,What Tomorrow Brings,"Venture to the Caverns of Time in Tanaris and find Anachronos, Brood of Nozdormu. ","The embrace of death had all but overcome my being when he intervened. He breathed only once upon my maimed body and then waited patiently for the sands of time to cleanse my wounds. ""Forever you will remain if you must, "" he said, and with those words I was bound as a Watcher. Look now to the desert. The second war is upon us. You must seek out the resting place of the Bronze. Venture to the Caverns of Time and see if the master has returned. I must be sure before I am able to proceed. "
4138,Glyph Chasing,"Rutgar Glyphshaper at Bronzebeard's Encampment in Silithus wants you to venture to Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, and Hive'Regal and recover Glyphed Rubbings from the Glyphed Crystals of each hive. ","After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals. We must get a rubbing from crystals in all three hives. If we can get those rubbings, we might be able to make sense of this madness. Take this transcription set  and hit those hives, <name>. Don't come back until you've gotten copies from each hive. "
4139,True Believers,Hermit Ortell wants you to bring him 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts. ,"Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you.

4140,Dukes of the Council,Bring 1 Large Brilliant Shard and 3 Abyssal Crests to Aurel Goldleaf in Cenarion Hold. ,"We think it is possible to use a wind stone to ambush a duke of the Abyssal Council.  To do this, however, one must commune through the wind stone, and convince the council you are a middle ranked leader of the Twilight's Hammer. Such a gambit requires a replica of the cult's medallion of station.  I can create the medallion, but I will need a large brilliant shard, and crests worn by the Abyssal Templar. Bring these to me and I will do the rest. "
4141,Bang a Gong! ,The Scarab Gong looms ominously before you. ,From the ground near the gong springs a special crystal. Perhaps favor from the Brood.

While it is true that you have proven to me that you have the potential makings of a hero, the time has come to prove this to my master. Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, Hive'Regal: All swarming with activity and all a threat to our existence. Slay silithid at these hives and take from them a fragment of their carapace. When you can carry no more, return to me and I shall strengthen your resolve. "
4143,Abyssal Contacts,Bor Wildmane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to destroy an Abyssal Templar and bring him an Abyssal Crest as proof of the deed. ,We've seen the Twilight's Hammer cultists performing rituals to summon powerful elemental nobles.

I want you to find a way to contact an Abyssal Templar and give it a proper beating!  Nothing throws the troops in disarray like taking out the chain of command.  Bring back proof while you're at it.

You will find Captain Blackanvil's Ironforge Brigade outside Hive'Zora. Report to him or his lieutenant, Janela Stouthammer and come back to me.  I shall have a more advanced assignment for you ready. Oh and please do us a favor and stay away from the Orgrimmar Legion.  We've been forced to keep the two forces well apart from one another due to mutual animosity. "

The only dangers we faced were from the creatures that made this place their home and the oppressive sand and dust and heat. But now the Alliance seems to have caught on to what we have found here. It is now a race between us to capture the natural resources, and keep them from the other. I need every set of hands that is available. I hope I have yours. "

","To our southwest lies a tragic site - the ruins of Southwind Village.  This is where our work should begin, <name>. From what we've learned, this village was once a night elf base of operations for Silithus.  It's long since overrun by the silithid hives that infest the wastes.  I can only imagine the horror of the village's initial sundering. . . The tortured spirits of fallen druids and sentinels wander the ruins aimlessly.

We are certain you will succeed in this endeavor. 
4156,Stalwart's Battlegear,"Bring 15 Cenarion Combat Badges, 20 Cenarion Logistics Badges, 17 Cenarion Tactical Badges and 1 Mark of Remulos to Vargus at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.

I've seen the Cenarion Circle forces arrive at Silithus.  They plan to drive the Twilight's Hammer out, don't they?  This will help. Take this parchment to their leader, Commander Mar'alith.

I'm convinced that while we hold it our victory over the silithid is guaranteed.  Provided our influx supplies can be maintained, that is. Desert worms have proven to be more of a threat to our supply caravans than even the silithid themselves.  Just this morning, a large shipment of morrowgrain was ravaged by a group of dredge strikers.  I need you to thin their numbers to ensure our supplies aren't jeopardized. "
4162,Medallion of Station,"If you need another Twilight cultist's medallion of station, then I am happy to oblige. ","Here you are, <name>.  One more Twilight medallion of station.  Use it well, and I wish you luck against the Abyssal Council! "

Above the glyphs is what I can only assume to be a code of some sort. This code might very well be the key to summoning the emissary. I will create a copy of the glyph code that you must use in the sand at the Bones of Grakkarond. If I am right, the Overlords will come thinking that new data is ready for transmission. Strike them down and confront the emissary. He holds the key to the crystals. . . "
4165,"Umber, Archivist","Take the Encrusted Silithid Object to Umber - the Cenarion Circle's archivist - in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade. ","There's plenty to do here still, but I think taking this back to the Circle for analysis is key.  Trust me - the work will still be here once this is all said and done.  If it's a journal inside this sticky chitin, then the Circle would finally have a window into the past! Take this to the Circle's archivist in Nighthaven.  His name is Umber, and the man's brilliant.  Touched, sure, but brilliant nonetheless! Umber 's salvaged tomes in far worse shape than this.  If it can be saved, he can do it. "
4166,"Wanted - Deathclasp, Terror of the Sands","Bring Deathclasp's Pincer to Vish Kozus, Captain of the Guard.

They hunt me to this day like I'm some sort of beast!  Needless to say, an enemy of theirs is a friend of mine! To decipher this Tablet I'll need the book used by their scribes to encode secret messages: the Twilight Lexicon.

Look for them at the Twilight's Hammer camps. "
4173,Hive in the Tower,Scale the tower of Southwind Village and locate a means to stir the silithid hive into activity. ,"The hive needs to be addressed in Southwind Village, and I think I know a way to get at them.  It's been my experience that the silithid hives are very sensitive to their environment; this explains their attacks when hearing the death wails of the spirits. The silithid are strongest in the tower - the one with the mass of wasps circling it.  Scale the tower and jostle the hive into activity.  Report back what you learn, but be careful!  If you uncover anything that might help, bring it to me. "

4177,Stepping Up Security,Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to slay 20 Dredge Crushers. ,"Your performance has been truly exemplary so far, <name>.  Our supply lines are not completely safe yet, however.  In the absence of dredge strikers, their larger southern cousins will surely move in to take their place in the north. You'll have to kill quite a few dredge crushers to keep them at bay, but we cannot leave the safety of our supply lines to chance. "
4178,Desert Survival Kits,"Bring 4 Globes of Water, 4 Powerful Anti-Venom and 4 Baked Salmon to Calandrath at the inn in Cenarion Hold in Silithus.

","The Twilight's Hammer operates through innumerable layers of secrecy and deceit.  While their actions are carried out in our world, they are planned in a place we have not yet been able to reach. We've come to believe that the stones the Twilight's Hammer uses to summon their superiors allow for two-way transportation.  To attempt to use them in this manner, we must replicate - to every last detail - a twilight emissary's robe. Gather the necessary materials and bring them to Aurel Goldleaf, <name>. "

Within the Charred Vale, deep in Stonetalon, there used to be a species of basilisks whose scales, when ground to dust, made a wonderful reagent for some spells I've created.

I have no doubt you love the night elves and their allies as little as I. Aid me, and both our ends might be satisfied. "
4243,Kill Grundig Darkcloud,"Kill Grundig Darkcloud and 6 Grimtotem Brutes, and return to Makaba Flathoof near the southeastern edge of Stonetalon.

Hopefully, he'll be able to find me a new job! I'll try and clean up this mess a little, but you should take the ore sample to Ziz right away.

4249,A Scroll from Mauren,Find Collin Mauren in Stormwind. ,"Okay, now for the remote detonation part of my plan. . . oh, I haven't explained that yet, have I? Okay, so the short of it is this: with a little magic, I can make it so the explosives go off while you're not around. I'm putting together a device that'll allow you to push just one button and have the NG-5 explode when you're ready. But I need a spell from a friend in Stormwind-- Collin Mauren is his name. You can find him in the mage quarter there. He's human, so he shouldn't be hard to miss. "
4250,Goblin Invaders,Kill 15 Venture Co. ,"The goblin-run Venture Company moved into the Stonetalon Mountains, chopping down trees and burning huge stretches of forest.  The spirits of this place are nearly blind with pain and rage.  We must stop the Venture Company! Head northwest, beyond the Greatwood Vale and into the Windshear Crag.

4252,Bloodfury Bloodline,Maggran at Sun Rock Retreat wishes you to slay Bloodfury Ripper and bring her remains as proof of your deed. ,"Limiting the number of Bloodfury Harpies will not be enough. The only true cure for their disease would be to slay their leader, Bloodfury Ripper! She is all but a queen to those filthy creatures. Slay her and their numbers will surely diminish.

4254,Gerenzo's Orders,Get the mysterious ore from Piznik after he finishes mining it. ,"You know, I was once the second most important person here at this site.

His new boss will pay us well if we can find out what Gerenzo's plans are. Anyways, what I do know is that Gerenzo has ordered large amounts of this gold-green ore to be mined.

","Tauren take pride as the protector of these lands. Undoubtedly you can guess why I am alarmed with the number of harpies that dwell here in Stonetalon. The Bloodfuries are the source of the increasing number of harpies in Kalimdor; they encroach upon all likes of life preventing the innocent from leaving their boundaries. I need you to cull the harpies, <name>! "

4257,Super Reaper 6000,Get the Super Reaper 6000 Blueprints for Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains. ,"Terrible what the Venture Company has done here, eh? What were they thinking?

4259,Reception from Tyrande,Find Tyrande Whisperwind in Darnassus. ,"<name>, I am sure Tyrande Whisperwind herself would like to thank you for taking part in this mission.

4264,Further Instructions,Bring the new orders to Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains. ,"The matter of this gnome that has been hired by the Venture Company has caused a bit of a stir in Undermine. The trade princes do not approve of Razdunk's consorting with this Gerenzo. Riddlevox has asked me to take care of the problem, and I'm sure he was instructed to do so by one or more of the trade princes. Of course, the Director didn't tell me that. Let's just say I have a hunch. Whatever the case, Gerenzo must be removed, and it would be a fitting test to have Fizziks take care of him. "

Drive the wretched harpies out, <name>! "
4266,Wounded Ancients,Bring a piece of Corroded Shrapnel to Kaela Shadowspear in Stonetalon. ,"It seems obvious to me that the protectors of the Vale--the treants--had something to do with the Venture Co. being driven back. Unfortunately, even those once great guardians have now become corrupt. Gaxim thinks their corruption is somehow linked to the weapons the goblins used during their retreat. I told him I'd collect a sample from a wounded treant and allow him to study it in order to figure out if that's true. Bring me some of the shrapnel so the gnome can tell me more. . . "
4267,Reclaiming the Charred Vale,Travel to Falfindel Waywarder on the border of Thousand Needles and Feralas. ,"The Bloodfuries have been subdued.

4268,The Elder Crone,Speak with Magatha in Thunder Bluff. ,"To truly tend the spirits of Stonetalon we must consult the tauren elders. I do not know many of their leaders' names, but I do know of one: Magatha.  I have heard that she is very old, and she knows much.  If anyone can marshal spiritual aid from the tauren, it is she.

I am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news.  The task is left to you, young <class>.  We can only hope that the deranged Gnarlpines have not made it to Ban'ethil yet! "
4399,A Friend in Need,Speak to Dirania Silvershine in Shadowglen. ,Ughhh. . . I was bitten very badly by a spider named Githyiss the Vile while exploring the spider cave very close to here. I am sure I have been seriously poisoned; you must help me. Please tell Dirania Silvershine. She will be able to help me. Hurry. . . I'm so dizzy. . . 
4400,Webwood Venom,Bring 10 Webwood Venom Sacs to Gilshalan Windwalker at Aldrassil. ,"I came to Shadowglen to observe the webwood spiders that dwell in the Shadowthread Cave.  They are cousin to a much smaller variety of spider; I believe the world tree has had a profound effect on them, and I would like specimens to study to confirm this. First, I would like some of their venom.  Gather Webwood venom sacs from the spiders in and around the Shadowthread Cave, to the north.  I can then examine them for similarities with their smaller cousin's venom. "
4401,Planting the Heart,Plant the Tainted Heart in Denalan's Planter. ,"I have removed that foul moss from the heart, but it remains tainted. . . Try placing the heart in my planter.  It is filled with a nutritive soil that may cleanse and heal the heart. "
4402,The Emerald Dreamcatcher,Bring the Emerald Dreamcatcher to Tallonkai Swiftroot in Dolanaar. ,"I was once given an emerald dreamcatcher from Gaerolas Talvethen, the warden of the druids in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. This powerful amulet is able to siphon energy from the Emerald Dream, bestowing luck upon those who carry it. Sadly, I have not been able to retrieve it from my dresser in Starbreeze Village. . . Although Starbreeze was once a tranquil place, it has now succumbed to the corruption of the furbolg that reside there. Perhaps you would be willing to recover my dreamcatcher, <class>? "
4403,Rellian Greenspyre,Bring a Timberling Seed to Rellian Greenspyre in Darnassus. ,"<name>, can you take one of the seeds you brought me to my friend, Rellian Greenspyre?  He is a druid in Darnassus, and when last we spoke he revealed his interest in my work with the Timberlings.  He had some ideas himself, and he will appreciate a specimen seed to work with. Thank you, <name>.  You have been a great help to me.  I hope that, some day, you will see the fruit of my labors. You will usually find Rellian walking the pathways of the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus. "
4404,Iverron's Antidote,Bring Iverron's Antidote to Iverron before the time limit is up. ,"The antidote is ready, <name>. Please see that Iverron drinks it. There is something that you should know -- the antidote -- it will only remain viable for 5 minutes. You must get it to him in time. Speed be with you, <name>. "
4405,Crown of the Earth,Fill the Amethyst Phial and bring it back to Corithras Moonrage in Dolanaar. ,"All was not well with Teldrassil, however. Staghelm's carefully made plans for the new World Tree had borne out as he had hoped, but there was one small problem, a problem to which many of the troubles on Teldrassil may be attributed. However, I will not get into that yet. You must visit the last moonwell, to the northwest in the Oracle Glade. Under the boughs of the Oracle Tree lies the first and most powerful of our wells. Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me. "
4406,Iverron's Antidote,"Collect 7 Hyacinth Mushrooms, 4 Moonpetal Lilies, and 1 Webwood Ichor for Dirania Silveshine in Shadowglen. ","We may be able to help Iverron, as I know of an antidote that should help with the poison. It requires some ingredients, though, before I can make it. I'll need Hyacinth mushrooms. You can find these growing under trees, or you may collect them from the grell south of here; they seem to have taken a liking to them. I'll also need Moonpetal lilies, which only grow around watery pools. The last ingredient may prove the most difficult. From the very spiders that poisoned Iverron, collect Webwood ichor. "
4407,Webwood Egg,Bring a Webwood Egg to Gilshalan in Aldrassil. ,"Now that I have the spiders' venom, I'd like some live specimens to study.  Unfortunately, capturing a living, giant spider is more than I can ask of you, young <class>.  And a giant spider is more than I could handle myself! But if you can find an unhatched egg, then delivering specimens will be much easier, and I can then arrange for the unhatched spiders to be contained. There must be a nest deep in the Shadowthread Cave.  Please, search for an egg in the nest and return it to me. "
4408,Crown of the Earth,Bring the Filled Vessel to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus. ,"Without the blessings of Alexstrasza the Life-Binder and Nozdormu the Timeless, Teldrassil 's growth has not been without flaw. Strange beasts have been reported arising from the very ground of the tree, and crazed furbolgs attack passing travelers. I can only hope that the solution the Arch Druid is looking for will be found quickly. I will pour all the phials you brought into this vessel, for you to deliver to Darnassus. Bring it to Fandral Staghelm, you will find him in the druid grove. "
4409,The Woodland Protector,Collect 8 Fel Moss and bring them to Tarindrella. ,"Something evil is brewing in the forests of Teldrassil.  Look long the hills to where the peaceful furbolgs used to dwell.  They have deserted their homes and are amassing under the name of the Gnarlpine tribe. Only the corruption of wicked Fel Moss could cause such a transformation.  The grells and grellkin have infested the area and are threatening the residents of Shadowglen. Engage these grells and grellkin, <name>, and see if they are indeed caught under the enchantment of the wicked Fel Moss. "
4410,Timberling Seeds,Bring 8 Timberling Seeds to Denelan at Lake Al'Ameth. ,"The timberlings of Teldrassil are elementals of nature.  In some ways they reflect the natural order of plants and animals on our great tree. So it is disturbing to see how angry the timberlings have become. I believe it has something to do with the soil.  I have been working on different methods of nurturing plants and would like to try them on timberling seeds.  Please, can you gather seeds from timberlings around Lake Al'Ameth and bring them to me? "
4411,The Balance of Nature,Kill 4 Young Nightsabers and 4 Young Thistle Boars and return to Conservator Ilthalaine. ,"Greetings, <name>.  I am Conservator Ilthalaine.  My purpose in Shadowglen is to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained. The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered. Unfortunately, the nightsaber and thistle boar populations grew too large.  Shadowglen can only produce so much food for the beasts.  Journey forth, young <class>, and thin the boar and saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved. "
4412,Timberling Sprouts,Bring 12 Timberling Sprouts to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth. ,"Small timberlings are sprouting around the waters of Lake Al'Ameth.  I'm afraid these sprouts are beyond help -- we should try to clear them from the land before they grow large enough to cause trouble. When you're wandering the lake, if you see any timberling sprouts please take them.  Help keep our land clean! "
4413,Seek Redemption! ,Collect 3 Fel Cones and give them to Zenn Foulhoof outside of Dolanaar. ,"The Council of the Forest has news that you aided Zenn Foulhoof. The satyr is an enemy of the forest. As a <race>, you should know better than to defile the forest by killing Nature's creatures. You must redeem yourself in the eyes of the Council if you wish to remain a friend of Teldrassil. Teach Foulhoof a lesson and you shall be redeemed. Fel Cones are corrupted seeds that fall from the trees. They billow with green smoke. Give some to Foulhoof. He'll think you have brought him a harmless snack. "
4414,The Balance of Nature,Conservator Ilthalaine needs you to kill 5 Mangy Nightsabers and 5 Thistle Boars. ,"Thinning the younger population of creatures here in Shadowglen was a good start, <name>, but there is still work to be done. The resources of the forest will be depleted too quickly if the problem is not addressed.  Killing nature's beasts is a necessary evil for the good of all who share the land.  Venture into the forest and slay mangy nightsabers and thistle boars in the name of balance. "
4415,Crown of the Earth,Fill the Crystal Phial and bring it back to Tenaron Stormgrip atop Aldrassil. ,"It is time for you to set out to seek your destiny, <name>. But before you are ready to set out into the world beyond our enchanted forests, there is much you must learn about our recent history. Much has changed with our people since the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Nordrassil lies a pale shadow of what it once was, its power used to defeat Archimonde and drive back the Burning Legion. . . There is a task you must perform. Go to the moonwell north of Aldrassil and return me a phial of its water. "
4416,Denalan's Earth,Bring the package of Rare Earth to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth. ,"Are you heading to the south?  To Lake Al'Ameth?  If so, then I have a task I might ask of you. . . My colleague Denalan has a camp along the eastern end of the lake, where he is studying and experimenting on the plant life of Teldrassil.  He requested a package of rare earths from Darnassus and it was late, only recently arriving here in Dolanaar. Can you take the package to him? "
4417,Tenaron's Summons,Speak with Tenaron Stormgrip atop Aldrassil in Shadowglen. ,"<name>, is it? I heard that Tenaron has been asking for you. You'll find him in the highest room atop Aldrassil. We may live long lives, but it's best you not keep him waiting too long. "
4418,Tyrande and Remulos,Travel to the Moonglade and speak to Keeper Remulos. ,"Tyrande will be notifed, mortal. Shan'do Stormrage has prepared me for this contingency.

Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me. "
4420,Dolanaar Delivery,Bring the Dolanaar Delivery to Innkeeper Keldamyr. ,"Greetings, young <class>.  Can you offer me aid?  I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of Dolanaar.

It lies along the road, to the south. "
4421,Teldrassil,Deliver the Oracle Tree's report to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus. ,"The forest whispers of your feats of valor, <name>. As I felt the harpies forced from their nests, a greater calm spread across the forest, its creatures once again feeling safe. I have feared sending another messenger to the Arch Druid, but I know that you will see my message safely to him. Deliver this to him and know that the forest will see you safely along its paths to the forest of stone. "

Corithras Moonrage will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him. Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in Dolanaar. Follow the road south from Aldrassil out of Shadowglen, and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west. Mind you stay on the road though, <name>. There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late. "

4425,Verog the Dervish,"Bring Verog's Head to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads. ","The centaur Verog the Dervish wanders the Barrens, and will be difficult to find.  But he is based at the centaur command tent at the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast.  It may be possible to draw him to you. Travel to the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast and attack centaur near the command tent.  It will be dangerous, but if you can kill enough centaur then they should raise an alarm.  And Verog will come. Bring me his head and I will place it with Barak Kodobane's. "
4426,Ishamuhale,Bring Ishamuhale's Fang to Jorn at Camp Taurajo. ,"Ishamuhale, Speartooth, is the fiercest sunscale raptor of the Barrens.  He does not hunt for sport, nor for food.  He hunts because hunting is his passion.  He kills because it is his nature to kill. And you will learn of his nature, <name>, for your path now follows the taloned tracks of Ishamuhale.

4427,Echeyakee,Bring Echeyakee's Hide to Sergra Darkthorn at the Crossroads. ,"Whitemist, Echeyakee in the Tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats.  He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth.  And he kills so fast his prey have no time for fear, or pain. The Tauren say he is both mercy and death. You will learn if that's true, for I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee.  His lair is northeast of the Crossroads, among the bones of giant KodoGo.  Blow this horn when you reach his lair.  Blow the horn, and he will come. "
4428,The Angry Scytheclaws,Kill Sunscale raptors and collect their feathers. ,"Now, <name>, the hunt deepens.  Now you must defeat your prey, and then find your way to its lair.

Show their brethren you do not fear them! "
4429,Hezrul Bloodmark,"Bring Hezrul's Head to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads. ","Hezrul Bloodmark is the leader of the Kolkar centaurs in the Barrens.  He is fierce, brutal and cunning.

He leads his people from the Lushwater Oasis, to the south. "
4430,Free From the Hold,Safely escort Gilthares Firebough back to Captain Brightsun in Ratchet. ,"Finally! Someone to rescue me! I can't believe you got past the guards. These zealots from Theramore are out of their minds. They sank our ship and imprisoned me, the only survivor. I was called an enemy and threat to the Alliance. Me! A threat to their great sham of an Alliance? I was a deckhand on a moonshine transport between Ratchet and Booty Bay. Enough talk. Help me get back to Ratchet will you? Let me know when you're ready and we'll make our break. "
4431,Ignition,Get the Ignition Key and bring it to Wizzlecrank. ,"I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem. We need to get out of here on the double! Go up to the control room at the top of the derrick, the supervisor should have a key for this shredder. Help me out here! "
4432,Stolen Silver,Bring the Stolen Silver to Gazrog in the Crossroads. ,"You may have killed the raptors, but the silver they stole must be recovered!

Go to this raptor haven and search for the stolen silver.  When you find it, return it to me. "
4433,Isha Awak,Bring the Heart of Isha Awak to Mahren Skyseer. ,"The grand Isha Awak is lord of these waters.  Great is his strength, and solemn his pride.  The humans on the coast fear him, for he has consumed many of their number. But I do not fear him.  I am grateful he is here.  He is a worthy challenge, and honorable prey. If you are ready, then swim out and search for Isha Awak, the Deep Doom. His spirit dwells in his heart, and to hear its beat is to know your fate. "

","Three of my tribe came out of the Kraul to lead the raids against the Horde, <race>. <snort> They are ruthless and cunning, and if you defeat them, then your Crossroads and even most of the Barrens will learn peace. . . <snort> at least from the Razormane tribe. <snort>Nak, Kuz, and Lok Orcbane are the ones you seek.

4436,Samophlange Manual,Bring the Samophlange Manual to Rilli Greasygob in Orgrimmar. ,"I think I can fix the samophlange, but I'm going to need the user's manual first.  When I was in the Venture Company I had a rival, Boss Copperplug, who hoarded the secrets of the samophlange, giving out small bits of knowledge on the device to those he trusted.  I wasn't one of the trusted few. . . Boss Copperplug used to stay at the Boulder Lode Mine in northeastern Barrens.  Get the manual from him, and if he's given pages from it to anyone, you'll have to collect them too. "
4437,The Runed Scroll,Take the Runed Scroll to the northern guard tower in the Barrens. ,"The official-looking scroll is wrapped tightly with a silvery ribbon. You're sure someone would be interested in seeing this, but who?

4438,The Barrens Oases,Speak with Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads in the Barrens. ,"The druids of Thunder Bluff sense a strange power leaking into the Barrens, east of Mulgore. Tonga Runetotem was sent to discover the source of this power, but we fear he will need aid. Travel to the Barrens and speak with Tonga.  He will be at the Crossroads.  To reach there, take the road east out of Bloodhoof village.  Enter the Barrens, then turn north when the road forks.  Continue north and  you will find the Crossroads. And do not leave the road, <name>, for the Barrens is a harsh land. "
4439,Horde Presence,"Kill the leader of the Talon Den, Rynthariel the Keymaster. ","This scroll is from that scheming dryad Rynthariel, Keymaster of the Talon Den on Stonetalon Peak. She'll not be making any more contact with the messenger you looted this from, heh, but we must stand our ground here. The Horde will not tolerate her outrunners here. <name>, travel to the Talon Den. Kill Rynthariel, and then put up a symbol for all to see. Take this Horde flag, <name>. Put it up in the Talon Den so that they will not be so rash as to send another messenger through our territory again. "
4440,Altered Beings,Bring 8 Altered Snapjaw Shells to Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads. ,"Your findings are incredible, <name>.  These oases hold properties that must come from an outside source.  Or perhaps an inside one. I want to know how these fissures are affecting the beasts who drink from the oases' water. Hunt oasis snapjaws at the Lushwater and Stagnant Oases.  Bring me their shells so I may examine them. "
4441,Counterattack! ,"Bring a Piece of Krom'zar's Banner to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads. ","The Horde commends your successes against the Kolkar, but the Kolkar themselves are maddened.  I have reports that a contingent of Kolkar has traveled to the Barrens from their home in Desolace, to seek vengeance.  My latest report was that, even now, they move against these bunkers, from the west! Face the Kolkar invaders, and end their threat in the Barrens.

4442,Lost in Battle,Find Mankrik's wife and then return to him in the Crossroads. ,"We battled in a small tauren camp when we were separated--she held three of the Bristlebacks off by herself. But the odds began to overwhelm us. I led some away only to see her overwhelmed by newcomers. In my rage, I turned to face my enemies, but they brought me down easily with their vast numbers. I awoke to a tauren druid tending my wounds--he had come across me on the Gold Road as I fell. Please, <class>, find some sign of my wife. "
4443,The Forgotten Pools,Report back to Tonga Runetotem with your findings. ,"Long ago, the Barrens was a lush place, teeming with life.  But war and cataclysm raged across the land, scorching it and leaving a dry husk.  Such is the way of things, and it saddens my heart. But within the past few years, new oases have formed in the Barrens, and life stirs.  And deep down, we druids sense a power leaking its way to the surface. We must find its source.  Travel to the Forgotten Pools, northwest of the Crossroads.  Search its waters for a source of power, then return here. "
4444,Gann's Reclamation,Gann Stonespire wants you to kill 15 Bael'dun Excavators and 5 Bael'dun Foremen. ,"In solitude I wander these roads. The dwarves of Bael Modan show no respect for my land. Horrendous blasts drive holes deep into the ground as noisy machines rip apart the hills. Lands which once served as home and provider to my tribe are now riddled with destructive dwarves. Attempts at reaching a diplomatic resolution have failed. Now is the time for decisive action. Drive the dwarves from the Bael Modan excavation by force and bring to me the journal of their leader, Prospector Khazgorm. "
4445,The Harvester,Bring the Harvester's Head to Jorn Skyseer. ,"This strange, insect-like creature looks outside of the natural order, as though it does not belong in the Barrens. "
4446,The Stagnant Oasis,"Return to Tonga at The Crossroads, after investigating the Stagnant Oasis. ","Like the one you found at the Forgotten Pools, there may be fissures at the other oases in the Barrens.  If so, then perhaps the fissures are the oases' source of life. We must test this. Here, take these seeds.  They are dead and infertile, but take them to the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast.  If there is a fissure there, then place the seeds within it. . . and observe. "
4447,The Guns of Northwatch,"Captain Thalo'thas Brightsun of Ratchet wants you to collect 10 Theramore Medals and slay Captain Fairmount, Cannoneer Whessan and Cannoneer Smythe.

4448,Sergra Darkthorn,Speak with Sergra Darkthorn at the Crossroads in the Barrens. ,"If you wish to walk the hunter's path, then your journey leads to the Barrens.  Its beasts are strong-willed and fierce.  You will learn much by hunting there, and your spirit will grow. Speak with Sergra Darkthorn.  She will be your first guide in the Barrens. Sergra is at the Crossroads.  To reach her, travel east from Bloodhoof Village into the Barrens, then north as the road forks.  And have care as you travel-- the Barrens holds great danger for the unprepared and unwary. "
4449,Raptor Horns,"Gather 5 Intact Raptor Horns from Sunscale Scytheclaws, and bring them to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet. ","The raptors of the Barrens are smarter than raptors in other lands.  And I think all that smarts is hiding in their horns!  If so, then I could grind their horns into powder and use it to make ""smart drinks. ""  I could sell them for a fortune! ! !

4450,Prowlers of the Barrens,Collect 7 Prowler Claws from Savannah Prowlers for Sergra Darkthorn in the Crossroads. ,"Now it's time to go after something that really bites.  The prowlers of the Barrens are a tough breed.  Tough, resourceful, sly. . . and deadly.  You'll find them among the tall grasses.  You'll find many to the southwest of the Crossroads. Be wary as you hunt them, <name>, or you may find yourself no longer the predator, but instead the prey. "
4451,Chen's Empty Keg,"Bring 5 Savannah Lion Tusks, 5 Plainstrider Kidneys, and 1 Thunder Lizard Horn to Brewmaster Drohn in Ratchet. ","Would you like a taste of Chen's namesake? Ahh, the stormstout is a mighty brew. Chen taught the recipe to my mentor, and my mentor passed it on to me. I'll need you to get me a few things, but I can tell you this: the kick is worth it. Bring me 5 savannah lion tusks from any savannah lion, 5 plainstrider kidneys from any plainstrider, and 1 thunder lizard horn from any species of thunder lizard. That should do the trick nicely. You can find these ingredients throughout the Barrens. "
4452,Blood Shards of Agamaggan,Bring a Blood Shard to Mangletooth in Camp Taurajo in the Barrens. ,"Along with the thorns, the blood affected <snort> other aspects of the earth: blood red stones mixed in with other minerals. The Bristleback dig up these shards and carry them as totems <snort> for strength in battle and as totems for their magics. <snort>I know the secrets of that magic. Bring Mangletooth one of these blood shards to show you understand. Bring Mangletooth many of the shards, and he will bless you with quilboar magic--the magic of Agamaggan! <snort>"
4453,Chen's Empty Keg,"Bring 5 Lightning Glands, 1 Thunderhawk Saliva Gland and 1 Kodo Liver to Brewmaster Drohn in Ratchet. ","Good stuff, that stormstout, huh?

Bring me 5 lightning glands from any stormhide, 1 thunderhawk saliva gland from greater thunderhawks, and a kodo liver from any of the Barrens ' kodos. Like I said, this stuff has kick; it's the trogg brew that I mentioned to you before. "
4454,In Nightmares,Bring the Nightmare Shard to Hamuul Runetotem on Elder Rise. ,"This shard holds great secrets; it is the pure essence of the Emerald Dream. However, what I see in this shard is not a dream; one would call this sort of a vision a nightmare. I do not wish to alarm you, <name>, but I think it is best if you deliver this shard into the hands of a wise druid as soon as you can. Hamuul Runetotem on Elder Rise is who you need to find. Head to Thunder Bluff. I cannot say more. "
4455,Mura Runetotem,Speak with Mura Runetotem at the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest. ,"My clanmate, Mura Runetotem, traveled to Silverpine so that she might aid our undead allies.  Silverpine is an ailing forest, a dying forest, and it was Mura's hope to bring it new life.  Perhaps the strange life found here in the Barrens can help her work in Silverpine. Take a sample of the shells you gathered, and bring it to Mura in Silverpine.  She is staying at the Sepulcher.  With luck, studying the shell will give her the insight she needs to heal that dying place. "
4456,Disrupt the Attacks,"Of the Razormane tribe, kill 8 Water Seekers, 8 Thornweavers and 3 Hunters, and then return to Thork in the Crossroads. ","All the quilboars are our enemies, <name>. Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others. The Razormane tribe has been attacking our supply lines from Durotar, causing us no end of annoyance. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us. Start in the northeast towards Durotar. You can always tell their dens from the huge thorny vines that come up from the earth. Seek them out, and slay them. "
4457,Miner's Fortune,Retrieve the Cats Eye Emerald from one of the Venture Co. ,"Being Wharfmaster of a busy port like Ratchet, I keep my finger on the pulse of information. I know all about the exchange of goods and money between here and Booty Bay. The latest bit of news I've heard is about the Venture Company's Boulder Lode mine northeast of the Sludge Fen. One of the miners discovered an emerald the size of your fist. I know a few buyers who'd be interested in getting their hands on something like that, and I'd be willing to go half and half on its sale. "
4458,Mahren Skyseer,Speak with Mahren Skyseer. ,"You have hunted the beasts of the Barrens.  Your spirit is strong.  But a hunter must always be prepared.  A true hunter can stalk prey down any path.  Mountains and swamps will not sway <him/her>. Not even the sea. Find my sister, Mahren.  She hunts the great water beasts along the coast.  She will be your teacher in their ways. But be wary in your search for her, for the Barrens ' coast is held by humans. "
4459,Supplies for the Crossroads,Find and return Crossroads' Supply Crates to Thork in the Barrens. ,"That attack on the caravan contained supplies we desperately needed. You've been brave enough to take on the Razormane tribe so far, and I will ask you to do so again, but this time, I wonder if I could ask you to keep your eyes open for some of our lost supplies. You can probably find them throughout their camps, the quilboar getting fat off their dishonorable acts. The people of the Crossroads would be in your debt. "
4460,The Disruption Ends,"Kill 8 Razormane Geomancers, 8 Razormane Defenders, and Kreenig Snarlsnout. ","One of my scouts witnessed an attack on a caravan from Durotar, <name>. The culprits are indeed the Razormane tribe of quilboars. One of the quilboars in particular is leading the raids: Kreenig Snarlsnout. He was seen northeast of here, just south of the road from Durotar. If the threat is to be ended, then Kreenig must die. To be sure the attacks cease, though, I say we add insult to their injury. Kill Kreenig along with more of their tribe, and return to me when you have his tusk. "
4461,Cry of the Thunderhawk,"Find and slay a Thunderhawk, return its wings to Jorn Skyseer at Camp Taurajo. ","The thunderhawk, <name>, is a fierce beast.  It is time for you to face them.

4462,Samophlange,Access the control console at the Venture Company research site. ,"The Venture Company set up a small research facility far to the north of here, southwest of the Sludge Fen. I don't know very much about what they're doing, but did manage to discover that they're experimenting with something called a ""samophlange"". Now what the heck is a samophlange? Well, whatever it is, I want to examine it, so I need someone to go get it. I obtained a copy of their control system operating manual, you should be able to figure out how to disengage the samophlange from it. "

","The Razormane quilboars to the south, beyond the Field of Giants, have no skilled blacksmiths from what I am told, but they've apparently started to develop sturdier weapons. I'd like to get my hands on a few different types to learn their techniques if possible. If you wish to help bring honor to the Horde, then bring me examples of their weapons. Find me a dagger from their stalkers, a wand from their seers, and a shield from their warfrenzy. That should do nicely! "
4465,Serena Bloodfeather,Slay Serena Bloodfeather and return her head to Darsok Swiftdagger at the Crossroads. ,"You did so well with the lieutenants and underlings that I'd like you to do one last thing for me. Serena Bloodfeather is the sister of a harpy named Bloodfeather who was slain by Rexxar quite a while ago. Apparently, these attacks on the Horde caravans are revenge for her sister's death. I need you to slit her throat and bring me back her head. I want to place it on the next caravan we send out. . . Give those harpies something to think about. "
4466,The Ashenvale Hunt,"Speak with Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale. ","Your strength impresses me, <class>.  Your willingness to embrace the hunt gives me confidence that you could move on to bigger game. . . and bigger challenges. The forests of Ashenvale represent a vast untamed wild that the Horde seeks to impose its own will upon, both politically and spiritually.  If you seek to prove yourself in an unproven land, seek the guidance of Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post.  The outpost is due north of the path leading from the Barrens. "

Both tribes are very spiritual--tied to the earth and its power. <snort> It gives us strength in all things. . . especially war. If you want to find out who really causes Thork <snort> and the Horde such anguish, then help Mangletooth! You attack the spiritual leaders of the Bristlebacks to the north; weaken them so the Razormanes can defeat them and rule the Barrens. "
4468,A New Ore Sample,Find an Unrefined Ore Sample on a Gravelsnout Digger or Surveyor and bring it to Tatternack Steelforge at Camp Taurajo in the Barrens. ,"<class>, you have done well in helping me in the past. The warchief is pleased thus far with what I've accomplished, and asks me to continue with renewed determination. My honor dictates that I give you proper recognition to the warchief for all you have done, but first I would ask you for your help again. Travelers recently came from the south from a place called Thousand Needles. There they killed a kobold who had an unusual ore sample, but they would not sell it. I want a sample of that ore to examine. "
4469,The Swarm Grows,Deliver Korran's Sealed Note to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar. ,"Many travelers who've come through the Crossroads helped me gather eggs from the Field of Giants, and many of them have tales of how deadly the creatures are. I've heard enough to consider them insects a much larger threat than my masters first thought. I need a courier to travel to Orgrimmar to meet Belgrom Rockmaul. It be no simple matter, and someone who would take the task seriously should go. Belgrom usually be found outside the warriors' guild house. "
4470,Deepmoss Spider Eggs,Bring 15 Deepmoss Eggs to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet. ,"Spider egg omelettes are a new fad in Booty Bay!  The problem is. . . Booty Bay's got no eggs. I smell an opportunity! In Windshear Crag and Sishir Canyon, in the Stonetalon Mountains to the northwest, lives the deepmoss spider.  Bring me its eggs and I'll pay a bundle! In Windshear Crag, the eggs will be clustered under what trees remain. In Sishir Canyon. . . well, if you have a weak stomach then maybe you should just collect the eggs at Windshear Crag. . . "
4471,Plainstrider Menace,Collect 7 Plainstrider Beaks and return them to Sergra Darkthorn in the Crossroads. ,Your first prey will be easy. The plainstriders to the east have been harassing our food supplies and have become a nuisance. Put down the plainstriders and return to me with their beaks.

Her inn is in the Valley of Strength, not far from the Skytower, where my wind rider will drop you off. Speak with me again when you are ready for the journey. "
4475,Ziz Fizziks,Speak with Ziz Fizziks in Windshear Crag in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"The Venture Company stole many of the best goblin minds, but from time to time, we get the opportunity to steal some back. A while ago, the Venture Company outfit in the Stonetalon Mountains hired Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle--a gnome! Their other engineer, Ziz Fizziks, was so taken aback by this, he pleaded with me to find him new employment with the Tinkers' Union. I set him on a few tasks, but he might need help. Maybe you could look in on him for me? He's stationed at the western edge of Windshear Crag. "
4476,The Escape,Protect Wizzlecrank and the stolen goblin shredder on the way to Sputtervalve in Ratchet. ,"I suppose I'll learn as we go. . . Couldn't be too hard. Just some buttons here, and a lever or two. . . Well, are you ready to go? "
4477,Stolen Booty,Retrieve the Shipment of Boots and Telescopic Lens for Gazlowe in Ratchet. ,"While I'd like to recover all my goods, I'm sure that's not possible. Still, there's a few things that I absolutely must have! As you see, my observatory is ready to go, but it needs the smaller of the two lenses. The first arrived by caravan from Durotar, but the second was bound by ship, and never arrived. Also, I never got my boot shipment from Drizzlik in Booty Bay! Head down to the pirate camp and see if you can find them. "
4478,Revenge of Gann,Destroy the flying machine at Bael Modan and return to Gann Stonespire. ,"Following Khazgorm's plans it should be no problem to fashion an explosive chargeAh, there we go. Now, <name>, I am going to entrust you with a special task. Take this explosive stick and use it to blow up the flying machine at Bael Modan. Not only is the flying machine a key part of the site's infrastructure it also serves as a weapon of war. More importantly it is an icon of power and an insult to the memory of my tribe. Make me proud by completing this heroic task and you shall be rewarded. "
4479,Raptor Thieves,Bring 12 Raptor Heads to Gazrog at the Crossroads. ,"Not long ago, a shipment of silver was stolen from our guard tower.  It was meant as payroll to the Crossroads' guards, and we want that silver back. The strange thing is. . . we caught one of the thieves on the night of the theft.  And. . . it was a raptor!  Unbelievable! I don't know what raptors would want with silver.  But I don't care -- I want the raptors dead so they won't steal from us again! Hunt raptors in the Barrens.  Collect for me their heads! "
4480,Agamaggan's Agility,"My tribes greatest scouts are said to be unrivaled in their accuracy, and no rogue &lt; snort&gt; could measure up to their quickness in battle.

I ran out of seventeen-point-five gauge nugget slugs and I'm going to need a bunch of those for the work ahead. The closest place to get them is the Sludge Fen to the east.

4484,Southsea Freebooters,Kill 12 Southsea Brigands and 6 Southsea Cannoneers for Gazlowe in Ratchet. ,"I sure wish Vice Admiral Grezzlik did a better job of keeping the seas safe for our trading vessels. With all the gold the trade princes have poured into the Trade Fleets, it ticks me off to see so many pirates running willy-nilly, raiding my ships and stealing my goods! I heard that the Southsea Freebooters have set up a camp just south of here. They've been a real thorn in my side and if Grezzlik won't take care of them, well, maybe you can help me get rid of them. "
4485,Enraged Thunder Lizards,Bring 3 Thunder Lizard Blood to Jorn Skyseer at Camp Taurajo. ,"Now, <name>, you must face the great thunder lizards.  So large are the beasts, the ground rumbles as they stomp across the plains.  Take care as you fight them, for one false step and you may find yourself beneath their feet.

4486,Wenikee Boltbucket,Bring the Broken Samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket. ,"I think I might have broken that Samophlange.  That's not good, because I already told some colleagues in Undermine about it and they were very intrigued.  We must find a way to fix it! Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of Mor'shan Rampart, the horde outpost between the Barrens and Ashenvale.  She is very clever and inquisitive.

4487,Letter to Jin'Zil,"Deliver Darsok's letter to Jin'Zil within his cave in Malaka'Jin, in Stonetalon. ","You've done so well for me, <name>. You're a regular lucky rabbit's foot and there's something I want you to see. The harpies are not from around the Barrens. They come from a place called Stonetalon, far to the northwest of here. Though it is probably a dangerous place for you, I need this letter delivered to an old friend of mine who lives there, a witch doctor by the name of Jin'Zil. He'll be happy to know that Serena Bloodfeather is dead, and I think you'll find Stonetalon an interesting place. "
4488,Apothecary Zamah,"Bring the Rendered Spores to Apothecary Zamah in Thunder Bluff, before the time limit is up. ","I have rendered the spores you gave me into an emulsion.  I must now send it to my associate, Apothecary Zamah.  If you were to carry this to her, she can offer you something from our stores of alchemical goods. She is in the Pools of Vision, a cave beneath the shamans of Thunder Bluff.  The path to this cave is well hidden, but you may find it on the Spirit Rise bluff. Do hurry.  This emulsion will maintain its potency for only a short time, and must be resealed and processed before then. "
4489,Mending Old Wounds,"You'd better think twice before setting foot in Ratchet, &lt; name&gt; ! &nbsp; Word's been getting around of your dirty deeds. ","I'm happy you're seeing the error of your ways, <name>.  Keep the supplies coming; we're not going to forget about you so easily, mister! "
4490,Kolkar Leaders,"Bring Barak's Head to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads. ","The centaurs have plagued the Tauren for years.  And recently, the Kolkar centaurs of the Barrens have grown into a real threat.  Normally they were disorganized in these lands, but new leaders have risen among them.  Rallying them. To preserve our holdings here, these centaur leaders must be destroyed. Bring me the head of Barak Kodobane.  He camps near the Forgotten Pools to the north. Defeat him, then return to me. "
4491,Egg Hunt,Bring 12 Silithid Eggs and the Digging Claw to Korran at the Crossroads. ,"Hey, <name>. I been sent to the Crossroads to watch over the land and take note of its happenings for my masters in Orgrimmar. One object of my studies are the insect-like creatures found to the south in the Field of Giants. We know little of the creatures, so I be makin' it a point to discover more. They seem to have intelligence to them, more so than any normal animal. Take this digging claw and collect some of the creatures' eggs from their mounds, but be careful: if alerted, they will attack you. "
4492,Harpy Lieutenants,Collect 6 Harpy Lieutenant Rings from Witchwing Slayers and return them to Darsok Swiftdagger at the Crossroads. ,"Hahaha, <name>. Back for more? Good, I like to hear that. This time I want you to assassinate some of the harpy lieutenants in the Dry Hills. Only Witchwing Slayers can be lieutenants, and you can tell them apart by the rings they carry. They are a nasty bunch, but they lead some of the underlings in that area. Taking out 6 of them will be a decisive strike against their matriarchy. Make sure they die painfully, <name>. We want those harpy wenches to know the idiocy of picking fights with the Horde. "
4493,Fungal Spores,Bring 4 Fungal Spores to Apothecary Helbrim at the Crossroads. ,"The oases of the Barrens hide a mystery.  Life energy flows from their waters, invigorating the plants and beasts that drink it. Invigorating, and altering. There is a mushroom that grows near these oases.  Its spores hold properties that we, the apothecaries of Lordaeron, find useful. Bring me these spores and you will earn our gratitude. "
4494,Rilli Greasygob,Bring the Broken and Battered Samophlange to Rilli Greasygob in Orgrimmar. ,"Well, that didn't work.  I put some extra gauges on the samophlange to measure its structural integrity, and they read the integrity at an all-time low.  I could add some more dials and maybe a lever or two to try and fix it, but. . . I think that might make things even worse. You should take the samophlange to Rilli Greasygob.  He used to work for the Venture Company -- if anyone knows how to fix it, it's Rilli. You can find him at Nogg's Machine Shop in Orgrimmar, in the Valley of Honor. "
4495,Samophlange,Return the Samophlange to Sputtervalve in Ratchet. ,"Pulling open the face of the control console reveals a dense jumble of wires, tubing and other strange mechanical objects--most of which seem to serve no practical purpose.

4496,Consumed by Hatred,Bring 60 Bristleback Quilboar Tusks to Mankrik at the Crossroads. ,"Perhaps you know the pain of uncertainty, perhaps not, <class>. But know this: I stand here every day, from the sun's rising till its decline, scouring the horizon for more of those monsters. I've killed every pig man I've come across since, but my thirst for their blood is far from quenched. Perhaps instead of heading north to the Crossroads I should have headed to Taurajo. You, <class>--you  could help me. Kill them. Kill as many as you can. Bring me their tusks, and we will celebrate their deaths together. "
4497,Return to the Crossroads. ,"Buy a wind rider to the Crossroads from the wind rider master Doras, then bring Gryshka's Letter to Zargh at the Crossroads.

Speak with me when you are ready to go. "
4498,In Nightmares,Bring the Nightmare Shard to Mathrengyl Bearwalker in Darnassus. ,"This shard holds great secrets; it is the pure essence of the Emerald Dream. However, what I see in this shard is not a dream; one would call this sort of a vision a nightmare. I do not wish to alarm you, <name>, but I think it is best if you deliver this shard into the hands of a wise druid as soon as you can. . . Mathrengyl Bearwalker in the Cenarion Circle is who you need to find. Head to Darnassus. I cannot say more. "

4501,Revenge of Gann,"Gann Stonespire wants you to bring him 6 vials of Nitroglycerin, 6 bundles of Wood Pulp, and 6 samples of Sodium Nitrate. ","It is clear the prospector depended on explosives and those noisy vehicles to rip the ground apart. We can expect a new foreman to take over soon. I want to give the dwarves a taste of their own medicine. According to these plans if we combine nitroglycerin with wood pulp and sodium nitrate we can create an explosive charge. The rifleman, soldiers and officers in the Keep are known to have the supplies. Collect these items and bring them to me. I will fashion a charge that the dwarves won't forget! "
4502,The Tear of the Moons,Feegly the Exiled wants you to retrieve for him the Tear of the Moons. ,"The power was mine! In my very hands! And I want it back! Back I say! Those dirty excavators uncovered it. . . so beautiful it was. Deemed the Tear of the Moons, it was the first great discovery we made at Bael Modan. It should have been mine! Mine I say! General Twinbraid grew jealous of the power it gave me. He locked it away in the Keep. Called it cursed, he did! The fool! Others wanted it and they had to be stopped! That fiend Twinbraid drove me off. Now I want it back. Back I say! "
4503,Harpy Raiders,Collect 8 Witchwing talons. ,"The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers. I've been snooping around their nests and figured out who leads who. The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top. I'll start you off slow, take out Witchwing Harpies and Witchwing Roguefeathers in the Northwest and bring me 8 Witchwing talons. That should be a good start. . . "
4504,Meats to Orgrimmar,Bring Zargh's Meats to Devrak in the Crossroads. ,"I have some choice cuts of meat that I want to send to a friend.  Her name is Gryshka, the innkeeper in Orgrimmar.

4507,Wharfmaster Dizzywig,Bring the Secure Crate to Wharfmaster Dizzywig in Ratchet. ,"I have need to send a crate of potions, reagents and other items to my associates in the Old World. Little time I have to actually see them to the dock at Ratchet, and the last caravan has already left. If you could, please take this to Wharfmaster Dizzywig.

The horde has recently set up an outpost on the Zoram Strand there, and we can always use some new recruits to help defend our new fronts.

","In order to fly to a town, you must have already been there and spoken with the wind rider master of that town.

A colleague there, Ahanu, will use the hides to create leather goods. Will you take the hides to him for me? The quickest way to Thunder Bluff is on the back of a wind rider.  Bring the bundle of hides to Devrak, our wind rider master in the Crossroads, and speak to him about transport to Thunder Bluff. "
4512,Ride to Thunder Bluff,"Buy a wind rider to Thunder Bluff from the wind rider master Devrak, then bring the Bundle of Hides to Ahanu in Thunder Bluff. ","For a small fee, I will give you a wind rider to Thunder Bluff.  There's no faster way to the city! If that is acceptable, speak to me again when you are ready to go. If you're taking those hides to Ahanu, then I think he's at Hewa's Armory, at the base of the wind rider tower in Thunder Bluff.  And that's right where you'll land! "

Don't worry -- we'll send you against bigger prey in good time, but for now your teeth could use a little more cutting. Hunt the zhevra to the north and south, and collect their hooves.

4527,A Donation of Runecloth,We are currently gathering runecloth. ,"Our thanks for your donation. Should you continue to offer runecloth, I will make certain that word of your good works reaches the leaders of the Exodar. "
4528,A Donation of Mageweave,We are currently gathering mageweave. ,"Our thanks for your donation, <name>. "
4529,Assisting Arch Druid Staghelm,Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus. ,"Excuse me <class>, but I'd like just a moment of your time if possible. The Cenarion Circle in Darnassus is looking for seasoned adventurers such as yourself to lend them aid in a vital research project.  While I do not know the specifics, I can inform you that none other than Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm is spearheading this research. Please - if you are interested, speak with him directly in the Cenarion Enclave within Darnassus proper. "
4530,Final Passage,Speak to Dorn Plainstalker in Thousand Needles. ,"You have done well, <name>. You have passed my test, and the tests before mine. Return to Dorn in Thousand Needles. He will sense the change within you, and see that your mind, body and spirit are strong enough that you should be rewarded for your efforts. Stay true to the balance you've shown throughout these trials, <name>. Dorn will test you again in the future if you do. "
4531,A Dip in the Moonwell,Use the Robotron Control while standing near the Concealed Command Console hidden in a small cluster of bushes on the rim of the needle closest to Thalanaar to take command of a Robotron 3000. ,"Stop looking at me like that! I didn't say I was going to send you to Thalanaar's moonwell out in the open with dipper and a flask! I've been, err. . . tinkering with a product I was transporting for a client. In fact, I've already set up a portable control console for the Robotron out near Thalanaar. You'll need to bring this control unit with you and use it in the vicinity of my concealed console. If my client ever heard that I so much as removed Robotron from its packaging, he'd hang me by my ears! "
4532,Test of Lore,Answer Parqual Fintallas' question successfully and then speak to him again. ,"So the time is once again upon us. As a student of lore, you have shown great tenacity by undertaking my task. And so now I offer you your question. If you are ready, speak to me again, and take all the time you need, <name>--there is no pressure to answer quickly. "
4533,Test of Faith,"If you have faith, leap from the planks overlooking Thousand Needles. ","So, you have sought me out, or perhaps destiny brings you to me? No matter. You are here now, and so your journey will begin anew. Many facets make up a being: the spirit, the body, the mind. Some of these can be measured by a culture's traditions. Others we can only hope exist within ourselves. If you agree, I shall test some of the facets within you. If you pass, then you shall become stronger. If you fail, then you will realize the vastness of the Nether. The first is a Test of Faith. "
4534,Test of Strength,Bring Fragments of Rok'Alim to Dorn Plainstalker in Thousand Needles. ,"During the time of the Old Gods, elementals inhabited much of this world. They worshipped the Old Gods, and the Gods, through their power, kept the elementals bound to this world. When the Old Gods were banished, the elementals faded from our world and now only return at the bidding of powerful mages. There are exceptions though. Some elementals were powerful enough to remain here on their own. One such elemental is Rok'Alim. To test your strength, find Rok'Alim in Thousand Needles and slay him. "
4535,Test of Lore,Answer Braug Dimspirit's question successfully and then speak to him again. ,"You have brought me the book, and now it is time for your question. Are you ready? Time is not an issue, <class>, so do not feel pressured. You may take as long as you like to answer. "
4536,Test of Lore,Find the Legacy of the Aspects and return it to Braug Dimspirit near the entrance to Talondeep Path in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"You have passed Dorn's tests, and now you seek to pass your next trial. Very good. But up until now, your challenges have been childish. It is easy to test your body--your mind is another matter completely. I shall explain it simply: find the book I name, study it, and answer my question about its contents. What book, you must be asking? The Legacy of the Aspects. It can be found at the bottom of Dor'danil in southern Ashenvale, protected by the dead druids and their slayers. "
4537,Lonebrow's Journal,Read Henrig Lonebrow's Journal. ,You slowly open the weathered journal of Henrig Lonebrow. . . . 
4538,Grimtotem Spying,Locate and retrieve the three Secret Notes in Darkcloud Pinnacle. ,"<name>, you have served us well in the past, so I now entrust to you an important mission. The Grimtotem Clan is up to something secretive. Three agents of unknown origin were seen visiting the Grimtotem over the recent weeks. We discovered that separate chests in Darkcloud Pinnacle hold these guarded messages. <name>, if you succeed in this dangerous mission, I will reward you in kind. "
4539,Test of Lore,Find Braug Dimspirit near the entrance to Talondeep Path in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"Your time with me is just about finished. I am knowledgeable, but the Test of Lore is not mine to give. There are lessons to be learned and places to visit that others claim domain over. If you are prepared, then seek out Braug Dimspirit --he is a shaman of great wisdom. He will test you further, so heed his words, <name>. When you are ready, find the tunnel that connects the Stonetalon Mountains with Ashenvale: Braug dwells near there. And be careful, <name>, the night elves may wish to impede your test. "
4540,Test of Endurance,Bring Grenka's Claw to Dorn Plainstalker in Thousand Needles. ,"I'm pleased to see your courage remains steadfast in light of what you've already done. Since your faith is intact, the time has come to test your body. First is a test of endurance. Go to the Roguefeather Den west of Freewind Post. Make your way to the depths of their lair and destroy their foodstuffs. By then you should have provoked their fury, and if you are able to survive long enough, Grenka Bloodscreech herself will come for you--kill her and bring me her claw to complete your test. "
4541,Test of Lore,Find Parqual Fintallas in Undercity. ,"Well done, <name>. You have passed the first portion of the Test of Lore, but there is still another question to be answered. But that question is not mine to ask. Seek out Parqual Fintallas in Lordaeron City. He was a great historian for the humans before the Plague overtook him. Now he continues to seek enlightenment, but of a different nature. He will have another requirement of you before he asks you anything, but you have done masterfully thus far--I'm sure you will overcome his obstacle. "
4542,Razzeric's Tweaking,Retrieve the Seaforium Booster for Razzeric in the Shimmering Flats. ,"Pozzik's a great mechanic, I know that, but he's afraid to just load on the firepower and grab on for the ride. Not me, though. After Pozzik finishes with a racer, I take a little time to put my own modifications on--you know, loosening up the controls, removing parts of the frame, and adding more juice! I ordered a seaforium booster from Shreev at the Gizmorium in Gadgetzan, but apparently the zeppelin it was being sent on crashed in Dustwallow Marsh! I gotta have it, <name>! "
4543,A Bump in the Road,"Kill 10 Saltstone Basilisks, 10 Saltstone Crystalhides and 6 Saltstone Gazers for Trackmaster Zherin on the Shimmering Flats. ","After the big crash with the goblins' Red Thunder racer and a basilisk, Kronkrider hired me on to take care of the track. I don't know what all the animals out on the flats are feeding on to grow so big, but we have to be careful to thin them out so they won't wander onto the track when a race is going on. Tell you what. If you want to go out and make a little profit, go out and remove the basilisks from the area. "
4544,Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem,Slay Arnak Grimtotem and bring proof of your deed to Cliffwatcher Longhorn in Freewind Post. ,Wanted: Arnak GrimtotemArnak the outcast is wanted for the heinous crimes of murder and kidnapping. Handsome rewards will be given to those brave enough to bring this criminal to justice. Arnak was last seen on the cliffs near the Darkcloud Pinnacle. Show the proof of your deed to Cliffwatcher Longhorn in Freewind Post in order to claim the reward. 
4545,Goblin Sponsorship,Bring the Fuel Regulator Blueprints to Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay. ,"See, the Venture Company shredders out in Lake Nazferiti (in northern Stranglethorn) have been equipped with a new model fuel regulator. I was thinking that Pozzik would be able to take advantage of it, if he could get some details. Unfortunately, Cozzle, the foreman out there, appears to be a little more clever than I gave him credit for. You seem like you might have more luck finding the blueprints though. I know he keeps them in his house, but they're almost certainly under lock and key. "
4546,Indurium Ore,"I'd like to integrate indurium into different parts of our racers, but I need large amounts of raw indurium to create these parts. ",Excellent! I'll get the crew to work right away on the parts we'll need for the next race. 
4547,The Rumormonger,Talk to Krazek at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale. ,"Now that we've done a service for the gnomes, it's time to do the goblins a favor! I hear that the goblin racer pilot, Nazz Steamboil, didn't always use that name.  I wonder why he changed it.  I wonder if it's a secret, and. . . I wonder if he values that secret. If anyone knows the truth, then it's Krazek of Booty Bay, on the southern tip of Stranglethorn.  Speak with Krazek and ask him about our goblin pilot. If you can get useful information from him, then we might just turn a profit from it. "
4548,The Brassbolts Brothers,Speak with Wizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats. ,"Have you met the Brassbolts brothers?  They're over in the Shimmering Flats, in Kalimdor, racing their rocket car against the goblins.  They usually win which is no surprise--the goblin car blows up so much it barely ever crosses the finish line! But even then, the Brassbolts brothers are always looking for new ways to make their car go faster, and Wizzle told me he needs a very rare component for his next experiment. He probably needs help getting that part.  Speak to him and find out. "
4549,Keeping Pace,"Have Zamek create a diversion, then steal Rizzle's plans for Pozzik on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ","The Brassbolts brothers have discovered a new building material, that's the only explanation that makes sense. Their cars have been operating faster than before, but their designs, and all the other data we've gathered from their runs is identical. What we do know, is that Rizzle Brassbolts has been focused on the plans for this new discovery almost constantly. Zamek can create a diversion for you, so that you can steal those plans from them. "
4550,Martek the Exiled,Bring Fizzle's Letter to Martek the Exiled in the Badlands. ,"I'm developing a new engine that'll make the car go so fast!  Fast enough to fly, I know it!  I just need to make pistons that can handle very very heavy stress.  All my trials have failed because I can't make pistons hard enough! But there is someone who might know how. His name is Martek the Exiled.  He is a great smith and knows more about metal than anyone.  Take him this letter, I know he can help! But he's far far away -- in Azeroth, in the Badlands, in a camp, with a goblin! Find him! "
4551,Sacred Fire,"Gather 10 bushels of Incendia Agave, and then consult Magatha Grimtotem on Elder Rise in Thunderbluff. ","Arikara is a deadly creature that must be dealt with swiftly. In order to hunt her down you will need to light the sacred fire of life - this will summon Arikara. Go now and harvest the rare Incendia agave plant. Once you have harvested enough agave, seek council with Magatha Grimtotem on Elder Rise in Thunder Bluff. She is a powerful shaman that can enchant the agave plant to create a powder that will light the fire. Travel northeast to the Boiling Pool and gather Incendia agave. "
4552,Safety First,Return the Modified Seaforium Booster to Razzeric on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ,"There, I did what Razzeric wanted. Just tell him to be careful when he sets this off. If he makes the slightest mistake, he won't be moving forward, he'll just be a burnt spot on the track. Would be a shame, too, if that happened. Who knows if our nineteenth driver would be any good? "
4553,Rumors for Kravel,Bring the Goblin Rumors to Kravel Koalbeard on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ,"I had to use some of my favors, and gave away a rare bottle of elven wine, and did some heavy deducing myself!  But I found the information you seek. Here, I wrote a letter with some very interesting bits on our friend, Nazz Steamboil.  Do with it what you will -- it's too dangerous for me to use. Just don't tell anyone where you got it! "
4554,Free at Last,"Escort Lakota Windsong from the Darkcloud Pinnacle, and then talk to Thalia Amberhide at Freewind Post. ","Arnak thinks we're going to be married. . . but after I declined his offer he came back that night and kidnapped me. My brother tried to stop him, but Arnak was too strong. He. . . he slew my brother and then brought me here.  My poor brother. . . <name>, could you escort me out of the Darkcloud Pinnacle?  Please. . . I need to get back to Thalia! She must be worried sick about me. "
4555,Alien Egg,Return the Alien Egg to Hagar Lightninghoof in Freewind Post. ,"A rumor has surfaced about an alien egg here in Thousand Needles. Those that report seeing this egg have failed to even get close enough to examine it in detail. Serpents guard the egg as if it's one of their own. I want you to seek out this alien egg and bring it to me so that I may examine it. Reports say the egg is located within a serpent den, but there are several serpent dens along the base of the cliff walls south and northeast of Freewind Post. "
4556,The Swarm Grows,"Kill 5 Silithid Searchers, 5 Silithid Hive Drones, and 5 Silithid Invaders and return to Moktar Krin in Thousand Needles. ",Hmm. Seems Belgrom thinks those monsters are a threat. He wants them pushed back into whatever depths they crawled up out of. I guess killing the dwarves sent by the Explorers' League wasn't enough--now I have to send a half-dead war party into another battle. We won't be able to do it ourselves; not while we're in this condition. The dig site's to the south of here. There shouldn't be anymore dwarves to deal with. Feel up to wielding a blade or staff and doing your part to aid us? 
4557,Report Back to Fizzlebub,Bring the Fool's Stout report to Crank Fizzlebub at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale. ,"That Fool's Stout worked great!  I placed a bet on the next race, and. . . let's hope the crew you got drunk did a number on their car! There's only one more task for you -- take this note back to Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay.  He'll want to know of the successful test. And hopefully we can get more of that Fool's Stout for future races! "
4558,Arikara,Slay Arikara. ,"Take this refined and purified Incendia powder to Thousand Needles and toss it on the sacred fire of life. It is located in the Darkcloud Pinnacle on an isolated needle where they bury their dead. The enchantment that I have weaved into the Incendia powder will summon Arikara to you, <name>. I fear she may be stalking Cairne Bloodhoof; too much Tauren lore has changed, and I fear this has angered Arikara. Move quickly before all is lost, <class>! "
4559,Assassination Plot,Warn Kanati Greycloud at Whitereach Post of the plot to kill him. ,"The Tauren, Kanati Greycloud is bold to set up a hunting camp in Thousand Needles. We must kill him to rid this hunting camp and all who may follow him. We will converge at the small post Southwest of the Great Lift. "
4560,Load Lightening,Get 10 Hollow Vulture Bones for Pozzik in the Shimmering Flats. ,"When it comes to racing, every bit counts! Whether it's a minor tweaking on the power output, a slight slackening on the tension coils, or lightening the weight of the frame, you have to take everything into account. We use vulture bones for a lot of the minor structural tweaks we make to our racers, which offer the perfect balance of strength and weight. Even better, it's easy for us to get more, as the salt flats are littered with vultures. Bring me some and I'll give you a good price on them. "
4561,Hypercapacitor Gizmo,Slay the beast and bring back the Hypercapacitor Gizmo and Panther Cage Key to Wizlo Bearingshiner. ,"I am the only survivor from our caravan attack by the centaur! A rare yet mighty panther is guarding my best gizmo, which is around his neck. Hah! Even the centaur tremble in the presence of this ferocious beast! Here is the key to the cage. They took everything there, but left him alone. Slay this beast and bring back my hypercapacitor, and I shall reward you. The wrecked caravan is just north of here. "
4562,Parts of the Swarm,"Bring 1 Silithid Heart, 5 Silithid Talons, and 3 Intact Silithid Carapaces, to Korran at the Crossroads. ","You inspect the carapace carefully. As you turn it over in your hands you realize that the chitinous plating is interlaced in such a way that makes it incredibly strong. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. You inspect the rest of the corpse further and realize that these creatures are very powerful and highly evolved. Looking down at the carapace again, you think that Korran would enjoy studying more of these creatures. It could help him figure out what these creatures are, and where they come from. "
4563,Zamek's Distraction,Let's go! A level 41 Thousand Needles Quest. ,Let's go! 
4564,Protect Kanati Greycloud,Protect Kanati Greycloud from the centaur attack. ,"But, there may be more centaur than I thought, I ask you, <name>, to fight with me against these vile assassins. "
4565,Safety First,Bring the Seaforium Booster to Shreev at Gadgetzan in Tanaris. ,"But wait, what's this? Shreev left the safety on. That will limit the amount of power I can draw from the booster at any time. I told him I wanted it off! This is no good. You have to take this to the Gadgetzan Gizmorium in the Tanaris Desert and have Shreev remove this. "
4566,Rizzle's Schematics,Bring the Sample of Indurium Ore to Pozzik on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ,"Rizzle's schematics describe the process of the refinement of indurium ore. From his scrawls, it is apparent that indurium ore is being obtained from the dwarven excavation site of Uldaman in the Badlands. Much of the other notes relate to the heat resistant properties. Used as a paperweight for the plans is a hunk of what appears to be unrefined indurium ore. "
4567,Pacify the Centaur,"Kill 12 Galak Scouts, 10 Galak Wranglers, and 6 Galak Windchasers, and then return to Cliffwatcher Longhorn in Freewind Post. ","<name>, I entreat you to hunt these centaur down. They shall feel the wrath of our revenge. Attack the centaur camp to the north of Freewind Post!  Let wrath guide your hand! "
4568,Wharfmaster Dizzywig,Bring Kravel's Parts Order to Wharfmaster Dizzywig at Ratchet in the Barrens. ,"I make it my job to get people what they need, and the gnomes over there need a parts order filled.  Their parts were shipped to Ratchet a week ago, but I haven't been able to make the trip. So, are you ready for some legwork?  Go to Ratchet and give this parts order to Wharfmaster Dizzywig -- he'll probably be at the docks. Do this for me, and I'll have more jobs for you. Jobs, my friend, with serious profit potential. . . "
4569,Parts of the Swarm,Return to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar. ,"Head back to Belgrom in Orgrimmar and tell him Moktar be doing his bidding well out in the Thousand Needles. Tell him also, that me studies progress, and I hope to be havin' learned more soon. That should please him greatly. "
4570,Delivery to the Gnomes,Bring the Delicate Car Parts to Fizzle Brassbolts in Shimmering Flats. ,"Now that I have what I need, give these parts to Fizzle Brassbolts.  He's been waiting a long time for them -- I'm sure he won't miss the little piece I removed from his order. . . And I wouldn't bother mentioning it to him.  It was small and worthless. Trust me. "
4571,Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout,Bring the Fool's Stout back to Kravel on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ,"I figured out how to use Zanzil's mixture with stout to make a powerful libation.  A Fool's Stout.  I think it'll be just what Kravel needs, but try it out and let me know how it works. And <name>, don't keep this stuff too long without using it.  Zanzil's mixture has a weird effect on the stout's yeast, kicking it into high gear.  So it won't stay fresh forever. "
4572,Encrusted Tail Fins,Bring 10 Encrusted Tail Fins to Wizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats. ,"Our rocket car is the fastest thing on the flats!  So fast that. . . I'm afraid friction is going to tear it apart! To prevent that I need to create a composite to coat the car's moving parts.  It must be hard but not brittle, and must be resistant to salt corrosion, or time spent on the Shimmering Flats will eat it away. Have you heard of the Vile Reef, <name>?  It's off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale.  Saltscale murlocs live there, and their tail fins are a crucial ingredient of my composite. "
4573,Parts for Kravel,Bring Kravel's Parts to Kravel Koalbeard on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ,"Here's Kravel's package, <name>.  And when you deliver it, tell him. . . if he wants more special orders, then he'll have to pay his tab! "
4574,A Different Approach,Gather 2 handfuls of Purifying Earth from Thundering Boulderkin and take them to Wizlo Bearingshiner at Whitereach Post. ,"What's a sin'dorei doing standing on the top of a windswept butte in Thousand Needles instead of the halls of Silvermoon? It's simple. My brethren will no longer have me. Every copy of my treatise on natural cures for our magical addiction was burned. I can safely pursue my research here, but I am without my reagents. If you'd be willing to gather purifying earth from the thundering boulderkin near the western end of the Needles and deliver it to my associate at Whitereach Post, I'd appreciate it. "
4575,News for Fizzle,Speak with Fizzle Brassbolts on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ,"Indurium has an amazing resistance to heat!  I'm sure it will work for Fizzle's pistons.  But he'll need true indurium ore, not just the flakes. To get the ore, it must be mined from deep within Uldaman, on the northern borders of the Badlands.  That is the true source of indurium. Send Fizzle Brassbolts my regards, and tell him what I told you. Safe travels, <name>.  And it won't surprise me if we meet again -- once Fizzle learns of indurium he'll probably send you to Uldaman to acquire it! "
4576,Get the Goblins Drunk,Bring the Fool's Stout to the Goblin Pit Boss at Mirage Raceway in Thousand Needles. ,"We need to try the Fool's Stout on one of the pit crews.  If you want to try it on the goblins, then here -- take the stout and give it to the goblin pit boss. And don't wait too long.  This stout will go bad eventually. "
4577,Goblin Sponsorship,Speak to Gazlowe at Ratchet in The Barrens. ,"Our racing team is the pride of goblins everywhere. You'd be surprised at some of the people who contribute in one way or another to our team. You know Gazlowe? He tracks down parts from around the world for us. He even came down to work on one of our rigs once! A few weeks ago, he said he'd send us a new prototype fuel regulator but it hasn't come yet. He's usually very prompt. . . Maybe you wouldn't mind going to Ratchet to ask him about it? I wouldn't be so pushy, but the gnomes are gaining on us! "
4578,Family Tree,Deliver Cliffwatcher Longhorn Report to Nataka Longhorn at Ghost Walker Post in Desolace. ,"My brother Nataka is stationed at Ghost Walker Post over in Desolace. I'd like to ask you. . . could you give this report to him for me? A year has passed since the last time I wrote, there has been unusual centaur activity since then and he should be informed. Journey to Stonetalon Mountain north of the Crossroads, and then head west into Charred Vale. From there, head south into Desolace; there you will find a road going south to Ghost Walker Post. "
4579,Indurium,Bring 10 Indurium Flakes to Martek the Exiled in the Badlands. ,"I'm not out here just to stay away from people.  There is a wealth of metal in the Badlands, <name>, if you have the guts to get it. The metal's called indurium and as luck would have it, it is rumored to possess high resistance to heat and stress.  It might work for Fizzle's car. But let's make sure.  Get me samples of indurium and I'll test its properties. True indurium ore lies deep in Uldaman, but the Stonevault troggs of the Badlands sometimes have flakes of it on them.  Bring me those flakes. "
4580,Goblin Sponsorship,Speak with Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay. ,"I'm afraid I can't be of much more help to you, <name>. If you'd like to follow up on it more, I'd suggest you go hit up the Baron himself. If there's anyone who knows Revilgaz's business, it's Revilgaz. You'll find him at the tavern across the harbor, top floor. "
4581,Goblin Sponsorship,Deliver the Fuel Regulator Blueprints to Pozzik on the Shimmering Flats. ,"You should be all set to go. Give Pozzik my regards and tell him that if he ever needs anything, not to hesitate to ask. I'll be waiting for the news that he breaks the track record soon! "
4582,Serpent Wild,Report your findings to Motega Firemane at Whitereach Post in Thousand Needles. ,"If I did not see that with my own eyes I would never have believed it to be true. Vengeance has come to Thousand Needles! <Hagar wipes his brow. ><name>, you must act quickly! Go now and seek out Motega Firemane; he is located at Whitereach Post just northwest of Freewind Post along the road. He will know what to do! "
4583,Message to Freewind Post,Bring the Urgent Message to Cliffwatcher Longhorn at Freewind Post. ,"Brave traveler, the centaurs have increased their attacks in this area. Freewind Post must know about this renewed harassment immediately! Seek Cliffwatcher Longhorn at Freewind Post to the southeast and give him this urgent message. Be warned, avoid the Grimtotem Clan nearby. . . they have been acting strange toward us lately. "
4585,The Brassbolts Brothers,Bring the crate of crash helmets to Wizzle Brassbolts at Mirage Raceway in Thousand Needles. ,"You ever heard of the Shimmering Flats?  It's a stretch of salt flats way over in Kalimdor, just south of the Thousand Needles canyon.  It's a great place for racing because, well, it's so flat! A couple of gnome brothers are out there, friends of mine, trying out their new rocket car, and from what I hear it's fast!  Heh, so fast that their pilots keep crashing.  Giving themselves concussions. So they asked me for some Siege Engine helmets, but I have duties here.  I can't make the trip! Can you? "
4586,<NYI> <TXT> Get those Hyenas! ! ! ,Bring 7 Spotted Hyena Pelts to TESTTAUREN at Freewind Post. ,"I want some Hyena Pelts, and only the best will do!  Get me spotted Hyena pelts and I'll give you phat lewtz, yo. "
4587,Hemet Nesingwary Jr. ,Take Kravel's Crate to Hemet Nesingwary Jr. ,"I have a package for a new customer of mine, a dwarf named Hemet Nesingwary Jr. .  The package took weeks to arrive, and Hemet's long gone by now.  He said he was going to Stranglethorn to take his father's place and hunt the beasts there, but he left me some money to send his delivery when I could. Junior's a rich dwarf and it's a good idea to keep up relations with the rich ones, yeah?  So. . . you want to deliver the package for me? I heard he has a camp in Stranglethorn, north of Grom'gol. "
4588,Hardened Shells,Bring 9 Hardened Tortoise Shells to Wizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats. ,"My brother is working on a new fuel for his rocket car.  He's brilliant, he really is.  So brilliant that. . . I think that new fuel he's designing is strong enough to eat right through the car's chassis! I want to reinforce its fuel tanks before that happens. The tortoises out on the flats have very hard shells.  I want to use them to create new tanks for our rocket car.  Tanks that can hold my brother's new fuel. You look responsible enough.  Will you get me those shells? "
4590,Salt Flat Venom,Bring 6 Salty Scorpid Venoms to Fizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats. ,"I have so many designs for our rocket car!  So many!  And I must try them all! ! I'm working on a new type of fuel.  One that burns really really really hot! !  I haven't gotten the mixture perfect, but I think I know what I need. . . The scorpids who wander the Shimmering Flats have a venom with lots and lots of salt in it.  It's very unique!  And it's just what I need! Bring me venom and trust me -- our car will fly! ! "
4591,The Eighteenth Pilot,Speak with Razzeric on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. ,"I'm going to be busy with working on integrating this new fuel regulator to our racer designs, but if you'd like to help out the team some more, talk to Razzeric. He's our pilot--well, our eighteenth pilot, to be exact--and he likes to add his own little modifications to the racers. He's a little off his rocker, though, so try not to act too surprised. "
4593,Rocket Car Parts,Bring 30 Rocket Car Parts to Kravel Koalbeard in the Shimmering Flats. ,"Heh heh, with all the races they're running here, it's no surprise that a few mishaps happen along the way.

I know I promised Pozzik that I'd deliver a new fuel regulator for him, but I still haven't received it yet.

We can at least find out if it was dispatched from Booty Bay. Check in with Wharfmaster Lozgil over there, he should be able to check the cargo records. "

4602,Steelsnap,Bring Steelsnap's Rib to Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff. ,"At times we hunt for food.  At times we hunt for honor.  And at times we hunt to earn the Earthmother's teachings. But the hunt I now set upon you is none of these things.  It is to slay a creature outside the Earthmother's blessing. The hyena Steelsnap roams the Thousand Needles, south of the Barrens.  He is a tyrant, attracting other hyenas to him and spreading fear and bloodshed among more peaceful beasts. Find Steelsnap, <name>.  Find him, and defeat him. "

That should fix the Horde's problem in Stonetalon, yes? But to create the toxin, I will need the blood of innocents, a difficult ingredient to obtain.

The Venture Company must have a means of sending messages and light cargo between its headquarters and its operations in Stonetalon.  It is likely a small sky port -- not big enough for a zeppelin, but perhaps for a flying machine.  You must search the areas in Stonetalon under control of the Venture Company and find this sky port, if it exists.  If you find it, then place the toxin there. Place it, and run. "

The Cenarion Circle wants to study this soil in large quantities; go into the wilds of Un'Goro and acquire enough of it for our continued research. The rich soil will stick out in piles from time to time, and some of the beasts might have usable samples on their being.

""Taking a moment to replace the panel, you wonder if it'll be that simple to fix A-Me 01 and get her back to Karna Remtravel near Marshall's Refuge. Only trying it will tell. "
4658,"Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw? ",Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 12 Silithid Eggs. ,"The venomhide hatchling 's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention. It begins scratching pictures of silithids into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them. It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles. They can only mean silithid eggs. The Noxious Lair, in western Tanaris and near the border with Un'Goro Crater, would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants. "
4659,Gorishi Grub,Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 10 Silithid Meat. ,"The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The hatchling's drawings seem to resemble various types of large insects, perhaps the gorishi silithids. The hatchling finishes his picture, then gestures at it with one short arm, snaps its jaws, and licks its lips. It must want you to go to the Slithering Scar, in center of the southern part of Un'Goro Crater, and gather silithid meat. When you have the meat, feed it to your hungry hatchling. "
4660,Alien Ecology,Use the Scraping Vial to collect a Hive Wall Sample from one of the Gorishi hive hatcheries in Un'Goro Crater. ,"Just because we've suffered a setback doesn't mean that research must stop!  We were investigating the Gorishi insects in the southern part of the crater before winding up here.  Their presence is alien to the ecology of Un'Goro, and we want to find out why. In their hive network must be larval hatcheries.  You can identify these places by their hanging larval spawns.  Use this vial to take a sample of the hive wall near any of the hatcheries.  Bring it back to me for study, but be careful! "
4661,It's Dangerous to Go Alone,"It's Dangerous to Go Alone is the finale to the Linken questline, a long Legend of Zelda themed questline that begins by players finding A Wrecked Raft in Un'Goro Crater. ","<name>, I finally remember now. . . I did come here to fight Blazerunner. I was on a journey, and this was to be the last step. But I am no longer the hero. . . You are. All that you have done -- you must finish this now, not me. Blazerunner guards an artifact called the Golden Flame. It provides power more vast than anything else I have ever known, and it is dangerous in the hands of one with an evil heart. You will want to bring others with you -- it's dangerous to go alone. Take this as my advice. "
4662,The Videre Elixir,Seek out Gregan Brewspewer in northern Feralas. ,"Now, what's this? Linken. . . FORGOT? Oh, I see. . . Lost his memory. . . Well, here is his sword. It's not complete, though. I know of the one that can finish it, but. . . speaking with him may prove difficult. Listen, I know of someone that will be able to help you. It's too much to explain right now, but you must somehow acquire a Videre Elixir. The only one I know that can help you with that is Gregan Brewspewer. He's hard to track down, but last I knew he was camping in the wilds of Feralas. "
4663,Meet at the Grave,"Go to the graveyard outside Gadgetzan, and use the Videre Elixir. ","This elixir will allow you to speak with one that you would not normally even see. . . Take the Videre elixir, along with Linken's sword, to the graveyard just outside Gadgetzan in Tanaris. Once there, drink the potion. You may be quite surprised at the results, but do not be alarmed. In your ""other"" form, head due north until you reach the mountains. You'll find the one you need to speak with in one of the rocky crevices. His name is Gaeriyan. Remember, he will only speak to you in that form. . . "
4664,Lost! ,Find Ringo at Fire Plume Ridge. ,"You've got to help me, <name>! My friend, Ringo left earlier to explore the volcano to the south of here, and he has been gone way too long. I am really worried about him. Do you think you could find him? Why don't you take my canteen with you -- if you do find Ringo, I'm sure he'll need it! "
4665,Aquementas,"Take the Book of Aquor, the Silvery Claws, and the Irontree Heart to Tanaris. ","Take this bag of supplies with you to Tanaris. Travel to Lost Rigger Cove, and look for a circle of stones. The eastmost peninsula is the secret. . . From this circle only, read from the book of Aquor; summon the only creature that can transform the items you collected into a totem to fight Blazerunner. Aquementas will not be pleased to be awakened, but remember, you must remain in the circle for him to transform the items. "
4666,Crystals of Power,"Collect 7 Power Crystals of each color: red, blue, yellow, and green. ","I'm sure you've noticed 'em, <name>. They're everywhere! What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course! The crystals. . . They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them. I've been doing experiments here with them for a while, but I can't seem to find anything. Well, I haven't yet, anyway. Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me? "
4667,A Little Help From My Friends,Lead Ringo to Spraggle Frock at Marshal's Refuge. ,"Ugh. . . It's so hot. . . I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion. Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Refuge. I think I'm well enough to follow you there. I am feeling a little out of it, so if I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope. . . "
4668,The Activation Rune,Obtain the Omega Rune inside the Shaper's Terrace and bring it to The Etymidian. ,This colossal being appears to be inactive.  You notice an empty rune-shaped slot on its chest. Perhaps you might be able to find the missing rune inside the nearby overlook. 
4669,It's a Secret to Everybody,Look around in the pond for a clue about who this wrecked raft may belong to. ,"A destroyed raft rests along the shoreline. Considering this is only a small pond, it is not clear as to how it ended up here, although looking at the trees tells you that the water level may not be constant. Perhaps a little exploration in the area might uncover more clues. . . "
4670,Searing Roc Feathers,Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to get 5 pieces of Searing Roc Plumage. ,"The hatchling looks at you for a moment, almost as if wondering whether you'll understand. It scrawls a picture of a pair of feathers in the dirt, then points with one claw to the bindings at its elbows and knees. It doesn't seem hungry, but what could the feathers be for? It must want them for adornments like the ones you've seen on other raptors. The largest feathers come from the searing rocs that congregate around the bones of large creatures in western Tanaris, northeast of Thistleshrub Valley. "
4671,Crystal Yield,The Pylon table allows you to combine red power crystals with blue power crystals. ,"Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors. As you push the last one into place, a burst of light fuses the crystals together. The resulting combination is now yours. "
4672,"Hungry, Hungry Hatchling",Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 15 pieces of Fresh Dinosaur Meat. ,"The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The drawings are rough, but you can make out the shapes of diemetradons, stegodons, and pterrordaxes. As the raptor finishes the sketch, it looks up at you, bares its teeth, and makes a biting motion. Your venomhide hatchling must be craving fresh meat from these animals. Find and kill any type of diematradon, stegodon, or pterrordax in Un'Goro Crater and feed its meat to your hungry hatchling. "
4673,The Scent of Lar'korwi,Bring 2 Ravasaur Pheromone Glands to Torwa Pathfinder near the entrance to Un'Goro Crater. ,"I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, <name>. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us. Being the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands. "
4674,Venomhide Eggs,Bring 4 Venomhide Ravasaur Eggs to Mor'vek in the southeast part of the Marshlands. ,"Now that you've built up an immunity to venomhide toxin, you can safely handle the animals and their eggs. Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch. If you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests. Look for the eggs with lighter colored shells -- those are the ones that will hatch venomhides. If you bring me several of the eggs, I'll allow you to keep one and raise its hatchling, with my guidance. "
4675,Linken's Memory,Find Eridan Bluewind in southern Felwood. ,"Oh. . . Linken? Yeah, he's a funny one. When he first got here, he was mumbling about all kinds of strange things. Probably got bumped on the head pretty hard, I imagine. Something he said kinda stuck with me though -- that he was making some sort of totem; said he had to talk to someone named Eridan Bluewind. . . in a place called Felwood, I think? I doubt he could tell you much now, though. If you want to know more, maybe you should look for Eridan yourself? "
4676,Haze of Evil,"Collect 5 samples of Atal'ai Haze, then return to Muigin in Un'Goro Crater. ","To tell you the truth, <name>, I've never seen any plants like this in my travels. Perhaps I should take a trip to this crater. . . At any rate, I think I know just the thing Muigin 's looking for -- Atal'ai haze. It's horrid stuff, hard to collect, but it's just what he needs to control the little monsters. You'll need to visit the temple of Atal'Hakkar in the Swamp of Sorrows. The Atal'ai haze can be collected from the deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes found there. Good luck, <name>! "
4677,The Bait for Lar'korwi,"Using the contents of Torwa's Pouch, summon Lar'korwi and defeat him. ","This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan. To the north of here, you will find a small trail into the mountains. It was here I saw Lar'korwi last. You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby. Take the meat you recovered and place it there. Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat. If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will. "
4678,It's a Secret to Everybody,Examine the items inside the pack and bring them to their owner. ,"Grabbing onto it, you pull the pack back to the shore. Perhaps if you examine the items inside the pack, you might find out more about who it belongs to. There are a few stray travelers at Marshal's Refuge. Perhaps you might find out more there. "
4679,Crystal Restore,The Pylon table allows you to combine green power crystals with yellow power crystals. ,"Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors. As you push the last one into place, a burst of light fuses the crystals together. The resulting combination is now yours. "
4680,A Gnome's Assistance,Find J. ,"Thinking. . . Thinking. . . I know I came here for something important. . . I have an idea, <name>. In the cave over there is a gnome named J. D. that was very kind to me when I first arrived here. Perhaps in my disoriented state, I might have mentioned something to her. Why don't you go ask her if she knows anything? Oh, but be careful -- she's always messing with those crazy glowing crystals I've seen in the crater. I'm not quite sure what she's up to in there! "
4681,"Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw? ",This is an obsolete version of this quest. ,"The venomhide hatchling 's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention. It begins scratching pictures of silithids into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them. It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles. They can only mean silithid eggs. The Noxious Lair, in western Tanaris and near the border with Un'Goro Crater, would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants. "
4682,Gearing Up To Ride,"Bring 20 Rugged Leather, 20 Runecloth, and 80 gold to Mor'vek in the southeast part of the Marshlands in Un'Goro Crater. ","Your venomhide is strong and healthy and you've developed quite a bond. You'll be ready to ride him once I've completed your saddle and bridle. Just like you, they have to be specially conditioned to stand up to the toxins the raptor produces. All you'll need to do is bring me some rugged leather, runecloth, and money to buy the rest of the supplies and I'll have that saddle for you in no time. "
4683,Chasing A-Me 01,Find A-Me 01 in Un'Goro Crater. ,"Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions. You've seen mechanical squirrels, yes? Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01. She has scrying gems for eyes so I could see everything she saw. She made it to Fungal Rock--the apes' lair--just east of here, and that's when I lost contact. The last thing I saw was one of their alpha males rushing up to say hello to her! Can you help me find her? "
4684,It's a Secret to Everybody,Take Linken's Sword to Donova Snowden in Winterspring. ,"You see, I have no idea how I ended up here. No one really knows -- it's a secret to everybody! I just can't seem to remember anything. . . These items you brought to me, though. . . I am remembering something. My sword. I am supposed to strengthen it somehow, but I'm really not sure why. Sorry I can't tell you more, but I just don't remember! Anyhoo, I do know where you can take it -- Donova Snowden in Winterspring. You'll find her by the hot springs. She can temper the sword by the pools there. "
4685,Expedition Salvation,Bring a Crate of Foodstuffs and Research Equipment to Williden Marshal in Un'Goro Crater. ,"I don't know how you made it here, but you're a sight for sore eyes!  I'm Williden Marshal, and I lead a non-aligned expedition troupe.  Our latest and greatest endeavor has met with what seems like countless disasters, the most serious of which being that we underestimated the savagery of Un'Goro Crater! As we fled our base camps in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the crater, we left behind vital supplies.  You look like you're capable enough - can you help us by getting them back? "
4686,Dadanga is Hungry! ,Dadanga looks up at you as you approach her. ,"Placing the sprouts in front of her, Dadanga seems pleased. She nudges a small brown-wrapped package towards you, in exchange for the treat! "
4687,Linken's Adventure,Take the Silver Totem of Aquementas to Linken in Marshal's Refuge. ,"To think all this time that the reason Linken came here was to rid us of Blazerunner. . . He seems like such an ordinary guy, but I did notice that he's not at all interested in any of my experiments or gadgets like most gnomes would be. He must be a true warrior at heart. Bring the totem to him. See if that helps him remember why he came here. "
4688,Beware of Pterrordax,"Kill 10 Frenzied Pterrordax, then speak to Spraggle Frock at Marshal's Refuge. ","Wanted: A skilled fighter to deal with the threat of the Pterrordax that inhabit the Un'Goro Crater. Their numbers are growing, and they are becoming a menace to travelers in the area. Decrease the population by slaying 10 frenzied pterrordax. Speak with Spraggle Frock after completing the task for a reward. "
4689,Chasing A-Me 01,Escort A-Me 01 back to Karna Remtravel in Un'Goro Crater. ,"Checking to see if you're prepared to lead A-Me 01 back to Karna Remtravel, you flip the switch to the ""Off"" position. Glancing around once again to make sure none of the gorillas are coming, you prepare to see what happens when you flip the switch back to the ""On"" position. This is your last chance. . . are you sure this is what you want to do? "
4690,Volcanic Activity,"Collect 9 samples of Un'Goro Ash from the fire elementals around the volcano in Un'Goro Crater, and return them to Liv Rizzlefix in Ratchet. ","Being an apprentice to Marvon Rivetseeker, I've learned so much. But he's been gone for such a long time now, so I think I'm going to work on some experiments of my own. I've been reading about Un'Goro Crater most recently, and about the strange volcanic activity going on in the middle of the crater. I think a lot could be learned if I could just get some of the ash from the elementals there. Do you think you'd mind collecting some for me, if you are going that way? "
4691,"Hungry, Hungry Hatchling",Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 15 pieces of Fresh Dinosaur Meat. ,"The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt.

4694,The New Springs,Travel to Winterspring and speak with Donova Snowden. ,"Now, I've heard about other hot springs in a place called Winterspring, far to the north of here. The strange thing is, there are no volcanoes anywhere near them. Interesting, I know. Well, if you want to find out more, you should head to Winterspring and speak to a friend of mine.

It's HIS fault we're lost! I'm the one that knew the way, but he insisted he knew a shortcut, and we ended up here! To make matters worse, now he keeps sending his crazy plant pests to annoy me. I'm so angry that I'm not planning on talking to him any time soon, but these pests are too much to handle. Why don't we try to limit his supply, first thing. Go out and hunt some Bloodpetals, then return to me. "
4697,A Visit to Gregan,Take a Bloodpetal to Gregan Brewspewer in Feralas. ,"I'm not quite sure what to make of this, <name>. The plants. . . they seem to have some minimal intelligence. I'm no expert, though. But, I do know someone that is! Head to northern Feralas, and look for a buddy of mine named Gregan Brewspewer. He's an expert on this sort of thing. I'm sure Gregan can help us out here. You'll find him out in the wilderness; he's not the type to live in a big city. "
4698,A Grave Situation,"Resurrect, then look for the gravestone that Gaeriyan told you to find. ","If you return to the graveyard, <name>, you will find a gravestone there. . .

If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it. Return to me afterwards. "
4707,Roll the Bones,Bring 8 Dinosaur Bones to Spark Nilminer in Un'Goro Crater. ,"You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging.  There might be worse things to do in this world. . . but none really leap to mind. We were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons.  Well, there are plenty of live ones there too!  Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones.

4708,The Eastern Pylon,Discover the location of the Eastern Crystal Pylon in Un'Goro Crater. ,"During my stay here, I have heard strange rumors about mysterious pylons existing out in the wilderness of the crater, <name>. I guess that they are quite large, with crystals lining their interiors.

I got stranded here, and I'm absolutely horrible at finding my way around. I'd take a gryphon or wind rider back to Gadgetzan, but those beasts just scare me to death. So, will you help me? All I have left to build is the wings, and I was thinking that the webby scales from the pterrordax and diemetradon would be perfect.

Find and hunt him, before he discovers your intent. All that have gone up against Ursius have quickly found themselves to be the prey, and he, the hunter. Stay on your guard. "
4720,Winterfall Runners,Find the Winterfall Runners and stop them from delivering their shipment to Winterfall Village. ,"Very interesting, <name>. . . When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater. We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment. "
4721,Brumeran of the Chillwind,Storm Shadowhoof at Everlook in Winterspring wants you to kill Brumeran. ,"Swift, and clever, Brumeran glides silently across the snowy landscape of southern Winterspring. But do not let her graceful appearance convince you that she is harmless. All that cross her pay considerably, and often with their own lives. Seek out Brumeran of the chillwind among the chimera. Defeat her, then return again to me. "
4722,Shy-Rotam,Storm Shadowhoof at Everlook in Winterspring wants you to defeat Shy-Rotam. ,"In northern Winterspring, great cats assemble around a large landmark called Frostsaber Rock. The leader of these cats is known by the name Shy-Rotam. Defeating the matriarch of the frostsabers would grant you much respect in the eyes of your fellow <race>. Go again to the harsh wilds, and once there, gather sacred meat from the frostsabers. Find the stone of Shy-Rotam, and place it there. Placing the meat of her kin before her will summon Shy-Rotam, in anger. Be ready for her fury, and defeat her. "
4723,Words of the High Chief,Take the Crudely-written Log to Kelek Skykeeper in southern Felwood. ,"The Winterfall are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the furbolg to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper. He is part of a group known as the Emerald Circle, druids that are committed to their work in Felwood, healing the land from the corruption. Kelek has much experience with the furbolgs in Felwood, and may be able to tell you more about the log. Thank you, again, <name>. "
4724,Lorax's Tale,Speak with Lorax. ,The Satyr paces about and talks to himself. Do you wish to question him? 
4725,Winterfall Firewater,Bring the Empty Firewater Flask to Donova Snowden in Winterspring. ,"This vial that you picked up from the Winterfall furbolg is empty, but you can detect a few drops of a strange green liquid inside; it almost glows. Is it something important? Donova Snowden would probably be able to tell you more, since she has been camped by the hot springs in Winterspring for some time now. "
4726,"Are We There, Yeti? ","Take Umi's Mechanical Yeti and scare her friends with it: Legacki in Everlook (Winterspring)Sprinkle in Gadgetzan (Tanaris)Quixxil in Marshal's Refuge (Un'Goro Crater)When you are done, bring the Mechanical Yeti back to Umi. ","It's all ready, <name>! Now, I sent some mail to my friends already, telling them that I have a surprise for them. This is where you come in! I'm going to give you my mechanical yeti, and you need to surprise them by paying each of my friends a visit, turning the yeti on and sending it towards them.

","It is said that only one Breastplate of Bloodthirst has ever been created and that it was made for the legendary assassin, Garona. Whether this world will ever see another is doubtful. Regardless! Our master crafters can reproduce the item given the necessary components: *The pristine hide of the Beast. * Frayed abomination stitchings. * Arcanite bars. *The skin of shadow. BEHOLD! "
4728,High Chief Winterfall,Donova Snowden in Winterspring wants you to defeat High Chief Winterfall. ,"While we still know very little about why the furbolg have been ingesting this strange substance, I do think it's best that we put a stop to it before it gets out of hand. The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but I think that if their leader is slain, they will not get any worse. Head east to Winterfall Village. "
4729,Winterfall Ritual Totem,Take the Winterfall Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item. ,"You have found one of the Winterfall furbolg's ritual totems.  The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but it seems to emanate an almost tangible sense of dread and despair.  If many of the Winterfall furbolgs do indeed carry these, it certainly would go a long way in explaining their current condition. One of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item. . . that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you. "
4730,Troubled Spirits of Kel'Theril,Use Jaron's Pick to find the four Highborne Relic Fragments. ,"The highborne spirits are miserable creatures, that's for sure. They are still searching for pieces of the very thing that has cursed them to Kel'Theril forever -- the stolen relic. If you are that interested, take my pick and go south to the lake, see if you can gather the pieces of it from within the ice. Now, I can't tell you a thing about what you find, but I do know of someone who might. . . Aurora Skycaller; she dwells near the Northpass Tower in the northern part of Eastern Plaguelands. "
4731,"Are We There, Yeti? ",Collect 10 Thick Yeti Furs for Umi Rumplesnicker in Everlook. ,"My friends are always coming up with great ideas. I've never felt like I could match them. . . until today! I just drew up the plans for something great! If you promise not to tell, I'll let you in on the secret. . . I'm going to make a mechanical yeti! Not only are my friends sure to be freaked out when they see it, but when they get over that, I know they'll be impressed! I need thick yeti fur from the ice thistle yeti to start with. Will you help? You'll find them to the southeast. "

Gather meat from the chimaera and from the shardtooth bears in the area. Bring it to me so that I may use it to feed the frostsabers that are being trained. "
4734,Strange Sources,"Follow Donova Snowden's instructions, then report back. ","To tell you the truth, although there are no volcanoes here in Winterspring, I believe that there are far more threatening reasons for these hot springs. . . Well, I think you'll want to see it for yourself. You'll need to travel the length of Winterspring, and head to the very south. When the air becomes thick and muggy, and the sky turns dark, you'll have found what I believe to be the source of the hot springs. Have a look. I'm sure you'll have many questions when you return. "
4735,Luck Be With You,Collect 4 Frostmaul Shards for Witch Doctor Mau'ari in Everlook. ,"Ah, I can tell just by lookin' at ya -- you be wantin' to make a lucky charm. Mau'ari always knows! To da south. you'll find a canyon, an' giants made a' solid ice. The giants sometimes be carryin' dem, but ya can always gather da shards yerself from da canyon. These shards have a powerful reflective quality. Bring back 4 frostmaul shards, and my lucky charm will be yours. "
4736,Guarding Secrets,Take the Blue-feathered Necklace to Nara Wildmane. ,"While I do possess much knowledge about the owlbeasts you defeated in Winterspring, I am not very learned on the subject of the magics they wield. But I do believe I know of one that would be able to examine the necklace and most likely tell you what it is. Nara Wildmane in Thunder Bluff is an expert in this field; see her. Good luck, <name>. "
4737,Cache of Mau'ari,Speak to Witch Doctor Mau'ari again in a moment to receive the lucky charm. ,"Now, before I give ya dis charm, I better explain how ta use it. If you carry da charm with ya, you'll find dat certain items will drop from creatures ya fight. If you don't have da charm with you, you won't find them. Understand?

4739,Wildkin of Elune,Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus. ,"That's fascinating! I have always wondered about the truth. . . Well, you must share this knowledge, definitely! Go to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm right away -- you'll find him in Darnassus, in the Cenarion Circle. Explain to him what happened, just the same as you told me. I'm sure he will be just as interested! This is important information, <name>! "
4740,Chillwind Horns,Collect 8 Uncracked Chillwind Horns. ,"I have most of what Tinkee needs, but I'm missing one important component, and that's chillwind horns.  The horns of the chillwind chimaera in Winterspring are a concentrated source of cold, but only pristine, uncracked horns will do!  I'll need a supply of those to complete Tinkee's order. Bring me the uncracked chillwind horns, and I'll prepare a package for Tinkee. "
4741,Leggings of Arcana,"In order to create the Leggings of Arcana, you will be required to bring the following items back to Malyfous Darkhammer: 1 Pristine Hide of the Beast; 5 Frayed Abomination Stitchings; 5 Arcanite Bars; 5 Frostwhisper's Embalming Fluid. ","While the crafting of such an item has never successfully been accomplished, it is thought to be possible - under the right circumstance. Should the seeker of arcanum desire to imbue leggings with immense power, the following they must find: * The pristine hide of the Beast. * Frayed abomination stitchings. * Arcanite Bars. * Frostwhisper's embalming fluid. BEHOLD! "
4742,Threat of the Winterfall,"Donova Snowden in Winterspring wants you to kill 8 Winterfall Pathfinders, 8 Winterfall Den Watchers, and 8 Winterfall Totemics. ","I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have. . . strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg. They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here. I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me? "
4743,Mystery Goo,Report back to Donova Snowden with your findings. ,"The greenish substance inside the cauldron appears to be similar to what you found in the flask. This strange gooey stuff could be as corrupted as the furbolg that created it. . . If the Winterfall furbolg are using it, does this mean that they will soon be as corrupted as the Deadwood tribe? It would be best to report back to Donova with your findings, along with a sample of the liquid in the cauldron. "
4744,Enraged Wildkin,Speak with Jaron Stoneshaper at Starfall Village. ,"Have you noticed the abandoned camp to the south of here? It looks like the wildkin went crazy and destroyed just about everything they could find! I heard a rumor that one of the survivors of the attack is resting at Starfall Village, west of here. I'm sure curious about what happened. . . aren't you? "
4745,Guardians of the Altar,Protect Ranshalla while she attempts to reactivate the Altar of Elune. ,"At the very top of the ridge lies what I believe to be an altar of the goddess Elune. From what I can tell, we need to light the five torches in each cave, and then we will be able to access the altar directly. I transcribed some incantations carved into the stone in the ancient ruins of Kel'Theril, which I believe are the secret to unlocking the altar. I'll need your help to light each torch, while I recite the spell. If we are successful, you'll be able to report our findings to Erelas! "
4746,Guarding Secrets,Take the Blue-feathered Necklace to Trull Failbane at Bloodvenom Post. ,"You are unsure of the significance of the necklace that fell from the neck of the recently-slain wildkin. It glows brightly, slowly fading in and out. Trull Failbane might be able to tell you more, since his knowledge of the wildkin seems extensive. Perhaps you should ask him about it. "
4747,Toxic Horrors,Collect 3 Toxic Horror Droplets for Donova Snowden in Winterspring. ,"I've studied the sample you returned with, and while I can't say for sure, I believe it contains traces of toxic elements. However, the only way to know for sure is to gather some as a comparison. I believe that the Deadwood furbolg may be gathering these elements from other corrupted creatures in Felwood; in particular, the elementals living in the Irontree Woods, called toxic horrors. Collect a few samples for me to compare, but be careful -- it's very dangerous there! "
4748,Enraged Wildkin,"Pick up Jaron's Supplies from the snow, then find the wildkin that stole the amulet Jaron spoke of. ","After inspecting the contents of the box, you decide that Jaron could make use of the tools and other items inside. However, there is no sign of the amulet. It appears that the wildkin inhabit the lands to the north and east of here, so you decide that the next step is to face the creatures and reclaim the amulet from them. "
4749,A Strange One,Speak with Winna Hazzard in Felwood. ,"I just got back from Felwood, <name>. On my way through, I stopped at Bloodvenom Post and I met a very odd character. . . She seemed intent on one thing, and I suppose I could tell you what that is, but I think she'd like to explain it to you herself. If you're interested, head to Bloodvenom Post in western Felwood and look for Winna Hazzard. Who knows, she might need your help. . . "
4750,A Yeti of Your Own,"Say! You know what? ! You're an engineer too! So, since you helped me teach my friends a lesson, I'm going to teach you how to make your very own mechanical yeti!

So, since you helped me teach my friends a lesson, I'm going to teach you how to make your very own mechanical yeti! Now the fun can go on forever and ever, and you can scare whoever you want! Provided that you can scare up the components to make it that is. What do you say, <name>? Do you want to learn the secret to making a mechanical yeti? "
4751,Falling to Corruption,Search the Deadwood furbolg camp in northern Felwood for a clue. ,"This greenish liquid. . . it reminds me a bit of the sludge I saw when traveling through Felwood. And I have seen some Winterfall Runners passing into Timbermaw. . . Perhaps these things have something to do with the flask you found, <name>. There is a large group of furbolg just past Timbermaw Hold, in Felwood. Called the Deadwood tribe, they have been corrupted and driven mad by the fel. Why don't you look around there and see if you can find any evidence of dealings between the Winterfall and the Deadwood? "
4752,Rampaging Giants,Rivern Frostwind wants you to kill 4 Frostmaul Giants and 4 Frostmaul Preservers. ,"Around 4, 000 years ago, Tyrande Whisperwind saved the life of the frostsaber queen, at the hands of rampaging giants. Since then, the frostsabers have been allies of the night elves. These same giants that once were a danger to the frostsabers, still exist not too far from here. They are called the frostmaul, and they have taken over the large valley to the south. Prove your loyalty to the frostsabers; kill these giants in the name of the frostsaber queen, Shy-Rotam! "
4753,"Are We There, Yeti? ",Collect 2 Pristine Yeti Horns for Umi Rumplesnicker in Everlook. ,"Now that I have what I need to cover the mechanical moving parts, I only need one other thing. Well, actually two. Two horns! The ice thistle patriarchs and matriarchs have the largest horns, so of course, those are the ones I want. That type of yeti inhabits a cave to the southeast. There are plenty of them there; you shouldn't have any problem finding them. Remember, I only want the best looking ones -- no beat up or broken horns, please! "
4754,A Little Luck,Speak with Witch Doctor Mau'ari in Everlook. ,"We can always use a little luck, eh? A small advantage is all it takes to turn things in your favor. . . I happened to make the acquaintance of a rather eccentric witch doctor some time back. She made me a lucky charm. . . for a price. Believe me, though, it was well worth it! Maybe you'd be interested in one of your own? Find Witch Doctor Mau'ari in Everlook. I'm not giving mine up! "
4755,Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff,"Deliver the book, ""Studies in Spirit Speaking"", to Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff at Light's Hope Chapel, Eastern Plaguelands. ","A recluse medium found in these parts by the name of Umbranse has provided the Argent Dawn with quite a literary masterpiece. . . one that amounts to quite possibly the largest collection of jibber-jabber I've ever seen written. One of the Dawn's most respected leaders, Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff, is a brilliant linguist.  Could you take this to him for me - for a reward, of course?  Light's Hope Chapel - that's where he's currently at, far in the eastern part of the Eastern Plaguelands. "
4756,Fiery Plate Gauntlets,"Bring Malyfous Darkhammer 6 Enchanted Thorium Bars, 2 Essence of Fire, and 4 Star Rubies. ","By Thaurissan's beard! Where did you find them? More importantly, are you willing to part with them? Naturally, I would pay you for such a noble gesture. I'll tell you what, <name>. If you give me those unfired gauntlets, I will teach you how to make a set all your own. All you need to do is collect the parts for me so that I may narrow down the exact recipe. Do we have a deal? ? Here's the list of what I need, I'll front the non-enchanted thorium myself since you're supplying the gauntlets. "
4757,Enraged Wildkin,Find Jaron Stoneshaper's wrecked wagon. ,"Looking around, you don't see much that Jaron could want here. However, you do notice that the crate you found has been smashed open, almost as if this was what the wildkin were after. . . Looking to the east, you can barely make out an abandoned wagon. Perhaps you might find Jaron's things there. It's worth a look. "
4758,The Ruins of Kel'Theril,Speak with Jaron Stoneshaper in Starfall Village. ,"The story behind Kel'Theril is one of a cursed race, bound to the place where they attempted an unfortunate ritual. . . The highborne that you will find there once stole a sacred artifact, believing that they could siphon its power for themselves, becoming even more powerful. In their efforts, the relic shattered in a huge explosion, driving the pieces below the ice of the lake. . . Speak with Jaron Stoneshaper if you'd like to learn more; he has recently visited the area and can tell you more. "
4759,Enraged Wildkin,Locate Jaron Stoneshaper's wrecked camp and supplies in southern Winterspring. ,"Hey there, <lad/lass>! I was chased from my camp in southern Winterspring by some bloodthirsty wildkin! Well, I suppose I got too close to something the wildkin were guarding.

I really need my supplies, and I'd also like to get back the amulet I unearthed yesterday at the dig site. "
4760,Winterfall Intrusion,Rivern Frostwind wants you to slay 5 Winterfall Shaman and 5 Winterfall Ursa. ,"My presence goes unnoticed by most, <name>. However, there is an annoyance that seems firmly rooted here in Winterspring: the Winterfall furbolg. Although I have never directly attacked the furbolg, they seem crazed, fearful of anything in their path. I have watched them slay countless creatures that had the misfortune to simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I am weary of their meddling -- please, help me by fighting back. Slay the furbolg and keep them away from Frostsaber Rock. "
4761,Wrath of the Blue Flight,Speak with Haleh if you wish to continue. ,"We understand what the cursed brood of Deathwing attempts to do and we know that it cannot be allowed. Because of the protection Blackrock mountain affords Nefarian, it has become increasingly difficult for us to intercede. We can, however, empower you, mortal - should you so choose. The path before you is one full of peril. You must decide whether to accept our help. Ponder this and speak with me again when a decision has been made. "
4762,Trouble in Winterspring! ,Find Donova Snowden near the hot springs in Winterspring. ,"There's trouble in Winterspring! Why, sure, I spend some time out in the wilds and know about these things. . . I'm always mighty proud to say it. I consider the hours I spend out there in the hills to be golden.

The crystal of Zin-Malor can never be returned to the temple which, as you know, lies in ruin. But I believe that your effort to undo the evil of the past should not go unrewarded. Seek out Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus, and bring the crystal to him, <name>. It should be in the hands of those that will not abuse its power.

The Scarlet courier is scheduled to pass by the Scarlet Overlook within the hour. The roads by the overlook are wide open and swarming with Crusaders.

I can see as clearly now as the day that I plunged the Ashbringer into my own heart to free my father's cursed soul: my last memory as a free man.

","We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house. We weren't expecting what we found in there, <name>. Seems the Crusade's been real busy. That whole thing is full of Argent Dawn prisoners. Most of them were already dead by the time we arrived, but a few were still breathing.

4851,In Service Of The Lich King,Report to Instructor Razuvious in the Heart of Acherus. ,"All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the Scourge. Gaze now upon the lands below us.

You will don the Scarlet courier's clothes and with the help of some dark magic, take on the form of the courier. Abbendis is at King's Harbor, southeast of the Scarlet Overlook. Drop off the message and get as much information out of her as you can. She will tell us what we need to know about the ""Crimson Dawn. """

This will be your first lesson in Scourge warfare: TERROR! Go to the front lines, south of here, and destroy Scarlet Crusaders. Leave their corpses so that we may utilize them for the death march. But most importantly: kill the fleeing villagers. Soldiers dying are an affordance, but villagers? That is what strikes fear into the hearts of man. "
4855,Gothik the Harvester,Speak with Gothik the Harvester at Death's Breach. ,"CHAOS, <name>! The Crusade is in a frenzy. They have diverted all forces outside of New Avalon to set up a blockade at Light's Point, east of here. They are desperately trying to strip the Havenshire Mine of all resources and load the cargo aboard the frigates they have docked on the coast. Let's stir things up a bit, shall we? Gothik the Harvester, grand necromancer of the Lich King, has graced us with his presence. He has a gift he'd like to bestow upon the Scarlet Crusade. Seek him out. "

It's your life or theirs! . ,"The endless hunger will soon take hold of you, <class>. When it does, you will feel pain immeasurable. There is only one remedy for the suffering: the hunger must be sated. I give you the key to your salvation. Chained to the Heart of Acherus are those deemed unworthy of the dark brotherhood.

Live or die - the choice is yours to make. "
4857,Lambs To The Slaughter,Baron Rivendare at the Crypt of Remembrance has commanded you to slay 10 Scarlet Crusade Soldiers and 15 Citizens of New Avalon. ,"Most humans would have fled the moment a Scourge necropolis took up residence in their air space. Not the Scarlet Crusade! I must confess - I rather enjoy our exchanges with the Crusade. Through the years, Scourge battles against them have resulted in several of the most tragic events in human history. Yet here we stand - AGAIN - locked in battle! We shan't deny them the pleasures of eternal servitude to the Lich King! Enter New Avalon and fulfill their death wish. Leave no survivors. "
4858,The Plaguebringer's Request,"Noth the Plaguebringer has requested that you bring him 1 Empty Cauldron, 1 Iron Chain and 10 Crusader Skulls. ","Look at this pumpkin patch! Notice anything missing? Of course you don't, because you're a moron! Your brain was probably the first thing to die. <Noth sighs. >I have been commanded to put together a plague cauldron. You will help me. Directly inside the gate of New Avalon is the inn. Enter the inn and steal an empty cauldron. Then go to the forge, also near the gate, and steal some iron chains.

4860,Tonight We Dine In Havenshire,Orithos the Sky Darkener at Death's Breach wants you to recover 15 Saronite Arrows. ,"The Sky Darkeners are mindless constructs with one purpose: KILL! Specifically, they are aiming to kill any man or woman that they see fleeing Havenshire for the safety of New Avalon. We certainly can't allow those cowards to make it to safety and then take up arms against us! There is one slight problem. They use saronite arrows for maximum range and damage. Saronite, however, is a metal only found in Northrend, so supplies are limited! Retrieve those arrows for me and I will reward you handsomely. "
4861,The Scarlet Harvest,Report to Prince Valanar at Death's Breach. ,"Below Acherus stands Death's Breach, the staging point for our assault upon the Scarlet Crusade.

4864,Nowhere To Run And Nowhere To Hide,Prince Keleseth at the Crypt of Remembrance has ordered you to kill Mayor Quimby and recover the New Avalon Registry. ,"Nothing less than total annihilation will suffice, <name>. To that end, a few hundred mindless ghouls assaulting the front gate of New Avalon will not do. We must infiltrate the inner sanctum and dispose of their officials. They must be shown that no one can escape the Scourge's grasp! Make your way to the New Avalon Town Hall, southwest of here, and assassinate the mayor.

4870,Noth's Special Brew,Place the Pile of Crusader Skulls inside the Plague Cauldron. ,"The cauldron is ready to begin spewing its foul corruption across the land! Now, death knight, a brief lesson in plague cauldrons. The gas that the cauldron emits is deadly to the living, but empowers Scourge. As with all Scourge creations, it feeds off of death and grows stronger the longer it feeds. Take these Crusader skulls and drop them in the cauldron. You will be quite happy with the results. "

You must take the essence-infused moonstone to a place of great power in order to lure the god from the relative safety of the Emerald Dream. Descend into the Sethekk Halls and set the moonstone in the clutches of the raven's claw. You'll find it in the chamber before the talon king's hall. Anzu must be made believe that his followers have gathered to welcome him back into the world. Once he has manifested, show him no mercy! "
4886,The Eagle's Essence,Defeat the Guardian of the Eagle and obtain the Essence of the Eagle. ,"The Book of the Raven tells us the raven's followers captured and bound the spirits of his rivals within stone shrines. A guardian was set to watch over each, lest the raven's enemies attempt to free them. The first of the shrines is the eagle's, found in the hills to the south of Lake Jorune and west of Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. The tablet says that the eagle fought valiantly, but was overcome by a swarm of enemies. The armor and endurance of your bear form is well-suited to this fight. "
4887,The Principal Source,Use the Empty Cliffspring Falls Sampler to draw a sample of water from the mouth of the cave by the falls. ,"The Cliffspring Falls in Darkshore serves as the principal source of drinking water for the region, and now I suspect it is the principal source of the poison that is harming the local fauna - deer specifically.  Use this sampler to draw some water from the mouth of the cave; be careful, as dangerous naga now reside in a cave by the falls. Once filled, deliver it to Alanndarian Nightsong in Auberdine.  She is the one that requested our aid, and you will work with her to address this malady. "
4888,Morthis Whisperwing,Seek out Morthis Whisperwing at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"Before all of the druidic orders coalesced into the Cenarion Circle, the Druids of the Talon were responsible for teaching promising young druids the mysteries of flight. With the dissolution of the order, former members teach the skill sparingly. Even now, Morthis Whisperwing continues his search for a suitable apprentice. Few druids have truly mastered all the forms available to them, but you show the promise Morthis requires of his students. Seek him out at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. "
4889,Chasing the Moonstone,Bring a Southfury Moonstone to Morthis Whisperwing at the Cenarion Refuge. ,"If the essences are combined within a rare gemstone such as a Southfury moonstone, you'll be able to release them when you're prepared to challenge Anzu. The only problem is that Southfury moonstones are only found on the Azshara side of the river, on the cliffs near the river's source. Tragedy befell the last night elf party that sought the stone. Their boat is still anchored in the river near where they sighted the moonstone. Keep your eyes open and approach the site by land from the Azshara side. "
4890,A Better Ingredient,Retrieve a Putrid Vine from the guardian at the bottom of the Sunken Temple and return to Torwa Pathfinder. ,"It is as I feared -- the toxin is simply too weak for such a powerful creature. If we are to create a toxin of high enough potency, you must venture to the bottom of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar, unlock the secrets of the altar and recover a putrid vine from the guardian there.  The temple is dangerous, and it would behoove you to bring friends. Return to me when this is done. "
4891,The Principal Source,Use the Empty Dreadmist Peak Sampler to draw a sample of water from a pool at the top of the peak. ,"Dreadmist Peak to the northwest of the Crossroads is most likely a primary candidate as to the source of the spread of the poison.  Its airy peaks have pools of water that influence the weather patterns.  I suspect the water is now tainted by the demon-worshipping Burning Blade. Use this sampler to draw water from the pool at the very top of the peak.  Once filled, deliver it to Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads.  He is the one that requested our aid, and you will work with him to address this malady. "
4892,Body and Heart,Use the Cenarion Moondust on the Moonkin Stone of Auberdine to bring forth Lunaclaw. ,"Directly east of Auberdine lay many moonkin caves.  The one closest to Auberdine has a Moonkin Stone inside it.  Lunaclaw, the defender of the stone, will face you only when Cenarion Moondust is applied to it.  Lunaclaw possesses within it a strength that you must use as one of the Claw. You've earned the right to use this Cenarion Moondust, <name>. . . now show me that you've earned the right to possess the strength of body and the strength of heart needed as a druid! "
4893,Body and Heart,Use the Cenarion Lunardust on the Moonkin Stone between Mulgore and the Barrens to bring forth Lunaclaw. ,"On land west of Taurajo in the Barrens - just before it turns into Mulgore - lies a Moonkin Stone.  The moonkin are special beasts, not native to these parts.  Lunaclaw, the stone's defender, will face you when Cenarion Lunardust is applied to it.  Lunaclaw possesses within it a strength that you must use as one of the Claw. You've earned the right to use this Cenarion Lunardust, <name>. . . now show me that you've earned the right to possess the strength of body and the strength of heart needed as a druid! "
4894,Eternal Vigilance,Speak with Morthis Whisperwing to receive an Essence-Infused Moonstone. ,"Your defeat of Anzu, the raven god, is truly a remarkable accomplishment. He may not abandon his quest to return to Outland, I fear. As long as he has followers here, he will attempt to rise again. Keep the essence-infused moonstone with you in case we have not heard the last of Anzu. "
4895,Gathering the Cure,Bring 5 Earthroot and 12 Lunar Funguses to Alanndarian Nightsong in Auberdine so she may make a curative salve. ,"The water will serve as the base of the curative salve I'll make for the deer.  For curative properties, I need some earthroot.  Herbalists know how to find it, so if we're unlucky and you aren't one then you'll need to find one to help us out. Finally for potency, I need some lunar fungus.  Finding lunar fungal blooms is easy enough; they're all over the place in caves just to the east of here.  Moonkin reside in the caves and they're irritable as of late, so be careful. "
4896,Trial of the Lake,"Find a Shrine Bauble in Lake Elune'ara, and take it to the Shrine of Remulos in northwestern Moonglade. ","For your first trial, search the depths of Lake Elune'ara to locate a Shrine Bauble.  It decays rapidly, so proceed with it to the Shrine of Remulos post haste.  Use the bauble at the shrine, and then speak with Tajarri there; she is one of Moonglade's most trusted wardens. You only have a set amount of time to complete the task, and you may be competing against other druids searching for baubles themselves.  Mental and physical dexterity will be critical to your success. Good luck, <name>. "
4897,Aquatic Form,Return to Darnassus and show Mathrengyl Bearwalker the Pendant of the Sea Lion. ,"You have completed the necessary lessons all young druids are taught before they can adopt an aquatic aspect.

4899,The Raven Stones,Gather 8 Raven Stones from Skettis and bring them to Arthorn Windsong at Evergrove in Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"I've trained your sparrowhawk to respond to a specific whistle. When it hears the sound, the bird will fly to you and guide you to the location of the nearest tablet fragment. Arthorn sent word that the fragments you're looking for are buried in the Skettis area of southeastern Terokkar Forest, so the bird will wait for you there. When you've gathered all the stones, return the whistle to Arthorn and she will see to the animal's care and release. Convey my greetings to Arthorn when you see her. "

Remember what others must endure in fighting poisonous afflictions as you soon embrace your newfound power over poison. You should now return to Mathrengyl Bearwalker in Darnassus, <name>.  He, no doubt, has a very important spell to teach you now that the student understands the lesson given unto <him/her>. Farewell, young druid.  We shall speak again. "
4901,A Lesson to Learn,"Speak with Dendrite Starblaze in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade. ","<name>, I have been following your progress with much delight.  You are most assuredly developing yourself into a valued protector of nature. The time has come for you to learn more about one of the various animal aspects that Cenarius has blessed us with the ability to change into - one that affords you command and mastery of the water.  For this, you must travel to the village of Nighthaven in Moonglade and speak with Dendrite Starblaze of the Cenarion Circle there.  He will guide you further. "
4902,The Ward of Wakening,"Bring 10 Bogblossoms, 10 Ancient Lichen, and 10 Dreaming Glory to Morthis Whisperwing at the Cenarion Refuge. ","Long ago, the relics used to teach the ways of the stormcrow were entrusted to an ancient druid. Your training requires these relics, so we must wake their guardian from his slumber. I will prepare a potion you can use to ease the process. The mixture requires common herbs, as well as bogblossom, which usually grows atop the tallest mushrooms in the marsh. Fly up there and pursue them but take care, as they're quite fragile and may explode violently if mishandled. "
4903,The Book of the Raven,Use an Aether Ray Eye with your Seer's Stone to reveal the raven cult ghosts. ,"From what you've told me, Morthis's suspicions seem plausible, but we need confirmation. In his research, Timeon has uncovered clues that a ""book of the raven"" served as an ancient scripture to the cult. The arakkoa spirits will not reveal themselves to your eyes. Take this stone with you to the high peaks in the western part of Blade's Edge, to the south of Raven's Wood, obtain an aether ray eye, and combine them to augment your sight. Search for the ghost Timeon identified as Sai'kkal the Elder. "
4904,Waking the Sleeper,Use the Ward of Waking to help Clintar Dreamwalker emerge from the Emerald Dream. ,"Take the ward with you and travel to Moonglade, to the Stormrage Barrow Dens. Within the southernmost of the Stormrage Barrow Dens, watched over by the dreamwardens, you will find Clintar Dreamwalker. Administer the potion and watch over him while he wakes. He'll be extremely vulnerable as his spirit reunites with his body and he certainly won't recognize you. Declare yourself to him as soon as he comes around, <name>. He will need your help to gather the relics for the ceremony. "
4905,Curing the Sick,Use the Curative Animal Salve on 10 Sickly Deer that are located throughout Darkshore; doing so should cure them. ,"The amount of salve made out of the reagents you brought me is good enough for ten doses, <name>.  While I work with the village to try and make some more salve, I'd like for you to help us get a head start.  All around Darkshore are sickly deer; use the salve on them and cure their malaise. Dendrite Starblaze in Moonglade will want to talk to you when you're done, I'm sure.  Please extend Auberdine's thanks to the Cenarion Circle there. . . and let me say thanks to you directly for the help you've given! "

As that road enters the crater, you will find Torwa close by. "

4909,No Mere Dream,"Protect Clintar Dreamwalker's Spirit while it gathers the relics of Aviana, then speak to Dreamwarden Lurosa. ","<Clintar listens as you relay Morthis' instructions, nodding, but clearly fearful. >I cannot extricate myself fully from the Emerald Dream to help you, but a fragment of my spirit will guide you in your search for the relics. Guard it well, <race>, for it is a fragile thing. The Emerald Dream itself has become an alien, dangerous place. Its grasp on me is strong, and I will not be whole until the Emerald Dream returns to normalcy. What you see around you is but an echo of the reality inside the dream! "
4910,Trial of the Lake,"Find a Shrine Bauble in Lake Elune'ara, and take it to the Shrine of Remulos in northwestern Moonglade.

4911,Gathering the Cure,Bring 5 Earthroot and 5 Kodo Horns to Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads so he may make a curative salve. ,"The water will serve as the base of the curative salve I shall make for the gazelles.  For curative properties, I need some earthroot.  Herbalists know how to find it, so if you are not familiar with this skill you'll need to find one to help us out. Finally for potency, I need kodo horns - mere chips and fragments will not suffice.  Kodos you can handle wander the northern part of the Barrens; bring some down for the greater good of the balance <name>, and fetch the horns for me. "
4912,Heeding the Call,"Speak with Mathrengyl Bearwalker in the Cenarion Enclave, Darnassus. ","Excuse me, friend. . . It has come to my attention that Mathrengyl Bearwalker has put out word that he wishes to speak with you.

He is located in the Cenarion Enclave of Darnassus, on the second floor of Fandral Staghelm's tree. "

Cenarius has blessed us with the ability to purge even the most foul of poisons with but a mere incantation.

4914,Back to Darnassus,Return to Darnassus and speak with Mathrengyl Bearwalker in the Cenarion Enclave. ,"The time has come for us to part ways, young one, as the application of your lessons takes you back to whom that sent you to me.

Listen to his instructions, and you will soon complete your first lessons into your role as a protector of balance. Go now, young one.  We shall meet again. "
4915,Toxic Test,Stab a Devilsaur with the Devilsaur Barb. ,"The toxin you helped me create is for a special purpose.  The great devilsaurs of the crater make it dangerous to hunt and difficult for me to survive.  Even if I possessed the necessary strength, killing a devilsaur simply allows another to move into its territory. Take this poisoned barb and stab it deep into a living devilsaur.  The toxin should pacify the creature, though I do not know how quickly. . . "
4916,Return to Cenarion Refuge,Bring Arthorn's Package to Morthis Whisperwing at Cenarion Refuge. ,"Bring the essences to Morthis Whisperwing, along with word of our findings about the raven god. Morthis will know best how to use the essences and information in drawing Anzu out into the open. Make your way to him quickly, for there's no telling how long Clintar and the dreamwardens can withstand the raven's assault! <Arthorn grabs your arm before you turn to leave>. Please, <name>, tell Morthis how much of a help I've been to you. I fear he will not see my hand in this work! "
4917,The Hawk's Essence,Defeat the Guardian of the Hawk and bring the Essence of the Hawk to Arthorn Windsong at the Evergrove. ,"<Arthorn's voice addresses you. >The last, and strongest, of the spirits spoken of in the Book of the Raven is that of the hawk. It was imprisoned far from Skettis, in a shrine on a remote island southeast of Auchindoun. I believe this description best matches the island we know as Sorrow Wing Point. The tablet describes the hawk's guardian as nearly invulnerable to the bird's claws. Forsake physical attacks and call down the fury of the stars to defeat this foe. Do not repeat the hawk's mistake. "
4918,Eyes in the Sky,Speak with Watcher Elaira at the Twilight Ridge in Nagrand. ,"Locating the pieces of the Book of the Raven, if they survive at all, is going to be difficult. Our best hope is to use a keener pair of eyes than your own. Down in western Nagrand, on the eastern lip of the Twilight Ridge, Watcher Elaira studies the various bird species that make their home there. Visit her and see if she can help you harness avian sight to gather the pieces of the Book of the Raven. "
4919,Return to Morthis Whisperwing,Bring the Relics of Aviana to Morthis Whisperwing at Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"Now that the relics have been recovered, you must leave this place with all haste. Clintar risked his safety and that of the dreamwardens to help you, <name>, but now he must fully devote his attention to fighting the force that has invaded the Emerald Dream.

4921,To Catch A Sparrowhawk,Use the Sparrowhawk Net to capture a Wild Sparrowhawk and bring it to Watcher Elaira on the Twilight Ridge. ,"The wild sparrowhawks of Nagrand have the keenest sight of all the predatory birds here. But, because of their size, they've been pushed out of most areas by the larger windrocs. Most of the sparrowhawks nest here, on the Twilight Ridge. If you can catch one, I'll train it to spot the pieces of your buried tablet. It's going to be difficult, though. The sparrowhawks are very skittish and will flee at your approach. I'd suggest cornering one or prowling to get close enough to cast your net. "
4922,Back to Thunder Bluff,Return to Thunder Bluff and speak with Turak Runetotem on the Elder Rise. ,"The time has come for us to part ways, young one, as the application of your lessons takes you back to whom that sent you to me.

Listen to his instructions, and you will soon complete your first lessons into your role as a protector of balance. Go now, young one.  We shall meet again. "
4923,Bloodpetal Poison,"Collect 8 Bloodcap and 8 Gorishi Stings, and return to Torwa Pathfinder in Un'Goro Crater. ","I would ask you to help me create a toxin of sorts, to pacify a great creature living here in the crater.

4924,To the Evergrove,Speak with Arthorn Windsong at the Evergrove in Blade's Edge Mountains. ,"Are you certain you saw a raven in the barrow den? This is a troubling development. There's little we can do to help Clintar and the dreamwardens directly, but if we can learn more about what's threatening the Emerald Dream, we may be able to stop it. We've been learning about the resurgence in an ancient arakkoa cult in Blade's Edge -- one that venerates a raven god. Go to the Evergrove and find Arthorn Windsong. There may be a connection between what's happening there and in the Emerald Dream! "
4925,Great Bear Spirit,Seek out the Great Bear Spirit in northwestern Moonglade and learn what it has to share with you about the nature of the bear. ,"In the northwest part of Moonglade resides the home of a wise and noble being we call the Great Bear Spirit.

4928,Moonglade,"Use the spell ""Teleport: Moonglade"" to travel to Moonglade. ","All druids are welcomed to the sacred lands of Moonglade, tauren and night elf alike.  Keeper Remulos - Moonglade's guardian - keeps watch over all druids who hibernate there.  Now that you're learning the ways of the Claw, I'll teach you the spell that lets you transport yourself there.  Cast it whenever you seek Moonglade's knowledge or solace.

Unfortunately, the best power sources are usually the oldest and the hardest to get.  It's neat how fate likes to take a bite out of you sometimes, isn't it?

5014,Mana Surges,Kill 12 Mana Surges in the allowed time limit. ,"We are almost finished, but this last step is the most perilous, <name>. I have the empty summoner's orb and am ready to empower it.  We will do this by harnessing the energy of a mana rift.  I'll cast a spell that will temporarily open a rift, from which creatures, mana surges, will pour out.

5017,Mirror Lake,Bring a Mirror Lake sample to Jennea Cannon in Stormwind. ,"This world has been victim to massive mystic struggles, which tore magic currents from once stable channels.  We struggle to determine the effects these changes have caused, and some of us fear the worst! But I will reveal more of this later.  Right now, we need you to gather information.

The Celestial Orb is ready.  Or if you'd like I can mount it atop a staff.  It's up to you.  I'd prefer the orb, but who am I to judge? "
5025,Journey to the Marsh,Speak with Tabetha. ,"Now it is time for you to earn your mage's wand.  To begin this quest, speak with the human hermit Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.

5026,Glyphic Memorandum,Read the Glyphic Memorandum and speak to Marryk Nurribit inside Anvilmar above Coldridge Valley. ,"While you were helping me out, this memorandum was given to me to pass on to you. Take some time to read it when you have a chance. I'm thinkin' it came from the mage trainer Marryk. Take a gander at it and go find him inside Anvilmar when you've a chance. "
5027,Mage Training,Speak with Julia Sunstriker - the Mage class trainer - inside the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you.  For young mages here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Julia Sunstriker.  Speak with Julia and see what training she has available for you.  The things she will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you. Julia - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level. "

5029,Glyphic Scroll,Read the Glyphic Scroll and speak to Isabella in the church in Deathknell. ,"Ah, while you were off dealing with the mindless Scourge, this scroll arrived for you. I would think it's some matter of importance as it seems it bears the seal of the mage trainer Isabella. I would take some time to read it before heading out again. "
5030,The Exorcism,"Kill the Demon of the Orb, then speak with Tabetha. ","Now that we have a summoner's orb, we must exorcise the demon within it.  I can do that.  That's the easy part. You're the one who has the hard job.  You're the one who has to kill the demon once it's out. And you'll have to be quick.  If you take too long then he'll jump back in the orb and we'll have to start over! So get yourself ready.  Prepare your strongest spells and keep your potions handy, and go get a friend if you have one.  Because this isn't going to be pretty. "
5031,Glyphic Tablet,Read the Glyphic Tablet and speak with Mai'ah near the entrance to the Den in the Valley of Trials. ,"Ah, while you were gone a tablet came for you, <name>.

I cannot leave the tower, and would ask you to kill the vile creature in possession of this artifact.

5033,The Purest Water,Instructor Antheol wants you to fill the Azure Phial at Elrendar Falls. ,"Now that you've learned a little lesson, I'll offer you something more substantial.  It concerns your ability to defend yourself in close combat.  Of course, you should only resort to melee in the most dire of circumstances, but that is no excuse to be unprepared. I can assist you in creating a staff befitting a mage of your learning.  Simply take the phial you retrieved for me and fill it at the base of Elrendar Falls.  Just follow the river southeast from here. "
5034,Speak with Bink,Speak with Bink in Ironforge. ,"<name>! Bink, my gnome colleague in Ironforge, sends word.  She has a task that needs doing and won't rely on anyone but a mage to do it!  Are you that mage, <name>? If so, then speak with Bink.  She spends her time in the Hall of Mysteries in the Mystic Ward of Ironforge. "
5035,The Balnir Farmstead,Bring Balnir Snapdragons to Anastasia Hartwell in the Mage Quarter of the Undercity. ,"The Plaguelands to the east are an aberration.  Devised by the Lich King, they spread their magic into the soil, corrupting and killing all that live.  Although there is a certain charm to the destructive forces of the plague, we, the mages of the Forsaken, believe it is unruly and must be curtailed. But first, we must measure how far it has spread into Tirisfal.  Go to the Balnir Farmstead in eastern Tirisfal.  In the garden are flowers--snapdragons.  Gather these and return. "
5036,High Sorcerer Andromath,Speak with High Sorcerer Andromath. ,"High Sorcerer Andromath wishes to speak with you, <name>.  He is at the top of the wizard's sanctum, in the mage's district of Stormwind. It would be wise to speak with him, for Andromath is one of the most powerful mages not locked away in Dalaran.  Council with him is high council indeed. "

Enjoy, and if you find it amenable, please mention so to Deino.  She is a <class> on whose good side I wish to stay. . . "
5038,Fragmented Magic,Polymorph the Spitelash of Azshara and kill the clones that appear several seconds later. ,"My research has revealed a unique purpose for the prismatic shell. Carry the shell and cast your polymorph spell on the Spitelash in Azshara.  If you wait a few moments, the chaotic aura of the shell will cause them to split into several smaller clones for a few moments.  Kill these clones as quickly as possible, and the shell will collect their essence. When the shell is full, return it to me. "
5039,Speak with Anastasia,Speak with Anastasia Hartwell. ,"<name>, Anastasia Hartwell has a task for someone of your talents.  Speak with her in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity, and prepare yourself for your first task for the mages of the Forsaken. "

5042,A Simple Robe,Arcanist Vandril wants you to bring him 15 Linen Cloth and a Spindleweb Silk Gland. ,"The arcane fragments you collected will do nicely. Nicely for what, you ask?  For making a splendid robe fit for a <class> like yourself! All we need now is some linen cloth and a spindleweb silk gland.  You can find the silk gland from any spindleweb spider, preferably after killing them. "
5043,Return to the Marsh,Speak with Tabetha. ,"It is time, <name>, for you to speak with Tabetha. . . the hermit of Dustwallow Marsh.  She will instruct you on the creation of a powerful mage's implement. Tabetha 's shack lies deep in Dustwallow Marsh, west of Theramore. "
5044,Glyphic Letter,Read the Glyphic Letter and speak to Khelden Bremen inside Northshire Abbey. ,"I was asked to bring this to your attention as soon as you returned from the kobold camps, <name>. It appears to be a letter sealed with the insignia of Khelden, our local mage trainer. I wouldn't hesitate to read it before you go about any other business here in the Abbey. "
5045,Manaweave Robe,Here is your robe. ,"Here is your robe.  It's one of my best made yet!  Wear it with pride, and when people ask. . . tell them you got it at the Larson Clothiers! "
5046,The Siren's Coral,Collect 6 Enchanted Coral and return them to Archmage Xylem. ,"Take a look around you.  The ruins and beaches are overrun with spitelash.  Recently, the wretched creatures have learned to recognize the rare components indigenous to Azshara. Specifically, I speak of enchanted coral -- they are drawn to it by reasons unknown to me.  Now there is little coral left in the bay, and it is vital to my research.  I need you to separate some enchanted coral from the spitelash sirens and bring it to me. "
5047,Control,"Kill Murlocs of the Silting Shore to summon a Quel'dorei Magewraith, then destroy it. ","You have chosen the path of the <class>, and so you must learn control. Magic, when unchecked, can corrupt souls and destroy worlds. To fully understand, you must face one who has been consumed by magic. Travel to the beaches on the northwest coast of Azuremyst Isle and use your spells to decimate the murlocs. The display of power will attract the attention of the evil force lurking there, a Quel'dorei magewraith. Defeat it. When you have finished, seek out Bati at the Vault of Lights in the Exodar. "
5048,Arcane Reavers,Arcanist Vandril wants you to collect 10 Arcane Fragments for him. ,"Arcane reavers are magical creations of brute strength.  They are heavily armored and deliver stunning blows.  You, however, can bypass their defenses and avoid their attacks.  Your spellcraft is not without many advantages, <name>. Travel to Dawnstar Spire and blast apart the arcane reavers.  From their remains, collect the crystallized fragments of magical energy and return to me.  Dawnstar Spire is found to the east, across the lake. "
5049,Mage Training,I am pleased that you have come seeking my knowledge. ,"I am pleased that you have come seeking my knowledge. We have much to do if your magical skills are to be honed.

5050,Report to Jennea,Speak with Jennea Cannon in Stormwind. ,"Your knowledge of the craft grows, young <name>.  Are you now ready to begin your true lessons?

She has a task for you which will open your first window into the invisible world. "
5051,The Test of Righteousness,Wait for Jordan Stilwell to finish forging a weapon for you. ,"Why don't we go over to the forge and get started on this? I've been preparing for your arrival for some time, so it shouldn't take long at all. When we're done, you'll be far more prepared to defend the Light than you have been, this much I swear. I'll be somewhat honest, <name>, seeing the results of your exploits makes me somewhat envious. But knowing that I can contribute to your adventures in my own significant way does bring me some joy. "
5052,True Masters of the Light,Use the Extinguishing Mixture near the eternal flame in the Alonsus Chapel to remove the Light's protection. ,"Ours is the true way of utilizing the Light, <name>. To show others that would call themselves 'paladins' the folly of their ways, I intend to send an unmistakable message. The Alonsus Chapel, where the Order of the Silver Hand was founded, seems immune to the destruction of Stratholme. The chapel's eternal flame affords it the Light's protection, but when you use this mixture to extinguish the flame, that protection will be no more. It will burn, and our dominion over the Light will be proven to the world. "
5053,The Blood-Tempered Ranseur,Wait while Bemarrin forges your weapon. ,"I've got everything prepared, <name>. Very soon you will have a weapon befitting your new status. "
5054,The Tome of Valor,Defend Daphne Stilwell from the Defias attack. ,"Now, they'll be coming again soon, I'd wager, so get yourself ready. I've got myself a gun in the house. I'll grab it and be ready to help you out, but for the most part, you're on your own. I've no idea how many they'll send, but I'm sure it'll be more than the few they sent earlier. Ask the Light for whatever blessings you can because. . . did you hear that? I think they're coming. We make our stand near the house! "
5055,Redemption,Jol wants you to resurrect a Young Furbolg Shaman with the Symbol of Life and return to her. ,"Your task then, <name>, is to aid our new allies, the Stillpine furbolgs. Several of the younger Stillpine shaman stumbled across a Bristlelimb camp and were slaughtered to the last.  Take this Symbol of Life and resurrect one of the shaman. Bristlelimb Enclave is located to the east of the road just after you cross the bridge spanning Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isle.  Speak with me when you have done this. "
5056,Emphasis on Sacrifice,Travel to Ironforge and get High Priest Rohan's Exorcism Censer. ,"In order to prepare yourself for this task, you must first show due sacrifice and judgment. . . with an emphasis on sacrifice. You must acquire High Priest Rohan 's exorcism censer for your task.  Even though its use will be for good and just reasons, due compensation must be given for it. Proceed to Ironforge and speak with the High Priest.  By bringing ample coin with you to help offset the loss of his censer, it will show your due sacrifice. Go now <name>, time is of the essence. "
5057,Bailor's Ore Shipment,This quest may no longer be available. ,"Ach, ya startled me, <man/woman>! Can't ya see I was lost in thought? What's that? Jordan's shipment. . . fer Ironforge. Ahhh, yeah, I know whatcha speak of. Mo'grosh ogres. . . dat's who took me ol' friend's ore shipment. Caravan was headin' here from the Wetlands and was ambushed. The guard who survived their attack just passed away a few days ago--healer couldn't get to 'em fast enough. If you want the shipment, you'll have to head northeast across the Loch. It's got to be there somewhere. "
5058,Redeeming the Dead,Take the Filled Shimmering Vessel to Silvermoon City's inn and use its magic to resurrect Sangrias Stillblade. ,"While you were preparing the vessel, I sent a group of initiates to retrieve Sangrias Stillblade. You will find him on the top level of Silvermoon's inn with an attendant. Make your way there with all haste and unleash the vessel's magic to restore him to life. Time is of the essence, <name>. Once he has been dead for too long, not even the Light can bring him back to us. Return to me once you have resurrected Stillblade. "
5059,Ancient Evil,Unlock the secrets of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar to release Atal'alarion and recover the Putrid Vine from his flesh. ,"If you wish to turn these stones into a weapon to fight the Scourge, you must acquire something equally vile to fortify them. An ancient evil lies hidden at the bottom of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar in the Swamp of Sorrows.  Release the creature there and destroy him, taking only a small part of his body back to Mehlar Dawnblade.  My guards will deliver the scourgestone fragments to Mehlar. "
5060,The Test of Righteousness,Speak to Jordan Stilwell in Ironforge. ,"Actually, I have no doubt that Jordan himself would like to thank you, and seeing as I need a messenger to send word that his wife is safe, I think you'd be a perfect choice. Jordan was to be a paladin of the Light before his dedication to his father's craft took him on another path--he's intimately familiar with our way of life and is considered among our most faithful. He should still be in Ironforge--he likes to work outside the gates during the day, something about the cool mountain air. "
5061,Collection of Goods,"Bring 40 Runecloth, 6 Arcanite Bars, 10 Arthas' Tears, 5 Stratholme Holy Water vials, and 150 gold to Grimand Elmore in the Dwarven District of Stormwind. ","You'll need four things for the barding - runecloth for the lining, arcanite bars for the plating, Arthas' Tears for the spiritual attunement, and Stratholme holy water for the spiritual imbuement.  Actually, you need five things. . . gold for my fee.  That fee includes all labor as well as a handcrafted saddle and stirrups. Once you've got all that, I'll be able to finish your barding.  Until then, there are some things I can get started on for you while you assemble your collection of goods. "
5062,Seeking the Kor Gem,Bring a Kor Gem to Thundris Windweaver in Darkshore. ,"Greetings, <name>. What can I do for one who follows a holy path? Ah, yes, Stilwell, the blacksmith. . . from long ago. I remember him well, though, I have not heard his name in some time. He never struck me as an impudent man, so I can only assume his desire for a Kor gem is noble. If you truly wish for one of the gems, then you must head to the northwest of Ashenvale. You will find Blackfathom Deeps there within some ancient ruins. The naga who still use the gems are down below. Do not go alone, <class>. "
5063,Forging the Mightstone,"Collect Amber, Blue, and Green Voodoo Feathers from the trolls of Sunken Temple. ","Now we must combine the inert scourgestones and create a weapon to shatter the ranks of undead.  This is no trivial task, <name>.  Only the trolls of the sunken temple carry the kind of rare magic able to turn the evil of something against itself. In the temple, the trolls are known as Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro.  Do not feel remorse for their corrupt souls. . . they are not without evil. "
5064,The Second Trial,"Complete the Second Trial by defeating Champion Bloodwrath, Champion Lightrend, Champion Swiftblade, and Champion Sunstriker in the pavilion near Master Kelerun Bloodmourn.

The Second Trial differs from the first in that there will be no surprises this time. The challenge before you is simple; you must face and best four Blood Knight champions in combat. When you accept the challenge, a crystal will appear in the middle of the pavilion. Touch it to begin your trial and do not stray far from the building. Are you prepared? "
5065,Forging the Weapon,Take the Crate of Materials to Bemarrin in Silvermoon City. ,"Once again, you have proven yourself worthy before the order and your peers. It is with great pleasure that I bestow upon you the rank of adept, <name>. Prince Kael'thas himself would be proud of you. Any of us would be honored to fight by your side on the field of battle. Continue to serve as an example for those who aspire to join us. Show neither mercy nor weakness, defend your people and your brothers tirelessly, and hone your mastery of the Light. Now, claim the weapon befitting your new rank. "
5066,A Gesture of Commitment,"Bring 40 Runecloth, 6 Arcanite Bars, 10 Sungrass, 5 Dark Runes, and 150 Gold to Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City. ","A Blood Knight's loyalty does not stop at the end of <his/her> blade, <name>. The order asks more of its members than mere drilling and combat. A true knight contributes to all of the order's activities, even the ones that may not seem glorious on the surface. This first task is neither combat intensive, nor glorious, but without such contributions, the order would fall apart. I will give you a list of items Magister Astalor Bloodsworn's men require to keep us supplied with Light energy for our magics. "
5067,The Tome of Divinity,Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind. ,"I'll take the script to the King's advisors after Duthorian's taken a look at them, but in the meantime, you should go speak to Duthorian now.

5068,The Tome of Valor,Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind. ,"Please, return to Duthorian and let him know that I'm safe for now. I have you and the Church to thank for that.

5069,Prove Your Hatred,Mehlar Dawnblade at the Bulwark wants you to bring him 20 Minion's Scourgestones. ,It is time you remembered history that should not be forgotten. . . the slaughter of our people by Arthas and his Scourge army. Vengeance on the Scourge is the only way to ease your pain.  It is unfortunate they are not susceptible to fear and pain.  Only their utter destruction will bring you even a shred of satisfaction. Speak with Argent Officer Garush for knowledge of scourgestones and how to obtain them -- I will need to see many of them as proof of your commitment before we speak again. 
5070,The Divination Scryer,Bring an Azerothian Diamond and a Pristine Black Diamond to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in the Cathedral District of Stormwind. ,"We now must assemble a Divination Scryer - this will begin the trial that will allow you to redeem the fallen charger.  Your scryer, actually, is almost done.  The exorcism censer used in Terrordale is the catalyst for it, and I will fashion a suitable housing for the device. The last components needed, though, are two diamonds.  They must be as juxtaposed in brilliance as they are in purpose - an Azerothian and a Pristine Black.  These two will be the beacon by which the scryer will pierce the shadows! "
5071,Exorcising Terrordale,Use the Exorcism Censer to drive out the spirits that torment Terrordale. ,"I have added a pinch of dirt from the tainted ground of Terrordale in the Eastern Plaguelands to the censer.  You will now use this censer to find areas there that show signs of spiritual turmoil and disturbance.  Look for green auras that permeate the ground as the physical world buckles under the torment of the spirit realm and use the censer to drive out the evil spirits. When you have passed sufficient judgment on the spirits there, you will be ready to proceed. "
5072,Judgment and Redemption,Use the Divination Scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement in the Scholomance. ,"Take this satchel - in it are the items you will need for your task. Use the divination scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement to bring forth accursed spirits that must be judged.  Use your judgments wisely during this trial - they will prove more potent than you realize.  After the spirits, the death knight will appear; defeat him and reclaim the lost soul of the charger.  Only then <name>, will you be able to redeem it and place your barding upon your new steed! Good luck! "
5073,The First Trial,"Travel to the island Knight-Lord Bloodvalor described, find the cave, and light the brazier. ","You have learned much of combat and bloodshed, initiate, but there is much more to our order. Mastery of the Light requires a focused mind and tremendous willpower. Without these, you are little better than a street thug. There is an island in the northeastern reaches of the Ghostlands, called the Isle of Tribulations, that we use to hone these skills. You will find a brazier within a shallow cave there. Kneel before the brazier, light it, and focus on what you see before your eyes. "
5074,The Tome of Valor,Find Daphne Stilwell in Westfall. ,"Good! Your lack of hesitation is a sure sign that you are prepared and eager to test yourself. So be it. At the very ends of Westfall's Longshore, a small house overlooks the ocean. There, a couple lives, the Stilwells. Jordan is an incredible smith, and he's gone to Ironforge to meet with the dwarves for a while. But this has left Daphne, his wife, alone and unprotected. Reports suggest that the Defias have all but taken over the area, Daphne may need some protection from the villains. Go there. "
5075,True Masters of the Light,"Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City wants you to bring him 1 Arcane Catalyst, 1 Crepuscular Powder, 1 Azerothian Diamond, and 1 Pristine Black Diamond. ","Now that we have the water, we're going to need a number of reagents in precise quantities. Some of these substances are rare and expensive, <name>, but I have located sources for two. You should be able to purchase some arcane catalyst from Zalle, the reagent vendor in one of the shops on the plaza near the Dead Scar. Darlia, the poison merchant near the rogue trainers on Murder Row, stocks crepuscular powder. To complete my mixture, I'll also need an azerothian diamond and a pristine black diamond. "
5076,A Demonstration of Loyalty,Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City wants you to destroy 3 Scourge Meat Wagons and kill 15 Scourge Siege Engineers. ,"We Blood Knights are bound to defend Quel'Thalas, <name>. This is a central part of your training. Our enemies are fierce and unrelenting. Silvermoon and its people remain free by our efforts and the support of our allies. I have received some disturbing reports of a renewed Scourge presence to the southeast of our border with the Eastern Plaguelands. A company of Scourge siege engineers and their equipment appear to be staging for an attack on the Ghostlands. They must not be permitted to succeed. "
5077,The Work of Grimand Elmore,Speak with Grimand Elmore in Stormwind's Dwarven District. ,"A paladin's charger is nothing more than a pack animal without proper barding for it.  The barding used by your charger not only needs to be of the finest materials possible, but because of the circumstances involved it must also be sufficiently attuned to the spirit realm. First things first, <name> - let's get your barding made.  In Stormwind's Dwarven District is one of the finest craftsmen living today, Grimand Elmore.  His work will not be cheap, but his quality is what we seek.  Speak with him. "
5078,True Masters of the Light,Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City wants you to bring him a vial of Tyr's Hand Holy Water. ,"A Blood Knight master possesses incredible skill at wielding and weaving the Light in a way that other so-called 'paladins' can never comprehend. It doesn't stop them from despising us for unleashing the Light's true potential. We must send them a message and show them that we are not to be trifled with. What I have in mind will be neither brief nor easy, but if you are committed, the first step will be to infiltrate the library wing of the Tyr's Hand Abbey and procure a vial of Tyr's Hand holy water. "
5079,Inert Scourgestones,Bring the Inert Scourgestone to Commander Ashlan Valorfist in Chillwind Point. ,"The evil has been purged from the stones, <name>. I am aware of Commander Ashlam's plans, and he will require only a single inert stone.  Bring it to him so we may bathe the Scourge in righteous fire. "
5080,A Summons from Lord Solanar,Speak with Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City. ,"Your dedication to our order and advancement through the ranks has not gone unnoticed. In fact, Lord Solanar Bloodwrath, Lady Liadrin's right hand and a hero in his own right, has asked to speak with you. This is a rare honor, <name>. Normally, Lord Solanar leaves the management of the order's rank-and-file to me, but he has taken a personal interest in you. Do not tarry, <name>. "
5081,The Tome of Nobility,Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind. ,"I greet you once again, <name>. I am more proud to call you <brother/sister> than ever before--your dedication is a tribute to us all. The time has come for me to bestow a great gift upon you. But know this, for now I give you this freely, but later, when time permits, this will be a much greater challenge to all paladins who choose to undertake my quest. Speak to me again and I shall grant you a great boon. "
5082,The Second Trial,Report to Master Kelerun Bloodmourn. ,"Initiate <name>, you have worked hard to master the powers of the Light won by our magisters. You have learned the source of our abilities and of the duties of a Blood Knight. The time has come for you to undergo the Second Trial, and contest for status as an adept among the Blood Knights. The trial will be administered by Master Kelerun Bloodmourn at a location north of the city. Travel north through the Ruins of Silvermoon and take the east path immediately before the bridge to Sunstrider Isle. "
5083,The Tome of Valor,Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind. ,"Valor, and all the virtues that go along with it, are like rare minerals: you must cherish them when you find them because of their value, but you must also take time to harvest them. . . refine them. When mixed together properly, a strong alloy is formed, sometimes unbreakable by even the most powerful blows. This strength, your faith, your bravery, must be tested. You must learn to never lose faith and realize that with the power of the Light, you can overcome things that most others cannot. "
5084,Summons from Knight-Lord Bloodvalor,Speak with Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Farstriders' Square in Silvermoon City. ,"<name>, you have excelled in your early training and distinguished yourself among those who would become Blood Knights. You are ready to undertake the next phase of your training and, to that end, Knight-Lord Bloodvalor himself has asked to speak with you. I have no doubt that Knight-Lord Bloodvalor wishes to set a trial for you to test your abilities and training. You will find him in the Blood Knight headquarters in Silvermoon City's Farstriders' Square. I wish you well, <name>. "
5085,The Tome of Divinity,Take the Symbol of Life to Gazin Tenorm in Stormwind. ,"Take this, <name>. It is called the Symbol of Life. You've proven charitable and patient, and now the time has come to see if you're powerful enough to focus one of the Light's greatest gifts. My friend Gazin returned recently from an encounter with some Defias in Elwynn near Heroes' Vigil--he barely escaped with his life. He's near the altar having his wounds healed by our priests. Take the Symbol and speak to him. If you can help him, then we will speak again soon. May you bask in the Light's glory. "
5086,Ancient Equine Spirit,Acquire special horse feed used for feeding a spirit horse. ,"Your barding needs a special form of blessing, one from an appropriate spirit.  In Dire Maul is such a spirit, the Ancient Equine Spirit.  It is currently held by a corrupt treant, Tendris Warpwood.  Pass judgment upon this foul beast, <name>. Know this - freedom alone is not enough.  You must soothe the spirit before receiving its blessing.  For that, special horse feed is needed.  Travel to Southshore first and speak with Merideth Carlson on this. . . and prepare for more sacrifice. "

Crusaders like you are a welcome sight in these desolate reaches. Your holy strength is needed to help fight the endless undead here.  We need you to collect a large number of scourgestones and bring them to High Priest Thel'danis.  The high priest can be found guarding Uther's Tomb in Sorrow Hill, not far from here.

The enchantment it bears will allow you to draw the last vestiges of the Light surrounding these magisters. They once tended the captive naaru and some of its energy yet remains within them. It will be just enough to restore your comrade to life. Do not worry about the magisters, <name>. I have seen to their care, and Lord Solanar assures me that Lady Liadrin seeks a new source of power even now. "
5093,The Tome of Divinity,Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind. ,"In all things, a paladin must reflect the Light which supplements our strength. To strive to be divine for one of our kind does not mean we strive for godhood--we strive to be good in all actions. Although called upon to smite evil in these harsh times, you must always remember that it's aiding others that will truly set you apart from the citizens of Azeroth.

When demons, dragons, or any other evil set foot in your lands, your mettle will be tested. Will you be strong enough? Bravery, regardless of the situation, is as much a part of paladinhood as the Light, your armor, and your weapon. Protecting the weak, and not losing faith are two more lessons you must master while you study in the Cathedral of Light. "
5096,The Symbol of Life,"Make haste, &lt; name&gt; , more than one life hangs in the balance if you fail. ","Make haste, <name>, more than one life hangs in the balance if you fail.

With her lies the knowledge to turn these remains into a weapon against the Scourge. "
5100,The Tome of Divinity,"Retrieve a Defias Script from the Defias Rogue Wizards in Elwynn, and return to Gazin Tenorm in Stormwind. ","We'll have time to talk more about the Symbol at a later time. What's important now is to get those papers we saw the Defias going over. If we can get our hands on them, we'll be able to prove the Defias have infiltrated Elwynn and hopefully gain some insight into what their plans are. I'm in no shape for battle as of now, <name>.

Stillblade knew well what he was being sent to do. He understood and accepted his duty and is an example for all aspiring Blood Knights. My words are no eulogy, <name>. Stillblade's service to us is far from over and you will be the instrument of his resurrection. Your education in the order's ways has just begun. With the betrayal of Kael'thas and the loss of our power source, you must learn new methods of wielding the Light. Seek out Magister Astalor Bloodsworn. "

I overheard him talking about how it was time you be put to the test some. . . along with some very complimentary things about how well you've performed thus far. If I were you, I'd head to Stormwind and speak to him when you have time. I'm sure he's in the Cathedral of Light--that's where he spends most of his time. "

","A Blood Knight's loyalty does not stop at the end of <his/her> blade, <name>. The order asks more of its members than mere drilling and combat.

There are those who would say what we're doing is wrong, but much of what has befallen us is also wrong. Would they have us throw away such a gift?

He wishes to know what organization this is and requires proof of it. I want you to speak with Andron, and obtain this information. You'll find him at his shop near the Apothecarium. "

5340,Call of Air,Speak with Susurrus at Wildwind Peak on Azuremyst Isle. ,"While air may seem ethereal, it is an all pervasive force, covering and permeating everything around us.

It is from him that you will gain understanding. "

It is the by-product of some demented research and you're going to put an end to it! Just to the southwest of the Foul Pool is a small camp.  There you will find the 'research' of Tel'athion the Impure.  This is where he produces the filth that has been seeping into the island's water.

5349,Call of Water,Find Brine at Blackthorn Ridge in Southern Barrens. ,"If there is one lesson you must learn of water, it is this: water means rebirth.

When you understand that water, when polluted, can devastate all that it touches, you will appreciate how vital a resource it is. If you wish the water sapta, find Brine deep in Southern Barrens.

I trust that you remember how to take the boat from Auberdine in Darkshore on Kalimdor back to the Exodar?  And that you remember where to find the farseer at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar, yes? "
5366,Rune-Inscribed Tablet,Speak to Shikrik in the Valley of Trials. ,"Ah, while you were gone a tablet came for you, <name>. Read it when you have time. If I'm not mistaken, it came from the shaman trainer Shikrik. She would have words with you when you're ready. "
5367,What Is Love? ,Retrieve the Wooden Figurine and bring it to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. ,"You will need a powerful reagent to tempt an incubus -- an object that represents great devotion and love.

With my scrying, I have located a small figurine that should be suitable for your ritual.

Thousands of years ago, the figurine belonged to a young couple. The original owners are no more, but their keepsake has survived to the present day.

Follow the road north into Ashenvale, then west and past Maestra's Post. You will see a house nestled amongst the trees. There you will find what you seek. "
5368,Wish You Were Here,Investigate Fallen Sky Lake in Ashenvale and report your findings to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar. ,"I met Krilge while making Mooncloth in Ashenvale. He was stationed there to protect civilians from danger, until he disappeared. . .

They've stopped looking for him and consider him a deserter, but I don't believe it.

We would often meet at Fallen Sky Lake before it became overrun by those aggressive bog beasts.

I'm not typically one to ask favors, but if you could go to Ashenvale and look for any sign of him, I'd appreciate it. "
5369,Tome of the Cabal,Retrieve the Moldy Tome and Tattered Manuscript for Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge. ,"It was lost, but there's some idea as to where it might be found. There was only one copy ever made and it was vandalized at some point, a large portion of it ripped from the binding. Rumor has it that it somehow passed into the hands of the centaur of Thousand Needles. The rest was lost off the coast west of Southshore, where it was to be transported to Menethil Harbor by boat. It never arrived. In exchange for this knowledge, all I ask is that if you find it, bring it to me to see. "
5370,Hearts of the Lovers,Bring the hearts of Avelina Lilly and Isaac Pearson to Carendin Halgar in the Temple of the Damned. ,"An incubus will be drawn to the hearts of lovers, and the most aching love will create the most irresistible lure. My scrying has revealed two that should serve exceptionally. In Silverpine Forest, Avelina Lilly provides her tailoring services to the fallen wizards at Ambermill. In the Barrens, Isaac Pearson hopes to make his mark in the seaside town of Ratchet. They toil on opposite ends of the world, yet their hearts yearn only for each other. Bring those hearts to Carendin. "
5371,Flawless Fel Essence,Impsy in Felwood has asked that you bring him three Flawless Fel Essences originating from three distinct locations. ,"If you're going to reanimate Kroshius, you're going to need Fel fire. I can make Fel fire but it's going to require some components. You need to bring me flawless Fel essences from three distinct regions of the world. The Legashi Satyrs of Azshara will have the first essence type; the Jaedenar legionnaires of Jaedenar the second type and the felguard sentries of the Blasted Lands the third. Bring me back one of each essence type and I will create the Fel fire, allowing you to reanimate Kroshius. "
5372,The Binding,"Using the Bloodstone Choker, summon and subdue a voidwalker, then return the Bloodstone Choker to Gakin the Darkbinder in Stormwind. ","By retrieving my choker and besting Surena, you've proven that you're at least as capable as she was. With that said, I can tell you're direly in need of training. You can manage the flows of magic, yes, but being a warlock is much more than that. I will show you how to command a voidwalker, but before I can, you must call one forth at a summoning circle and subdue it using whatever weapons--physical and magical--you have at your disposal. Use the magic of this choker at the summoning circle below. "
5373,The Binding,"Using the Tome of the Cabal, summon and subdue a felhunter, then return the Tome of the Cabal to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet. ","If you are sufficiently prepared, then we should begin. Let me explain the process to you. I will begin by creating the basic summoning circle. When that is finished, my acolytes will use the rods of channeling to create the greater circle. Once that is done, read the incantation from the Tome of the Cabal, and the felhunter will be pulled forth. Be careful, <name>. A felhunter is a powerful foe, and I'd like to see you keep your head on your shoulders. "
5374,Kroshius' Infernal Core,Search Shatter Scar Vale in Felwood for the remains of Kroshius. ,"Kroshius lays in a heap to the northeast, in the Shatter Scar Vale. Take this Fel fire and use it on his remains. The fire should reanimate the fallen infernal. At this point, I fully expect him to kill you and your minion. If by some miracle you happen to kill Kroshius, take his infernal core and return it to Niby. "
5375,Hearts of the Pure,Bring the hearts of Dalin Forgewright and Corma Villard to Carendin Halgar in the Temple of the Damned. ,"Coaxing a succubus will require the hearts of the pure. But is any mortal without vice? Through bits of overheard stories, I found two humans that should do. The first is Dalin Forgewright, who has dedicated himself to the care of the Lordaeron refuges, whom are refused by their kin at the Greymane Wall. The other is Corma Villard, a woman who remains faithful to her lost love, wandering the Wetlands for a sign of her. Deliver their hearts to Carendin. But first, let me show you your quarry. "
5376,Surena Caledon,Retrieve Surena's Choker for Gakin the Darkbinder in Stormwind. ,"I had a student named Surena Caledon. She stood where you stand now, eager to learn of warlock magic, and possessing no small bit of talent. More than that she was young and pleasing to the eye. Had I seen it then, the traitorous trollop! The thieving wench ran off with one of the Defias, Erlan Drudgemoor. While her loss is of little importance, I gifted her a bloodstone choker that I must have. Her life means nothing to me now. You will find her at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch. Retrieve what is mine. "
5377,Devourer of Souls,Speak with Takar the Seer in the Barrens. ,"A sayaad is a devourer of souls, dominator of wills, and tempter of hearts. It knows nothing but evil.

Salacious tales refer to the demon by its common name: succubus for females, incubus for males.

A stimulus is required to beckon the creature. With a symbol of love as bait, it will surely answer your call. Defeat it, and make it your tool.

It will be hard to find a thing of this nature, though. You should speak with Takar the Seer. You will find him in the Barrens of Kalimdor near Camp Taurajo. "
5378,Trolls of a Feather,Bring a total of 6 Voodoo Feathers from the trolls in sunken temple. ,"My pet is almost done.  Now I just need something to stuff it with. Only the voodoo feathers from the trolls in the sunken temple will do.  They go by the names Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro.  Kill them.  Kill them all. This is no trivial task <name>, so I'll make it worth your while by giving you something of Niby's -- he probably doesn't need it anyhow. "
5379,An Imp's Request,Bring a piece of felcloth to Impsy in Felwood. ,"<name>, an imp in Felwood by the name of Impsy has requested your presence.  It is somewhat strange, as he has asked that you bring a piece of felcloth as a sign of good faith.  Considering the power you already wield as a warlock, I can only assume you know the satyrs of Felwood carry this felcloth. You can find Impsy just north of the Bloodvenom Falls, which I've heard is quite lovely this time of year. "
5380,Heartswood,Retrieve the Heartswood from Ashenvale and bring it to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. ,"In preparation for your coming, I used my sight to look over the world and through the mists of time. I have found what it is you seek. In the War of the Ancients, two lovers fell together in battle. Where they took their last breaths, a tree known as the heartswood grew, a symbol of their undying love. That should be enough to tempt a succubus. You will find it in the ruins of Ordil'Aran in the northwestern part of the forest of Ashenvale. "
5381,Imp Delivery,Bring the Imp in a Jar to the alchemy lab in the Scholomance. ,"There is one more process required for Mor'zul's parchment; I need paper infused with Xorothian stardust.  And. . . I'm afraid I can't do that here.  I don't have the equipment! There is an alchemy lab, however, with everything needed.  It's in the Scholomance, on the isle of Caer Darrow in the Plaguelands. I can't make the trip, but here - take this jar.  There's an imp inside who is quite clever.  Let him out at the alchemy lab and he'll infuse the parchment. "
5382,Tome of the Cabal,Bring the Reconstructed Tome and 3 Rods of Channeling to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet. ,"Well, ah, it's hard to let it go. But you found it, and you have more important things to do with it, of course. Just, please, be sure to mention to Strahad that I wanted a copy. While you were out, he sent a message for you. He wanted me to tell you that for his acolytes to assist with the summoning, you'll have to acquire three rods of channeling. He might not know where to find them, but I do! They were last used by the orcs of the Dragonmaw clan in the Wetlands. I'd check their spellcasters! "
5383,Summon Felsteed,Speak to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet to learn the ability to summon a Felsteed. ,"I would give you a reward for your patience and hard work. But know this, the ability to summon a Felsteed will be much more difficult in the future. You will have to earn it. . . and it will not be easy. For now, go with the power to summon such a creature and use it as you see fit. "
5384,The Binding,"Using the Withered Scarf, summon and subdue an incubus, then return the Withered Scarf to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar. ","Yes. . . I see. I feel the residual emotions bound within these threads. Love is woven into its stitches. The incubus will not be able to resist.

Take this to the summoning circle in Neeru's tent, <name>. Summon forth a malevolent incubus, then show it your mastery. Do not expect it to be subdued quietly. Ready your magic and prepare yourself for a fight. Underestimating a demon has been many a warlock's final mistake.

When you have defeated it, return the cloth to me. I will let Magar know what you found. "
5385,Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe,Bring Robes of the Arcana to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"The first item I will aid you in creating is a robe. You will gather the items for me, and we will put them together. Afterwards, assuming you succeed, you will have the first of many items that will make you more powerful and aid you in your struggles. To start, you must have crafted Robes of Arcana. A tailor can make this for you, or perhaps you can purchase one from someone else--I'd be most impressed if you could make it yourself--but regardless, bring me the robes, and we shall go from there. "
5386,Shard of a Felhound,Take the Felhas Ruby and use it on one of the Felhounds found in Desolace. ,"So, you have chosen to capture the soul of a felhound, good. Take this ruby--with it, you will be able to capture the creature's soul. It works very similar to spells you already know: when the creature is close to dying, use the gem and it should do the rest of the work for you. I would suggest going to Desolace and trying your hand at any of the felhounds there. Those should do nicely. After you're successful, take both the captured spirit and your ruby to Menara. "
5387,Seeking Strahad,Speak with Strahad Farsan in the Barrens. ,"It is time you learned the felhunter summoning, <name>. I do not have the reagents and items necessary to teach you here, so you will have to seek out another, Strahad Farsan, another of our inner circle. He makes his residence in the goblin port of Ratchet. I will send word ahead of you to inform him of your coming. "
5388,Dreadsteed of Xoroth,Read Mor'zul's Instructions. ,"All the preparations are made.  Now, you must perform the ritual to create a Circle of Greater Summoning, then use the parchment infused with Xorothian stardust. . . to open a portal to Xoroth. I have written the instructions for the ritual onto a scroll.  Study it closely, for you must perform each step exactly if you wish to succeed. Fortune to you, <name>.  And may the souls of your enemies swiftly find their way into your shard pouch. "
5389,Devourer of Souls,Speak with Cazul in the Cleft of Shadow. ,"The time has come for you to learn more of the summoning magics. You will learn to summon a sayaad, a creature of incredible mental powers. It can lull those of weak minds into its servitude--but have no fear! I feel certain that you will be equal to the challenge. A sayaad can only be summoned when baited with an item that represents great devotion and love. I leave it to you to find such an object. A suggestion? Speak with Cazul. . . There seems to be little the ancient warlock does not know. "
5390,The Completed Robe,Wait for Menara Voidrender to complete your robe and then speak to her again. ,I will put the robe together for you now. It will take but a few moments. Do not go far. 
5391,Tome of the Cabal,Speak with Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge. ,"It will take more than a simple summoning circle to bring forth a felhunter for you to challenge. My three acolytes and I will assist in creating the magic circles. You require a copy of the Tome of the Cabal, which has been lost to us for some time. It was written by the first group of warlocks to summon a felhunter unaided. Perhaps Krom Stoutarm can help you with this. An itinerant warlock these days, he spends his days hoarding ancient texts and skulking about the library in Ironforge. "
5392,Shard of an Infernal,Take the Infus Emerald and use it on one of the Infernals found in Desolace. ,"So, you have chosen to capture the soul of an infernal, good. Take this emerald--with it, you will be able to capture the creature's soul. It works very similar to spells you already know: when the creature is close to dying, use the gem and it should do the rest of the work for you. I would suggest going to Desolace and trying your hand at any of the infernals there. Those should do nicely. After you're successful, take both the captured spirit and your emerald to Menara. "
5393,The Binding,"Using the Wooden Figurine, summon and subdue an incubus, then return the Wooden Figurine to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Slaughtered Lamb. ","The time has come. Take the figurine and descend into the crypts below. A summoning circle has been prepared, and you must place the figurine at its center.

Then the gateway will open, and the incubus will cross into our world.

A sayaad is not to be underestimated. The demon will not hesitate to attack when it realizes your ruse. You must draw upon all you have been taught to defeat it.

If you succeed, return to me and I shall bind the creature to your will. Fail, and your soul is forfeit. "
5394,Rage of Blood,Bring 30 bottles of Raging Beast's Blood to Mor'zul Bloodbringer in the Burning Steppes. ,"The dreadsteeds dwell on another world, on the fiery Plains of Xoroth, and to bind one of those famed beasts you must invoke powerful glyphs.  I can scribe the glyphs on a parchment for you, but first I will need a special ink. In distant Winterspring there dwells a race of owl beasts.  Once pure creatures, they were turned mad by the demonic emanations of the Darkwhisper Gorge and now roam the snows in a frenzy. Their blood is what I need to ink your parchment.  Bring it to me. "
5395,Gakin's Summons,Report to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. ,"Isn't that how it always works? Was looking for you all day and couldn't find you, now when I'm not expecting it, you come and walk right up to me. I've wasted enough time trying to find you, so I won't delay you any longer. Master Gakin's summoned you for additional training. Seems to me you should seek him out as soon as possible. You'll find him in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb tavern. By the way, you might want to keep that particular location quiet. Don't want word spreading about it. "
5396,The Binding,"Using the Lovers' Hearts, summon and subdue an incubus, then return the Lovers' Hearts to Carendin Halgar in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity. ","The time has come at last. Bring the hearts to the summoning circle below. Place them at its center and call forth the incubus. The demon will not be pleased when it realizes that you have tempted it into a trap. Do not fall prey to its beguilement, <name>. You must subdue it fully. Only then can I teach you the spell to bind it to your will. "
5397,Devourer of Souls,Speak with Godrick Farsan in the Temple of the Damned. ,"A sayaad is a devourer of souls, dominator of wills, tempter of hearts. A creature of profound evil and singular mind. Folk tales told by righteous and wicked alike use their common name: succubus for females, incubus for males. The demon must be lured into our world with a stimulus - the hearts of pure and loving mortals. The sayaad will be unable to resist. Then you can dominate it, and make it your own. Speak with my assistant, Godrick Farsan, within the temple. He will help you find your bait. "
5398,What Niby Commands,Speak with Impsy in Felwood. ,"If I am to teach you the secrets of summoning an infernal servant, you must destroy Kroshius and bring me the infernal core from his burning remains. This, however, is not as easy as it sounds. Kroshius has all but burned out completely. You must reignite his corpse and raise him from the rubble. To do this, however, you must gather some components from other demonic entities. My imp, Impsy, shall set you on your way. "
5399,The Slaughtered Lamb,Report to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. ,"Hmph. Times past, all warlocks in Khaz Modan were trained under the auspices of the masters of Gnomeregan, but now that we've all been forced to relocate into this rat's hole in Ironforge, and Magni's decided to keep a careful watch on us, we're forced to send our novices to Stormwind for training. Luckily, Gakin's no slouch, so you'll still learn what you need to know, but it burns my blood! Anyways, you'll find Gakin in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb in Stormwind. "
5400,Lord Banehollow,Purchase Shadowy Potions from Gorzeeki Wildeyes at the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes. ,"Mor'zul says that you want to open a portal to Xoroth.  To do that, you'll need Xorothian stardust.  That's not easy to find on Azeroth! There is one being who might have some: Lord Banehollow in Jaedenar, the seat of the Shadow Council!  Speak with him and he might part with the stardust. But if you're going to Jaedenar, then you'll need to cloak yourself in the Shadow Council's own flavor of evil.  That will require some of my shadowy potions, and that will cost you. . . "
5401,The Binding,"Using the Pure Hearts, summon and subdue a succubus, then return the Pure Hearts to Carendin Halgar in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity. ","Using these hearts, cast a spell at the summoning circle to open a doorway for the succubus to come through. Your powers are greater now, and you will need all of them to defeat the succubus. Beware its charms, <name>, many a strong mind has been bound to its will. When overcome, the succubus will be returned to the void, and I will teach you the spell to summon it forth at your command. "
5402,Creature of the Void,Recover Egalin's Grimoire and bring it to Carendin Halgar in the Temple of the Damned. ,"It seems the consensus that you are ready to learn to summon a voidwalker. A being created of the chaos that lies beyond, if you summon one but cannot control it, you will be torn asunder. The first voidwalker was summoned by Egalin, and in his grimoire is the process explained. Unfortunately, it was stolen from us by an agent of the Scarlet Crusade who has it secreted away in his base at a tower to the west. Bring it to me, and I will impart the knowledge to you. "
5403,Tome of the Cabal,Retrieve the Moldy Tome and Tattered Manuscript for Jorah Annison in the Undercity. ,"Ah! I see that you are a warlock of similar tastes to mine. Indeed, acquiring the Tome of the Cabal is a worthy aspiration. Did you know that it was once held within the walls of Lordaeron? It was vandalized though, almost half its pages removed. Who would commit such a heinous act? That half is lost, though rumor says that it fell into the hands of the centaur of the Thousand Needles. The rest of the text was to be transferred to Ironforge, but was lost in transit on the coast west of Southshore. "
5404,Mor'zul Bloodbringer,Speak with Mor'zul Bloodbringer at the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes. ,"<name>, your delvings into the dark arts are deep.  Your mastery over otherworldly denizens has grown so strong. . . perhaps you are ready to bind to you one of the infamous dreadsteeds. The ritual to summon the beast from its home requires great power and resources, but if you desire to dominate that epic mount, then speak with Mor'zul Bloodbringer.  He is camped near the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes. Go, <name>.  This quest will be perilous, but a Warlock of your stature does not shy from danger! "
5405,Fragments of the Orb of Orahil,Speak to Menara's acolytes inside the tower above Ratchet and choose one of their paths to follow. ,"Good, then we shall begin. The first thing you must do is speak to my acolytes inside. Choose one of their paths to follow--they will explain more. Second, you must travel to Desolace and find an Infernal Orb from one of the warlocks of Mannoroc Coven. It is that orb that you will cleanse with the help of a mage named Tabetha deep in southern Dustwallow Marsh. She will aid you because of our history together. Again, do not come back until you have done both things I've asked. "
5406,The Wrong Stuff,Bring 10 Rotting Wood and 4 Bloodvenom Essence to Impsy in Felwood. ,"Now that I have my felcloth, I can really begin making *my* pet. It's going to need some eyes though.  Perhaps you could rip some rotting wood from the irontree folk for me, so I can carve out some lovely eyes.  They're up north in the Irontree Woods. I'll also need some bloodvenom essence to give it that new demon smell.  The tainted oozes carry the essence, and they hang out right here near Niby and me. "
5407,Ulathek the Traitor,"Confront Ulathek, then bring The Traitor's Heart to Lord Banehollow in Jaedenar. ","You wish to enter my good graces?  Then kill for me. My servant, Ulathek, is pathetic how he grovels before me, all the while plotting with Lord Hel'nurath on Xoroth.  Hel'nurath plans to usurp my power here, and Ulathek is his spy. . . Prove that you serve me and not my rivals.  Confront Ulathek in his quarters, in the Shadow Hold to the west.  Tell him that I know his secret and watch as fear grips him.  Then, bring me the traitor's heart! "
5408,Arcanite,Bring 1 Arcanite Bar to Gorzeeki in the Burning Steppes. ,"Now that the Bell, Wheel and Candle are made, I should make a black lodestone.  During your ritual, you'll need that lodestone to maintain the other ritual objects if they should fail. To make the lodestone, I require arcanite.  Do you have any?  If not, then. . . you'll have to get the arcanite from an alchemist. Return to me when you have the arcanite, and then I'll make the black lodestone. "
5409,The Binding,"Using Dogran's Pendant, summon and subdue a succubus, then return Dogran's Pendant to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar. ","Take this to the summoning circle in Neeru's tent, <name>. Summon forth a foul succubus, then show it your mastery. I believe in the strength of your magic. As always, though, be wary, for pride and overconfidence has overcome many a promising warlock. When you have defeated it, return the pendant to me so that I might deliver the news to Zankaja. "
5410,Returning the Cleansed Orb,Return the Cleansed Infernal Orb to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Take the cleansed orb back to Menara in Ratchet, <name>. Give her my regards and be safe. I truly hope you are able to withstand the temptation and corruption that is sure to come as you follow your path. Good luck. "
5411,Creature of the Void,Retrieve the Tablet of Verga for Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar. ,"So few warlocks remain. . . We risk much, but the risks are warranted. You must quickly reach maturity in your ability if you are to be of use to the Horde and to the Warchief. It is time that you learned a new summoning spell. First, you must recover the Tablet of Verga, which was stolen by warlocks of the Burning Blade and is now kept at their lair in Skull Rock to the east of the city. With the tablet, I will show you the runes necessary to summoning a voidwalker. "
5412,The Binding,"Using the Heartswood Core, summon and subdue a succubus, then return the Heartswood Core to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Slaughtered Lamb. ","Using the heartswood core, you will be able to cast a spell at the summoning circle in the crypt below to open a portal for the succubus to pass through. Be careful, <name>, succubi have overrun even the strongest of minds. Once you have bested and returned it to the void, return to me and I will show you how to call and control it. "
5413,Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe,Bring 10 Vials of Hatefury Blood and 1 Lesser Infernal Stone to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"The next components are found in Desolace, far to the west of the Barrens and even the Stonetalon Mountains. There, chaos still reigns after the Sundering. Both your strength and cunning will be tested there--you will face creatures of hatred and also of the Burning Legion. From the Hatefury satyr in the northeast, bring me their blood. From the lesser infernals in Mannoroc Coven, bring me a lesser infernal stone. We will use both in the construction of your robe. "
5414,Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe,"Bring some Fine Gold Thread, 2 Smoldering Coals, and a Soul Shard to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ","I need only three things now, <name>, then we can finish your robe. First, the fine gold thread Xizk is making for you. Return to him in Booty Bay and get it. Second, bring me two smoldering coals from the fire elementals in the Arathi Highlands. If I recall correctly, they are to the west, near Thoradin's Wall. Finally, a soul shard created by you. After you have all the components, return here to the tower and I will complete the robe for you. "
5415,Wildeyes,Bring the Case of Blood to Gorzeeki Wildeyes at the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes. ,"My servant, Gorzeeki, is an alchemist of some skill.  He can prepare the ink I will need for your parchment.  I gathered together the blood you acquired; take it to Gorzeeki so that he can begin his work. "
5416,Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe,Bring a Gold Bar to Xizk Goodstitch in Stranglethorn Vale. ,"Your next task is as simple as your first, but will require you to seek out aid. I require gold thread for the embroidery of the cloak, but gold thread is not easy to come by, and very few know how to make it. Fortunately, one who is loyal to our cause knows its secrets and is willing to help those rising in our ranks. Bring a gold bar to Xizk Goodstitch in Booty Bay. He is a master tailor and will be happy to spin the thread for you. Gold bars are smelted by skilled miners. Ask a miner for help. "
5417,Love's Gift,Bring the Dirt-caked Pendant to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar. ,"Zankaja is young and beautiful. To be chained to an invalid. . . I will not allow her to suffer that injustice. Leave me, <name>. And thank you. I may end my life in glorious battle, instead of a lifeless husk. And please, I would ask you not to tell my mate of this. . . I do not want guilt on her conscience. "
5418,The Completed Orb of Dar'Orahil,Wait for Menara Voidrender to complete the Orb of Dar'Orahil and then speak to her again. ,"I will get started immediately on crafting your orb and infusing your new demon into it. When done, you will have the choice of having it in the form of a staff or orb. I always felt it was important to cater to a warlock's chosen weapon. . . I see no reason not to continue that practice. "
5419,The Rune of Summoning,"Use the Voidstone to summon a Voidwalker in Goldenmist Village, defeat it, and return to Talionia in Silvermoon City. ","The voidstone reveals a vision of a multi-story building haunted by ghostly figures.  As the scene sharpens and blurs, other buildings come into view, leading you to believe it is Goldenmist Village. Rooftops and tree canopies suddenly flash by, revealing the way to Goldenmist by following the Elrendar River to the west. Once there, use the voidstone near the rune of summoning atop the center building and defeat the summoned voidwalker.  Only then can you return to your teacher. "
5420,Summon Felsteed,Speak to Strahad Farsan in the Barrens. ,"Hmph. I say you're not prepared, but that is not my decision. Strahad feels otherwise, and it is his decision to make. . . this time. He wishes to speak to you, and quickly. You'll find him still above Ratchet in the Barrens, at his little tower there with his acolytes. Do not dawdle long. "
5421,Seeking Strahad,Speak to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet. ,"I have taught you skills in the past, but the time has come for another to teach you. He is in Ratchet, and his name is Strahad. He is human, but do not let that fool you into thinking he is weak. He is powerful even though he may be small. He can teach you about more powerful summonings--I feel you are ready. Go to him now. He is in Ratchet. . . above the port town next to his tower. "
5422,Doomsday Candle,Bring 3 Black Dragonscales to Gorzeeki Wildeyes in the Burning Steppes. ,"A Doomsday Candle stores fire and directs it at those who would disrupt your ritual.  When creating your Circle of Greater Summoning, if your candle is lit then any wayward demons will be burned by its flames! Containing that fire is not easy, and requires the essence within the scales of a black dragon.  Acquire those scales from a skinner and bring them to Gorzeeki Wildeyes. "
5423,Dogran's Captivity,Bring Ken'zigla's Draught to Dogran in the Barrens. ,"You've made it this far, so if you want to see this through to the end, I won't stop you. I can't spare you any additional manpower though, you'll be on your own. Dogran is being held in a quilboar camp to the north of here. Look for a group of two huts. He'll be heavily guarded--that is, if they haven't killed him yet, or he hasn't succumbed to his wounds. Good luck. "
5424,Xorothian Stardust,Purchase Xorothian Stardust from Ur'dan inside the Shadow Hold at Jaedenar in Felwood. ,"So you come to me seeking Xorothian stardust?  You wish to open a portal to Xoroth, the domain of Hel'nurath my rival?  Perhaps you plan to steal from him one of his precious dreadsteeds? Very well.  My servant Ur'dan has a supply of Xorothian stardust.  You may obtain it from him. . . if you can pay the price. "
5425,The Stone,Obtain a Voidstone from the Dead Scar. ,"While I'm certain your imp has proven a useful and sometimes entertaining servant, it is time you mastered a more powerful demon: the voidwalker. Travel down the Dead Scar until it is crossed by the Elrendar River.  Just south of the river, locate one of the blue glowing stones and take it.  Your path will be revealed there. "
5426,News of Dogran,Speak with Ken'zigla at the Malaka'jin. ,"He was stationed at Camp Taurajo, where we've been trying to weed out the quilboar. He led a few grunts to one of their camps, where he was hurt bad. The others made it back and tried to rescue him. He was in bad shape, his wounds festered, so they were afraid to move him without patching him up first. They sent a message here, requesting a healing draught from the trolls at the Malaka'jin at the base of the Stonetalon Mountains. We sent someone to get it, but they haven't returned yet. "
5427,Tome of the Cabal,Speak with Jorah Annison in the Undercity. ,"It will take more than a simple summoning circle to bring forth a felhunter for you to challenge. My three acolytes and I will assist in creating the magic circles. You require a copy of the Tome of the Cabal, which has been lost to us for some time. It was written by the first group of warlocks to summon a felhunter unaided. Perhaps Jorah Annison can help you with this. He's employed as a cartographer in the Undercity these days, but still knows more of ancient texts than any I know. "
5428,In Search of Menara Voidrender,Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Hmph, still you strive to become more powerful. I say it's only time before the corruption and addiction takes hold of you and you become a slave to that which you seek to gain power over. Pfah! A fool you are! Time will prove me right--nothing else. . . just time. But it seems that not all agree with Zevrost. It seems Menara would create tools for you to become more powerful and to harness your strength. If you're interested, then go to Ratchet in the Barrens. She is there overlooking the town. "
5429,News of Dogran,Speak with Gazrog at the Crossroads. ,"My mate, Dogran, was recently sent to the Crossroads for duty. It was a promotion, and he was very proud. I was sad, of course, but I didn't let him know that. And worried, too. The Barrens is a more dangerous place than Orgrimmar, and I feared the worst. Now it's been a week after he should have returned, and I have received no word from him. . . Perhaps you could go to the Crossroads and see if they have any news? He worked with Gazrog, who should still be stationed there. "
5430,Love Hurts,Speak with Magar in Orgrimmar. ,"A sayaad male is known as an incubus. A creature of profound evil and singular mind.

The demon must be lured into our world with an item of enticement - an object that represents great love and devotion.

If you trust a blind man to lead you, <name>, then listen. East from the Cleft of Shadow, along the main drag of Orgrimmar, lives Magar. He longs for the return of his mate, Krilge.

Seek him out. He'll ask you to search for something precious. That is the key which you must bring to Gan'rul. "
5431,Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe,Return to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Return to Menara, tell her it'll take some time, but I'll make sure to come through for her. . . and you. Tell her to have you finish gathering the rest of your components--I should have the thread done by then. You can return and pick it up then. Good luck, <name>. Oh, and say hello to Strahad for me while you're there. That old coot. . . putting a tower right there next to Ratchet. . . crazy. "
5432,Tome of the Cabal,Bring the Reconstructed Tome and 3 Rods of Channeling to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet. ,"This is one of the most interesting texts I have perused in the last few years. The selection here is sparse--mostly books on geography--and I have already read them all. I should hope that Strahad would send me a copy of this tome when he has the chance. Speaking of him, he sent word to me while you were away. For your task, you must obtain three rods of channeling. For allowing me to look at this text, I will share a secret: You can find the rods on orcs of the Dragonmaw Clan in the Wetlands. "
5433,Wheel of the Black March,Bring 6 Large Brilliant Shards and 25 Dark Iron Ore to Gorzeeki in the Burning Steppes. ,"A Wheel of the Black March contains and directs the violent energies required for the Circle of Greater Summoning.  For Gozeeki to construct a wheel, he will need both large brilliant shards from an enchanter, and dark iron ore from a master miner. Acquire these and bring them to my servant. "
5434,The Binding,"Using the Glyphs of Summoning, summon and subdue a voidwalker, then return the Glyphs of Summoning to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar. ","Now, observe the Tablet of Verga, for it contains the glyphs you will need for the summoning. Take them to the circle in Neeru Fireblade's tent on the other side of the cavern. There you will be able to call for the voidwalker. You must defeat it using whatever physical and magical means you have at your disposal. When this is completed, return to me with the glyphs of summoning and I will demonstrate how you may bind the creature to your will. "
5435,The Prison's Bindings,Travel to Dire Maul in Feralas and recover 15 Satyr Blood from the Wildspawn Satyr that inhabit the Warpwood Quarter. ,You must retrieve bindings for the prison of the Doomguard from lesser demons. The blood of the Wildspawn satyr that occupy Dire Maul should do nicely. The coagulated blood will bond the Hederine shards and power the crystal prison. 
5436,Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil,Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Well, well, well. . . a pleasure to see you're growing in power, <name>. I'd wager you'd be about ready to speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. If you haven't spoken to her before, then let me tell you, I don't think I've ever met another expert in the creation of items--orbs specifically--that can inprison even a demon to serve our will so easily. If you're interested, she's in Strahad's tower above Ratchet in the Barrens. "
5437,Carendin Summons,Speak with Carendin Halgar in Undercity. ,"You have a hungry look about you, <name>.  Perhaps it is time you advanced your training. Travel to Undercity and speak with Carendin Halgar, the old bag of bones knows a trick or two you might find useful. "
5438,The Completed Orb of Noh'Orahil,Wait for Menara Voidrender to complete the Orb of Noh'Orahil and then speak to her again. ,"I will get started immediately on crafting your orb and infusing your new demon into it. When done, you will have the choice of having it in the form of a staff or orb. I always felt it was important to cater to a warlock's chosen weapon. . . I see no reason not to continue that practice. "
5439,Warlock Training,Speak with Summoner Teli'Larien - the Warlock class trainer - inside the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle. ,"As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you.  For young warlocks here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Summoner Teli'Larien.  Speak with Summoner Teli'Larien and see what training he has available for you.  The things he will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you. Your trainer - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level. "
5440,Gan'rul's Summons,Speak with Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar. ,"You there. <name>, right? I hope your schedule isn't busy, because Gan'rul wants to see you right away. You'll find him with the senior warlocks in the Cleft of Shadow. Based on my past dealings with Gan'rul, your summons is either a very good thing or a very bad thing. "
5441,Suppression,Venture forth into the Tainted Scar and locate a Doomguard Commander. ,"The prison is ready. Now for the most difficult portion of this task. You must find and capture a Doomguard Commander within the Tainted Scar using this crystal prison. Be warned! A Doomguard is a cunning and lethal adversary and will seek to destroy you as you begin the ritual of imprisonment. It will flail wildly in its attempts to escape imprisonment. It will focus on nothing but you, <name>. Because of this, I must recommend that you take companions capable of keeping you alive! "
5442,In Search of Menara Voidrender,Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Ah, hello, <name>. You're progressing well in your training. So well in fact that I think you should be rewarded for your hard work--and for not becoming corrupted by the arcane yet. If you're interested, seek out Menara Voidrender in Ratchet. She is currently staying at Strahad Farsan's tower overlooking the town. She's not very friendly, <name>, so don't expect any praise. But if you work hard, she'll make sure you're taken care of. "
5443,Ken'zigla's Draught,Bring Ken'zigla's Draught to Grunt Logmar at Camp Taurajo. ,"I figured there might be another coming to get the draught, so I prepared it anyways. Here you go, <name>. Mind you, you should only give half of it to him! That will give him enough strength to move without bleeding himself dry. Wait a night, then give him the other half. Anyways, you'll want to bring this to Logmar at Camp Taurajo. From what the first one told me, he should have an idea where this Dogran is. "
5444,Bell of Dethmoora,Bring 2 Elixirs of Shadow Power to Gorzeeki Wildeyes in the Burning Steppes. ,"A Bell of Dethmoora, named after the late warlock Dethmoora Darkeyes, is one of the three tools needed to create a Circle of Greater Summoning.  When properly atuned with the Wheel and the Candle, these items conduct vast stores of arcane power. My servant Gorzeeki can construct such a bell, but to do so he will need a large supply of elixirs of shadow power.  Procure the elixirs from an alchemist and bring them to Gorzeeki. "
5445,Gakin's Summons,Report to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. ,"<name>! Didn't expect to see you around these parts, but I was instructed to keep an eye out for you. It's past time you got some more training, so you should stop in to see Gakin the next time you're in Stormwind. He'll be waiting for you. "
5446,Summon Felsteed,Speak to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet. ,"You, <race>! Come here! You're the one they call <name>, yes? I thought as much. I will keep this short: you're growing in power, and it has been acknowledged. And now, the time has come that you are rewarded for your efforts. Go to the Barrens. There, above Ratchet, you'll find Strahad Farsan --perhaps you remember him? He would have words with you. I wouldn't take long. "
5447,Tainted Scroll,Read the Tainted Scroll and speak to Maximillion in Deathknell. ,"Ah, while you were off dealing with the mindless Scourge, this scroll arrived for you. I would think it's some matter of importance as it seems it bears the seal of the warlock trainer Maximillion. I would take some time to read it before heading out again. "
5448,Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil,Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Hmm, you've made it this far. . . truly astonishing. I would have thought the corruption of channeling the arcane would have seeped into your very soul and driven you mad by now. How about we try and push you further then? If you want to test your skill, seek out Menara Voidrender above Ratchet in Strahad's tower. She will guide you. "
5449,Blind Cazul,Speak with Zankaja in Orgrimmar. ,"If Gan'rul has sent you to me, it must be that you are to summon a succubus, a female of the sayaad race, and need an object to use for enticement.

Hmm. . . If you trust a blind man to lead you, <name>, then listen. In the bluffs of Orgrimmar, west of the wind rider tower, lives Zankaja. She waits for the return of her mate.

Go to her. "
5450,Hot and Itchy,Bring a piece of felcloth to Impsy in Felwood. ,"Maybe this sounds strange coming from an imp, but I'd like a pet of my own.  I really would.  It's just not fair that Niby gets me and I get nothing! In fact, it doesn't even need to be a living pet.  I'd need something to start making it with, like some felcloth.  The satyrs here in Felwood sometimes have felcloth, so you'd just have to kill enough of them until you find some.  That doesn't sound so bad, does it? "
5451,Seeking Strahad,Find Strahad Farsan in Ratchet. ,"I have taught you skills in the past, but the time has come for another to teach you. He is in Ratchet, and his name is Strahad. He is human, but do not let that fool you into thinking he is weak, nor is he your enemy. . . at least for now. He is powerful and should be respected. He can teach you about greater summonings, summonings I feel you are prepared for. Go to him now. You can find him in Ratchet. . . above the port town next to the tower there. "
5452,The Binding,"Using the Runes of Summoning, summon and subdue a voidwalker, then return the Runes of Summoning to Carendin Halgar in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity. ","Surely you have seen the circle of summoning below us? Only there will you be able to draw forth an unbound voidwalker. Using these runes, you will be able to draw it forth, and then you must dominate it through strength of arms and magic. When it is subdued, it will be indentured to you. Come to me then, and I will elucidate the spell of summoning, so that it may serve you to whatever end you wish. "
5453,Cleansing of the Orb of Orahil,"Kill the Demon of the Orb, then speak with Tabetha. ","Ah, a summoner's orb--this is where the taint must be coming from. We must exorcise the demon within it if you're to use it. That I can do easily. You're the one who has the hard job.  You must kill the demon once I release it. And you'll have to be quick.  If you take too long then he'll return to the orb and we'll have to start over! So get yourself ready, <name>.  Prepare your strongest spells and keep your potions handy, and go get a friend if you have one.  Because this isn't going to be pretty. "
5454,Fine Gold Thread,"Here you go, &lt; name&gt; . ","Here you go, <name>. And please tell Menara we say hello. We expect great things of you. Perhaps when the Legion falls to its knees, your name will be spoken aloud and in praise of your power. I can't wait! "
5455,Tainted Memorandum,Read the Tainted Memorandum and speak to Alamar Grimm inside Anvilmar above Coldridge Valley. ,"While you were helping me out, this memorandum was given to me to pass on to you. Take some time to read it when you have a chance. I'm thinkin' it came from the warlock trainer Alamar. Take a gander at it and go find him inside Anvilmar when you've a chance. And watch yerself, <name>, your kind ain't too trusted 'round these parts. "
5456,In Search of Menara Voidrender,Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"<class>! Yes, you! You don't have all the accoutrements, but it's plain to see you're ready--the air around you exudes greater confidence. Yes, I see it now. Menara Voidrender would teach you a few things if you feel you're ready. She spends her time tutoring younger students in the arcane. She even gives gifts to those who pass her tests. Go to Ratchet in the Barrens if you're interested. She's above the city in Strahad's tower. "
5457,Summon Felsteed,Speak to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet. ,"Ah, good, you're here. I sent a <succubus/infernal> after you to get your attention, but it seems you were able to get here before it found you. No matter. There has been some talk lately of your growing power--that is good for you, possibly bad for others. But those are irrelevant points. The point is, I feel you've proven yourself and therefore are deserving of. . . hehe. . . a blessing of sorts. Above Ratchet in the Barrens you'll find a man named Strahad. I believe you've crossed paths before. "
5458,Halgar's Summons,Speak with Carendin Halgar in the Undercity. ,"Ah, <name>! I just received word from Carendin Halgar that he would like to see you for further training. You should be proud of yourself, <name>. It's not every day that Master Halgar personally sees fit to instruct a young warlock. You'll be able to find him in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity, near the Temple of the Damned. "
5459,The Prison's Casing,Travel to Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring and recover 5 Tears of the Hederine from the Hederine demons that occupy the gorge. ,"The Hederine demons that occupy the foothills of Mount Hyjal secrete powerful fel poisons, which if left to mature, harden into a dense anti-magic crystal. These crystals have come to be known as Tears of the Hederine. Not even the immense power of a Doomguard could break the walls of a prison constructed from this material. Travel to Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring and recover the Tears. "
5460,Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil,Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Still a fool, and still seeking the trappings of mortals. Yes, I speak to you with arrogance. I see you before me and I laugh. You're pathetic! But it matters not what I think. It only matters what those willing to deal with you thinks!  And in this case, against my better judgment, those with some portion of power feel you deserve more. If this is something you strive for then you should speak with Menara Voidrender in the tower above Ratchet. I believe you have met her before some time ago. "
5461,In Search of Menara Voidrender,Speak with Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. ,"Let us be clear about one thing, <name>: I don't feel you are ready for such responsibilities. I don't think aiding in the creation of any item of power is something a novice should ever be involved in; especially one so untested. But that's not my decision. The powers that be, or at least the ones that do wish to impart such gifts upon you get to decide that. If you're interested in learning more, I suggest you seek out Menara Voidrender in Ratchet. She usually resides in the tower above the port town. "
5462,Tainted Parchment,Read the Tainted Parchment and speak to Nartok inside the Den in the Valley of Trials. ,"Ah, while you were gone a parchment came for you, <name>. I usually avoid dealing with warlocks if I can help it, but I think you should read it when you have time. If I'm not mistaken, it came from your newly-appointed trainer Nartok. He would have words with you when you're ready. "
5463,Return to Talionia,Speak with Talionia in Silvermoon City. ,"One of your masters, Talionia, in Silvermoon City has sent a summons for you, <name>.  I'm certain it is time you learned to summon and control a more powerful demon, so I suggest you see her at once.  I understand Talionia is found in The Sanctum, a cozy little den of evil found along Murder Row. "
5464,Vile Familiars,Speak with Zureetha Fargaze. ,"Zureetha has been sending novices like yourself to help cull the numbers of the creatures in the cave near where you fought the vile familiars. I think it would be good for you to gain experience by assisting her. Be sure to tell her that you assisted with the imp problem, she'll probably have a reward for you. "
5465,Tainted Letter,Read the Tainted Letter and speak to Drusilla La Salle next to Northshire Abbey. ,"I was asked to bring this to your attention as soon as you returned from the kobold camps, <name>. It appears to be a letter sealed with the insignia of Drusilla, one of our local trainers. I wouldn't hesitate to read it before you go about any other business here in the Abbey. "
5466,The Summoning,Bring the Whirlwind Heart to Bath'rah Windwatcher. ,"I am ready to perform the ritual to summon Cyclonian.  When he is summoned, you must defeat him and take his whirlwind heart.  This I will use to instill a weapon with Cyclonian's power. <name>, are you ready to face the wind lord? "
5467,The Windwatcher,Speak with Bath'rah the Windwatcher. ,"Now that you've learned your berserker's stance, you'll want a nice weapon to use it with. Talk to Bath'rah the Windwatcher, a troll hermit who lives between the Alterac Mountains and the Western Plaguelands.  He is a skilled weapon maker and a powerful shaman. To find Bath'rah, go to the river that flows along Tarren Mill's eastern flank.  Follow it north--Bath'rah is camped near ruins that rest along the river's eastern bank. "
5468,The Islander,Speak with Klannoc Macleod. ,"Your renown as a warrior grows, <name>.  Now it is time to pit yourself against your peers and see where you stand. There is an island off the coast of the Barrens, south of Ratchet.  It is called Fray Island and it is a place where warriors meet. Meet, and fight. Speak with the chief warrior of Fray Island, Klannoc Macleod.  If he finds you worthy, then Klannoc will lead you further down the warrior's path. To reach Fray Island, search for the sand bar shallows along the Merchant Coast. "
5469,Voodoo Feathers,Bring the Voodoo Feathers from the trolls in the Sunken Temple to the Fallen Hero of the Horde. ,"Your honor has brought some peace to me.  It is only right that I offer you something in return. My weapons and armor were splendid in life, and yet they are of no use to me now.  They would be better served in your possession. Travel to the sunken temple and destroy the troll guardians Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro.  They carry magic feathers that can reform my physical body long enough to grant you a reward. "
5470,Essence of the Exile,The cauldron bubbles. ,The charms sink slowly into the cauldron's depths. . . A large bubble rises to the surface of the liquid and breaks. . . . . . And a churning lump of molten rock is revealed.

5472,A Troubled Spirit,Speak with the Fallen Hero of the Horde at the entrance to the Blasted Lands. ,"In the Blasted Lands, there is a troubled spirit who was once a great hero of the horde.  A warrior's honor does not die with the body, and it would serve you well to speak with him. "
5473,Orm Stonehoof and the Brutal Helm,Speak with Orm Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff. ,"Orm Stonehoof is respected greatly for his skill.  He will make for you the brutal helm. Seek him out in Thunder Bluff, near the pool by the city's great, central totem. "
5474,The Rethban Gauntlet,"Enter the Rethban Caverns, reach the first fork, and return to Yorus Barleybrew within the time allowed. ","I call my challenge the Rethban Gauntlet.  To pass the trial, all you must do is enter the Rethban Caverns, to the first fork, then return here.  Easy!  Except there are a few wrinkles. . . You have to return within an hour. There are whole heaps of Redridge Gnolls in the way. Before you start, you have to take a swig of my family's signature drink: Barleybrew Scalder! So what do you say?  The Rethban Caverns are in the foothills north of Lakeshire.  Are you ready to run the Rethban Gauntlet? "
5475,The Affray,"Kill Big Will, then speak to Klannoc Macleod on Fray Island. ","If you want to learn from me, then you must first pass The Affray.  It is a challenge we on Fray Island like to offer rising warriors who think they're tough, and if you can pass this test then I'll know you are. To begin, walk into the middle of that crowd yonder and step on the grate.  That'll tell Twiggy Flathead you're ready, and he'll send challengers against you. Beat all the challengers and he'll call out Big Will.  Kill Big Will, and return to me in the time we allow. "
5476,Ula'elek and the Brutal Gauntlets,Speak with Ula'elek in Durotar. ,"The troll smith Ula'elek will craft for you the brutal gauntlets.  He dwells in Durotar, in Sen'jin Village with his Darkspear brethren, and he awaits your coming. "

5478,Speak with Ruga,Speak with Ruga Ragetotem. ,"You are a warrior of skill and growing renown.  Perhaps you are ready for Ruga Ragetotem 's trial?  If so, then find Ruga in Camp Taurajo in the Barrens. He awaits those warriors who answer his call. "
5479,Forged Steel,Bring the Forged Steel Bars to Thun'grim Firegaze in the Barrens. ,"I will give you a weapon, <name>, but first you must aid me.  The Razormanes to the northwest came into my camp a few nights past.  They would not meet me in combat, but they know my eyes are bad--a few distracted me with snorts while others stole from me!  The cowards! They took an iron chest, and within it were some forged steel bars.  If you can recover them then I will give you the weapon you seek. Search for the iron box within the quilboar camps, and return with the forged steel bars. "
5480,Path of Defense,Bring 5 Singed Scales to Uzzek at Far Watch Post in the Barrens. ,"As a warrior, one of our most crucial tasks is. . . protection.  We are the shield of the Horde, and we keep our weaker brethren safe.  If you are to join in our ranks, then you must prove your mettle to me. Go to Thunder Ridge in Durotar, where live the lightning hides and thunder lizards.  Hunt the beasts!  Show me you are tougher than they!  Brave their assaults and bring me a stack of their singed scales as proof. Do this, and then I will teach you. "

5482,War on the Shadowsworn,Slaughter the Shadowsworn in the Blasted Lands and return to the Fallen Hero of the Horde. ,The continued presence of the shadowsworn in the Blasted Lands bring great pain to me.

5484,Velora Nitely and the Brutal Legguards,Speak with Velora Nitely in the Undercity. ,"It is said that, before her death, Velora Nitely was one of the finest armorsmiths in Lordaeron.

5485,The Shieldsmith,Bring the Cask of Scalder to Furen Longbeard. ,"You really showed what you were made of when you ran the Rethban Gauntlet, <name>.  And I'm true to my word.  I'll get you the reward I promised. . . Except it's in Stormwind. Talk to my friend, Furen Longbeard, in the Dwarven District of Stormwind.

5486,Veteran Uzzek,Speak with Uzzek at Far Watch Post in the Barrens. ,"The Horde honors its warriors because their strength is unquestioned.  But the truly great warriors are great students as well. Seek out Uzzek.  He is a veteran of many battles and now instructs young warriors in the ways of combat.  You will find him south of Far Watch Post, the orc garrison on the border of the Barrens and Durotar. "

Even as others seem to pass you by in ability, your knowledge of the world will be more valuable. Go to the Monastery in the north of Tirisfal Glades. In the library there, a book called Beginnings of the Undead Threat resides. It was used by the now-corrupt paladins there to train them to fight my kind. Bring it to me. "
5559,Red Silk Bandanas,Scout Riell at the Sentinel Hill Tower wants you to bring her 10 Red Silk Bandanas. ,"It's no secret that the trademark of the Defias Gang is their Red Bandanas.  But we've learned that the material from which these bandanas are made signifies the member's rank. That being said, I want you to eliminate as many high ranking Defias members as you can.  The highest ranking members will undoubtedly be found in VanCleef's secret hideout.  When you're done bring me 10 Red Silk Bandanas as proof of their deaths and I will reward you.  Good luck, <name>. "
5560,Hidden Enemies,Kill Bazzalan and Jergosh the Invoker before returning to Thrall in Orgrimmar. ,"Hmm, leaders of the Searing Blade. . . this concerns me most. If they are the ones of value to Neeru, then those are who we must target first. This satyr. . . Bazzalan, and the other Neeru mentioned--what was he, a warlock? --must be slain. Return to the Cleft of Shadow and enter Ragefire Chasm, <name>. Find these two leaders of the Searing Blade, and kill them. But be careful not to let Neeru know it was you who did this. You must retain your identity as one of his <brothers/sisters> in arms. "
5561,Wrath of the Lich King,Find Lady Jaina Proudmoore and escape the Halls of Reflection. ,"Uther knew a great deal about how Arthas might be defeated. It's hard to believe that there is much hope of defeating Arthas upon the steps of his own throne. And who will take up the crown of Lich King if it comes to that? Many questions remain, but the answers that you've uncovered may be critical to ensuring Arthas' defeat. You need to find Jaina and escape the Lich King while there's still time. "
5562,The Path to the Citadel,Free 15 Horde Slaves and kill Forgemaster Garfrost. ,"They've put our captured soldiers to work in the quarry. Kill their captors and set them free, <class>, and do it quickly. We will need their aid when we confront Scourgelord Tyrannus. "
5563,Echoes of Tortured Souls,Kill Bronjahm and the Devourer of Souls to secure access to the Pit of Saron. ,"I'm glad we have someone capable to aid us in this. Delving into the citadel with so few is risky at best, but opportunities like this are too rare to pass up. I'm awaiting the arrival of champions from the coliseum, but if your reputation holds true, you should be more than equipped to fight through the forge yourself. Clear the way to the far side and secure the passage to the Pit of Saron. We will need to hold it to move our men further into the Citadel. Be quick about it, <name>. Time is short. "
5564,Whatever it Takes! ,King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to enter the Halls of Lightning and defeat Loken. ,"One way or another, Loken shall fall. If I have to rip him limb from limb myself, he soon shall pay for his wretched deeds. Should you meet with him before I do, the honor and glory of his defeat shall be yours. Return to me with his lying tongue, and earn my blessing and gratitude. "
5565,The Pit of Saron,Meet Lady Jaina Proudmoore just inside the Pit of Saron. ,"Quickly, through the portal! I'll meet you on the other side. "
5566,Containment,Warden Alturas wants you to enter the Violet Hold and put and end to the blue dragon invasion force. ,"Here is the prison key. My men and I will stay here as a last line of defense in the event that you are unable to overcome the assault. Be sure to speak with Lieutenant Sinclari. She'll provide you with access to the prison's defenses. Hurry, <race>. There is little time. The few I left inside won't last long without your help. Report back to me once the invasion forces have been successfully dealt with. "
5567,Searching for the Lost Satchel,Search Ragefire Chasm for Maur Grimtotem's corpse and search it for any items of interest. ,"The troggs are not the only thing that interested Magatha in Ragefire Chasm. She has heard word that one of her servants, a Maur Grimtotem, found something peculiar while in the Chasm, but he never made it out to show her what. She'd like Maur's body found--if it still exists--and any signs of what he found while attempting to speak to the troggs. Return to Magatha any items of interest, and I'm sure she would be very generous in her reward. Again, seek the Chasm in the darkest areas of Orgrimmar. "
5568,Compendium of the Fallen,Retrieve the Compendium of the Fallen from the Monastery in Tirisfal Glades and return to Sage Truthseeker in Thunder Bluff. ,"The Earthen Ring had pure intentions towards our plagued brethren. But who is to know the motivations of those whispering in the ears of the Elder Council? The Forsaken whom we have allied with have a history wrought with deceit. Too hasty was our pact. Perhaps Cairne would have been wise to heed the warnings from Orgrimmar. Deep within the Scarlet Monastery lies the Compendium of the Fallen, guarded by crazed human zealots. Their method is forged from insanity but their research might prove useful. "
5569,Find the Gems,"Find the ruby, sapphire, and topaz that are scattered throughout Uldaman. ","The paladin's journal has provided perhaps the only clues that Uldaman will yield as to the location of the necklace's gems.  If the paladin's scribing remains accurate, then the Shadowforge dwarves and the troggs that vie for control of the dig site will need to be dealt with. Armed with this knowledge, the search for the gems begins in earnest.  When all the gems have been acquired, Talvash in Ironforge should be notified via the Phial of Scrying as per his instructions. "
5570,Rig Wars,Retrieve the Rig Blueprints and Thermaplugg's Safe Combination from Gnomeregan and bring them to Nogg in Orgrimmar. ,"Gnome technology - two years ago its most common use was as a punch line. Times certainly have changed. Now they've got a new rig built that's better than all our shredder models combined. I need the blueprints, <name>! Unfortunately, the plans are locked away in a safe near Mekgineer Thermaplugg. To make matters worse, the combination to the safe is only known by Mekgineer Thermaplugg. Do whatever you have to do to get that combination, <name>. Then crack open that safe and bring back those blueprints! "
5571,Deliverance from the Pit,Kill Scourgelord Tyrannus. ,"We need to make our way up the main path and through the cave to Tyrannus' rise. There, he will be forced to confront us there lest we make our way into the citadel proper. Go now, <class>. My men and I will be there to stand by you when the confrontation with Tyrannus comes. "
5572,Bring the End,Andrew Brownell wants you to kill Amnennar the Coldbringer and return his skull. ,"In the Barrens lies a horrid mess of tangled vines called Razorfen Downs. While our first observations of this place revealed little threat, our recent findings are much more serious. . . The quilboar of Razorfen Downs have aligned themselves with the Scourge. A Lich named Amnennar the Coldbringer rules them now, using the power of his massive consciousness to control their every move. Amnennar has a direct telepathic link to Ner'zhul; we must sever this bond, <name>. An end must come to the Coldbringer. "
5573,The Glowing Shard,Travel to Ratchet to find the meaning behind the Nightmare Shard. ,"The shard is a brilliant green, and although solid, what looks like smoke swirls just below the surface. You can't help staring into the depths of the crystal; at the same time, you know there is something very disturbing about it. Maybe you should see if anyone in Ratchet can tell you more about this strange shard. "
5574,The Fury Runs Deep,Motley Garmason wants Kam Deepfury's head brought to him at Dun Modr. ,"You have proven your loyalty to King Magni, <class>.  And your hatred for the Dark Iron scum is as great as my own. There is a task I wish to complete myself but I am bound by honor to stay with Longbraid.  But Roggo has gathered intelligence that proves Kam Deepfury was a conspirator in the attack on the Thandol Span.  It was by Deepfury's planning that Longbraid lost his kin. Deepfury is being held for political reasons in the Stormwind Stockade.  I want him dead, <name>.  For Longbraid!  Bring me his head! "
5575,The Book of Ur,Bring the Book of Ur to Keeper Bel'dugur at the Apothecarium in the Undercity. ,"<name>, Shadowfang Keep holds a book, the Book of Ur, which would be much prized in my collection.  Ur was a great mage of Dalaran before the coming of the Scourge, his studies in other worlds are of much value to. . . certain parties among the Forsaken. Enter Shadowfang Keep and find the book.  Bring it to me, and I will report your service to our Dark Lady. . . "
5576,Grime-Encrusted Ring,Figure out a way to remove the grime from the Grime-Encrusted Ring. ,"You have uncovered what appears to be a ring from the corpse of one of the Dark Iron dwarves.  It is difficult to tell what kind of ring it is, however; dirt and hardened residue cake the item completely, making wearing it impossible.  You think you can make out the slight luster of precious metal and maybe even the glint of a gem under the residue. If you are going to make use of this ring, you are going to need to find something to get the hardened residue off of it. "
5577,Frostmourne,Meet Lady Jaina Proudmoore at the entrance to the Halls of Reflection. ,"We must press on, hero. We've come so far. . . we're so close to our goal. I must delay a moment to send Elandra back to the airship. I'm uncertain how we're going to escape with so many men lost and so few to keep our path in secure - we will need any help they can send. Continue on. I will meet you in the Halls of Reflection. "
5578,The Path to the Citadel,Free 15 Alliance Slaves and kill Forgemaster Garfrost. ,"They've put our captured soldiers to work in the quarry! Kill their captors and set them free, hero, and do it quickly. We will need their aid when we confront Scourgelord Tyrannus. "
5579,Discretion is Key,Rhonin wants you to go to the Violet Hold in Dalaran and speak with Warden Alturas. ,"Listen to me, <race>. It's just been brought to my attention that there's been an incident at the Violet Hold. It would appear that the blues are launching a full scale invasion of Dalaran! I need you to get to the prison and speak with Warden Alturas at once. He'll give you the details. That is not all. I need this handled with utmost discretion. We mustn't alarm the citizens of Dalaran if it can possibly be avoided. Do I make myself clear? Very well. Now, go! "
5580,The Struggle Persists,Raelorasz wants you to enter the Oculus and rescue Belgaristrasz  and his companions. ,"The battle goes on, <name>. Somehow we have managed to avoid detection and continue our attempts to frustrate Malygos' schemes. This, though, is where the good news ends and the bad begins. Our best efforts have had little or no effect. Malygos and his underlings grow stronger in power with each passing day. And now, our latest assault team has been captured and is being held in the Oculus. We must attempt a rescue! Belgaristrasz and his companions are invaluable to our cause. Can we count on you, <name>? "
5581,Have They No Shame? ,Librarian Serrah wants you to enter the Nexus and recover Berinand's Research. ,"Archmage Berinand is the Kirin Tor's foremost authority on Malygos. He's spent his life studying the aspect and his behaviors. Recently, he loaned me his research on the Arcanomicron, some sort of map that Malygos is trying to assemble. I made the mistake of discussing it with a group of Horde adventurers while they were restocking their goods here - and now it's gone! It must have been them, <class>. Please, follow them into the nexus and recover the book before Berinand comes to recover it. "
5582,The Gordok Ogre Suit,"Bring 4 Bolts of Runecloth, 8 Rugged Leather, 2 Rune Threads, and Ogre Tannin to Knot Thimblejack. ","If you're going to fight the king of this dump - and I think that's what you're bound to do - then you're going to need to get by Captain Kromcrush.  Now, you can get by him by killing him, sure.  You might actually want to leave him alive. How, you ask?  Since I've been here, I think I know how to make an ogre suit that will last just long enough to fool these bozos.  The only problem is stability - ten minutes tops.  Bring me what I need, and I'll make you one.  I'm not going anywhere. . . "
5583,Testing an Enemy's Strength,"Search Orgrimmar for Ragefire Chasm, then kill 8 Ragefire Troggs and 8 Ragefire Shaman before returning to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff. ","Beneath the city of Orgrimmar, stout creatures known as troggs started coming to the surface from deep below the lava filled tunnels. In her ever-benevolence, Magatha sought to make peace with the creatures, but they turned on her diplomats, killing them. She will not allow such treatment of the tauren people and now consider the creatures a threat to all of the Horde. She asks that you put an end to this trogg threat before it overwhelms the Horde from below. Find Ragefire Chasm and destroy them all. "
5584,For Posterity,Chronicler Bah'Kini at Dubra'Jin wants you to enter Gundrak and collect 6 Drakkari History Tablets. ,"Gundrak be doomed, mon. History be repeatin' itself before our eyes. When trolls be turnin' on their own gods, the end be certain. It just be a matter of time. Perhaps if we can record the events clearly, we might prevent future generations from traveling down da same path. If you be havin' the courage, enter Gundrak and search for clues to what brought the Drakkari Empire to such an end as dis. "
5585,Ingvar Must Die! ,"Dark Ranger Marrah has asked you to kill Ingvar the Plunderer in Utgarde Keep, then bring his head to High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing. ","Finally, someone's come. I've been here far too long and my wits are beginning to fail me. Of our entire recon party, only I remain. I shall give you my report and it will be up to you to act upon the information. Know this, <class>; it did not come cheaply. These vrykul are relentless fighters. Given their numbers and their savage tactics, our only hope is to bring down their leader and pray it brings chaos to their ranks. Ingvar is his name. Bring his head to Anselm when your duty is done. "
5586,Hearts of Zeal,Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity wants 20 Hearts of Zeal. ,"Why do I need a rare type of guano, you might ask. Well, for this experiment I want to see what effect two diametrically opposed chemical substances can have on each other, especially when both are combined with an ever-toxic agent to ensure the most. . . ghastly results. In the northeastern peaks of Tirisfal Glades lies the Scarlet Monastery. There the crazed disciples of the Scarlet Crusade congregate, both inside and outside the halls. Which you slay matters not, any of them may have the heart I need. "
5587,Into The Scarlet Monastery,"Kill High Inquisitor Whitemane, Scarlet Commander Mograine, Herod, the Scarlet Champion and Houndmaster Loksey and then report back to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity. ","One of my duties while I'm stationed here is to help the Forsaken take care of their borders, and that, <class>, is exactly what you're going to do for me. I might live and breathe, but the Scarlet Crusade will cut down my people as quickly as they will one of the undead. They're a problem here, a big one, and you're going to do something about it. Go to the Monastery and slay High Inquisitor Whitemane and her lieutenants. "
5588,Gahz'rilla,Bring Gahz'rilla's Electrified Scale to Wizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats. ,"Deep in Zul'Farrak, the sand troll city in Tanaris, there is a sacred pool.  From that pool the trolls summon a huge beast!  Gahz'rilla!  He's so fierce that even his scales crackle with energy.  It's that energy I want to harness for my car! Bring me the electrified scale of Gahz'rilla! But the summoning of Gahz'rilla is a well-kept secret of the trolls.  To face him, you must first wrest the secret from them. "
5589,The God Hakkar,Bring the Filled Egg of Hakkar to Yeh'kinya in Tanaris. ,"Now it is time to capture the essence of the avatar of Hakkar. Take the Egg of Hakkar to the Sanctum of the Fallen God in the Sunken Temple in Azeroth.  Invoke the egg's power to stir the dead god. He will send his minions against you.  Defeat his bloodrinkers and take their Hakkari blood, then use the blood to dowse the eternal flames that hold Hakkar's spirit.  When all the flames go out, the avatar of Hakkar will enter our world. Defeat him, and place his essence within the Egg of Hakkar. "
5590,Returning the Lost Satchel,Take the Grimtotem Satchel to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff. ,"You find a satchel under the body of the tauren. It is still gripped tightly in his arms as though he was trying to protect it while being attacked by the troggs. Removing the satchel from his vice-like grip, you stow it with your own equipment and prepare to make your way out of the tunnels and back to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff. "
5591,Secret of the Circle,Travel into the Sunken Temple and discover the secret hidden in the circle of statues. ,"My memories are cloudy, but I will tell you what I can. The circle of statues in the Sunken Temple, while dangerous, I believe that they hold the secret to unlock an even greater treasure. From the main altar, I was able to activate a series of lights. I think that if you can uncover what these lights mean, you might be able to unlock whatever secrets are hiding in this room. I warn you though, <name>. Great evil lies in the temple. It's likely that anything valuable will be fervently guarded. . . "
5592,Dispelling Illusions,"Chromie wants you to use the Arcane Disruptor on the suspicious crates in Stratholme Past, then speak to her near the entrance to Stratholme. ","Always meddling. . . The Infinite Dragonflight seek to disrupt history as we have come to know it by deceiving Prince Arthas. If they can convince him that none of the grain here carries the plague, then he'll never have to make the fateful decision to cull Stratholme. This must not come to pass. Use this Arcane Disruptor on any suspicious crates of grain you find to reveal them for what they are. Meet me near Stratholme's entrance, north of this place, when the work is done. "
5593,Quickening,Archmage Berinand in the Transitus Shield wants you to enter the Nexus and collect 5 Arcane Splinters from Crystalline Protectors. ,"Though we may be witnessing the end of our existence, I can't help but marvel. I've learned more in my short time here than in decades of studies. These Ancients are being exposed to incredible levels of arcane energy. It's literally transforming them into something. . . different. I'm confident that there's another stage in their metamorphosis. I'll need you to actually enter the Nexus, <name>, and find me some evidence of their final state. Do be careful. . . . "
5594,The Prophecy of Mosh'aru,Bring the First and Second Mosh'aru Tablets to Yeh'kinya in Tanaris. ,"The ancient prophecy of Mosh'aru speaks of a way to contain the god Hakkar's essence.  It was written on two tablets and taken to the troll city of Zul'Farrak, west of Gadgetzan. Bring me the Mosh'aru tablets! The first tablet is held by the long-dead troll Theka the Martyr.  It is said his persecutors were cursed into scarabs and now scuttle about his shrine. The second tablet is held by the hydromancer Velratha, near the sacred pool of Gahz'rilla. When you have the tablets, bring them to me. "
5595,A Royal Escort,Chromie has asked you to accompany Arthas in the Culling of Stratholme. ,"The Infinite Dragonflight are not likely to give up so easily. I cannot be certain of what they're up to, but something tells me we haven't seen the last of them today. In just a moment, Arthas will face a desperate dilemma, and make a momentous decision. Don't lose focus now, <name>. I needn't remind you how much is at stake. I must call upon you to accompany the prince in his culling of Stratholme. Arthas must make it through Stratholme alive and you must see to it that he defeats Mal'Ganis! "
5596,Smart Drinks,Bring 6 portions of Wailing Essence to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet. ,"Ok, so the raptor horns didn't work so well.  But that's all right -- no one got rich on their first try!  And besides, I think I found something that'll work even better in my smart drinks! There is a substance called Wailing Essence, and I think it is the cause of the strange plants and animals in the Barrens.  Get me some and I'll try it in my drink! I heard the essence gathers in ectoplasmic creatures in the Wailing Caverns to the west.  Hunt those creatures and gather the essence. "
5597,A Score to Settle,High Executor Anselm wants you to to go into Utgarde and slay Prince Keleseth. ,"This elf prince thinks he can come to my town, insult my queen, kill my men and get away with it?  He thinks we're going to stand by while the hordes of Utgarde build up to launch an attack? Not in a million years. You're going to walk right into Utgarde and kill him in front of any of these vrykul gorillas that might be watching.  I want Arthas to know that we've arrived and we're playing for keeps. "
5598,Blackfathom Villainy,Bring the head of Twilight Lord Kelris to Dawnwatcher Selgorm in Darnassus. ,"Strength has left me. Your help is needed! Long ago this site was a great temple of Elune. But misfortune led to ruin when the corruption of an Old God seeped up from beneath the earth and tainted the sacred Moon Well. Aku'Mai, servant of the Old God, rose from the waters. The Twilight's Hammer cultists have allied with the naga to occupy these grounds. The cultists, led by Kelris, sacrifice innocents to Aku'Mai for power. Slay Kelris and bring his head to Selgorm in Darnassus, <name>, please. "
5599,Mythology of the Titans,Retrieve Mythology of the Titans from the Monastery and bring it to Librarian Mae Paledust in Ironforge. ,"The future is inevitable! We hurl ourselves towards it like falling raindrops to the Great Sea. But perhaps, by studying the past, we can know what to expect and be better prepared for the unknown. Before dire troubles fell upon Lordaeron, there was a bastion of knowledge tucked away in the Tirisfal Glades. It is rumored that a book called Mythology of the Titans was housed in the library of the old Monastery. Bring it to me and perhaps together we can unlock the secrets of the past! "
5600,Halls of Stone,Brann Bronzebeard wants you to accompany him as he uncovers the secrets that lie in the Halls of Stone. ,"Well now, I'm surprised to see other adventurers in a place such as this! It so happens that I could use a bit o' company for what lies ahead. If my research on these halls is accurate, there be monumental discoveries to be made here!

5601,In Search of Thaelrid,Seek out Argent Guard Thaelrid in Blackfathom Deeps. ,"Many rumors circulate these days about the union of the Twilight's Hammer and the naga in Blackfathom Deeps on the coasts of Ashenvale. My role here with the Argent Dawn is to collect as much information as I can, so we know when and where help is needed. It has been weeks now since I sent a scout to check on the activity at Blackfathom Deeps. Argent Guard Thaelrid has not yet reported back. My other scouts are preoccupied with pressing matters. Seek out and aid Thaelrid for me, <name>. "
5602,Echoes of Tortured Souls,Kill Bronjahm and the Devourer of Souls to secure access to the Pit of Saron. ,"I cannot thank you enough for coming. We're severely undermanned to be risking a venture into the citadel, but opportunities like this are too rare to pass up. I'm awaiting the arrival of champions from the coliseum, but if your reputation holds true, you should be more than equipped to fight through the forge yourself. Clear the way to the far side and secure the passage to the Pit of Saron. We will need to hold it to move our men further into the citadel. Please hurry, <name>. We're counting on you. "
5603,Diametrically Opposed,King Jokkum at Dun Niffelem wants you to enter the Halls of Lightning and defeat Volkhan. ,"I shall speak plainly to you, little <race>. My people have not been the same since our ties with Thorim were severed. As their leader, I wish nothing more than for their hearts to be mended and our friendship with the Stormlord to be renewed. In your defeat of Fjorn, a step has been taken down that path. I would have you bring us a step further. . . In the Halls of Lightning, one even greater than Fjorn sits in opposition to our existence. Volkhan will not rest until either he, or we, are no more. "
5604,Deathstalkers in Shadowfang,Find the Deathstalker Adamant and Deathstalker Vincent. ,"In preparation for an assault on Shadowfang, two deathstalkers were sent to the keep to gather intelligence.  It has been many days and they have not returned, but we must receive their report if we're to have any hope of a successful attack! So here is your task, <name>.  Go to Shadowfang Keep to the south and find the Deathstalkers Adamant and Vincent.  Find them, and if they require aid then give it. This mission is as dangerous as is it critical, <name>.  Do not fail. "
5605,The Shattered Necklace,Search for the original creator of the shattered necklace to learn of its potential value. ,"You have found a tarnished necklace, though the tarnish belies intricate and magical craftsmanship.  The necklace has been shattered, as its setting appears to be missing three gems.  On the underside of the necklace is the faint imprint of the city seal for Ironforge.  Below the seal are three tiny, engraved letters: ""TdK"". If there is anything to be gleaned from the necklace, you will need to learn about its origins.  Perhaps the seal and the initials are a start. . . "
5606,Deviate Eradication,"Ebru in the Wailing Caverns wants you to kill 7 Deviate Ravagers, 7 Deviate Vipers, 7 Deviate Shamblers and 7 Deviate Dreadfangs. ","Naralex had a noble goal. Our great leader aspired to enter the Emerald Dream and help regrow these harsh lands back into the lush forest it once was. But something went terribly wrong. Naralex's dream turned into a nightmare and corrupt creatures began to inhabit the caverns. While some Disciples of Naralex seek to awake our master, my concern is with ridding these caves of the evil beasts. Brave the caverns, <name>, and eradicate the deviate spawn. "
5607,Tiara of the Deep,Bring the Tiara of the Deep to Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"Long ago I possessed a beautiful piece of jewelry, the Tiara of the Deep.  And not only was it pretty--it held great power for those with the knowledge to use it. So when word of the tiara reached the Hydromancer Velratha, she had to have it.  She sent agents to my home and they stole it while I was away.  The thieves! I want my tiara back!  Go to Zul'Farrak, the troll city in Tanaris, find Velratha and wrench the tiara from her.  Return it to me and you'll earn my favor. "
5608,Deviate Hides,Nalpak in the Wailing Caverns wants 20 Deviate Hides. ,"As Naralex descended deeper into his nightmare, a strange breed of beasts arose from beneath the Barrens into the Wailing Caverns. These deviate creatures have strange, otherworldly properties. While evil in nature, it is my opinion that some good can come from their existence here in Kalimdor. I believe their hides will be of particular use in the ways of leatherworking. If you feel up to the task, venture into the caves below and retrieve some deviate hides. "
5609,The Faceless Ones,Kilix the Unraveler in the Pit of Narjun wants you to kill Herald Volazj and the three Forgotten Ones that accompany him in Ahn'Kahet. ,"In my peoples' struggle against the forces of the undead, they dug deeper as they lost ground. In desperation, they dug too deep. We inadvertently exposed a tendril of the old god's will, which was made manifest in the creatures known only as the Faceless. In the end, we could not fight on two fronts against such powerful enemies. Our misfortune cost us the war against the undead, and ultimately, our home. Enter Ahn'kahet, <class>, and cleanse our former home of these Faceless atrocities. "
5610,Blueleaf Tubers,Grab a Crate with Holes. ,"Blueleaf tubers are a delicacy around the world!  But they're rare, very rare.  The only place to find them is here in the Barrens, deep in the earth, in Razorfen Kraul. And even then, they're impossible to find unless you know just where to look!  That's why I've trained these snufflenose gophers to find them for me.  They have great noses and can smell a tuber from fifty paces away. It won't be easy, but if you get me some tubers I'll pay you handsomely. "
5611,Reclaimed Treasures,"Get Krom Stoutarm's treasured possession from his chest in the North Common Hall of Uldaman, and bring it to him in Ironforge. ","I had myself a fine job as a digger at the Uldaman excavation site in the Badlands. . . that is until those blasted troggs showed up.  I escaped with my hide barely intact, and nothing else.  In the chaos, I left my most treasured possession.  It's safe from the troggs in my chest, sure, but it's right in the thick of 'em. I'd be in your debt, both in honor and coin, if you could fetch it for me!  A chest with my name on it is at the end of the North Common Hall.  That's the one you need to get in. "
5612,Vyletongue Corruption,Fill the Coated Cerulean Vial at the orange crystal pool in Maraudon. ,"A satyr known as Vyletongue has corrupted the caverns of Maraudon, stunting the growth of many of the plants inside. Take this vial, <name>. Fill it at the corrupted orange pool found inside the caverns; the coating inside the vial will counter the toxins, turning it into a healing agent. Find the Vylestem vines inside the orange caverns, and use the purified liquid on them. The corruption will be purged from the plant, but do know that Vyletongue will still control it. He may use it against you. . . "
5613,The Crone of the Kraul,Bring Razorflank's Medallion to Falfindel Waywarder in Thalanaar. ,"Poor Heralath! And this dwarf. . . Lonebrow. What a brave soul he was.

It's designed to project a burst of cold energy at the egg of a black dragon. . . and freeze it solid!  Can you test it for me? I heard that high up in Blackrock Spire, the dragons have a rookery where they hatch their eggs.  That's where you'll have to go to test the eggscilloscope, and then let me know how it worked!

5858,Extinguishing the Idol,Escort Belnistrasz to the Quilboar's idol in Razorfen Downs. ,"Near the entrance is an idol that functions as a macabre oven for the Quilboar; the beasts. . . they literally consume their abductees from the Barrens.  I can shut down the idol and bind them from using it again, but I need your aid in doing so.  My plan: escort me to the idol.  Once we arrive, I'll commence the ritual.  I'll barely be able to communicate with you, let alone defend myself.  Protect me while I shut down the idol.  If they take me down, then it's all over for us. Are you with me? ! "
5859,An Unholy Alliance,Take the Small Scroll to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity. ,"My Lady, You know very well what it is we are offering. The opportunity for you to take the Barrens and the lands beyond is a great one. We simply want your aid in return.

5861,Willix the Importer,Escort Willix the Importer to the exit of Razorfen Kraul. ,"At last, help has arrived! You have no clue how long I've been held prisoner here. I can't remember the last time I saw the outside of this place. You see, I am an entrepreneur. Always out for a copper, as they say. I caught wind that Mebok Mizzyrix was paying well for Blueleaf Tuber from this here pig pen. I figured it would be an easy in, easy out kind of affair. As you can see, I was a bit wrong! Anyway, if you'd be so kind as to help me get out of here, I'll make it worth your while. "
5862,A Vengeful Fate,Bring Razorflank's Heart to Auld Stonespire in Thunder Bluff. ,"Cairne is a noble leader for uniting our people here on Thunder Bluff.

5872,The Right Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet,Use the Brazier of Beckoning to summon forth the spirit of Kormok and slay him. ,"Now we have what we need, so it's time to discuss who it is that you'll be summoning next. Kormok was ok for an ogre, right up until he turned to necromancy. After that, things got creepy for just about everyone in the outfit. It was no surprise then when he took his piece of the amulet and returned to his new home, Scholomance. But even there, or perhaps especially there, he was not safe from the spectral assassins.

5880,The Restless Souls,Use Egan's Blaster on the ghostly and spectral citizens of Stratholme. ,"I draw my power - my will to continue living and breathing - from the unmitigated hatred I have for the Scourge and all that they have done. I am, however, no zealot. There are those, like the Scarlet Crusade, who would sooner destroy the innocent undead than lend them even an ounce of compassion. Which brings me to this: My blaster.

You must finish what I attempted to do, you must rescue Ysida from the clutches of the Baron! "
5887,Houses of the Holy,Houses of the Holy is a quest begun by Leonid Barthalomew the Revered in the Eastern Plaguelands. ,"I look at my undeath as a malady, <race>. An illness that merely requires treatment; however, it is also a great blessing for the Argent Dawn. What better vessel to smite the heathens of the Scourge than through the undead? I am revered by my colleagues because of the sacrifices I have made, but the accolades mean nothing to me. If you are interested in assisting the Argent Dawn, then a job I can offer. Venture to Stratholme and recover our surplus of holy water. Search the supply crates. "
5888,Ramstein,Travel to Stratholme and slay Ramstein the Gorger. ,"I was overwhelmed. On this very stead, I stood. . . held my ground in defense of Lordaeron.

5901,The Warlord's Hideout,Watcher Jhang wants you to find and slay Warlord Kalithresh inside Coilfang Reservoir. ,"There are benefits to hiding very, very quietly at the entrance of your enemy's hideout. Just hours ago I saw a group of naga go through the stone archway on the second tunnel from the left.  I'm not well versed in their language, yet I clearly understood one word: Kalithresh. That must be the entrance to the steam vaults, where Warlord Kalithresh has been commanding his troops from.  You must find him and stop him.  I am too weak to be of any assistance. "
5902,Orders from Lady Vashj,Deliver the Orders from Lady Vashj to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. ,"This letter contains detailed orders to the Coilfang naga operating the steam vaults.  It warns of the arrival of Cenarion druids into the region and orders them to be slain on sight.  The rate of water redirection from other lakes into Coilfang Reservoir is to be doubled.

5915,The Temple of Atal'Hakkar,Collect 20 Fetishes of Hakkar and bring them to Fel'Zerul in Stonard. ,"So he spoke of Jammal'an's prophecy? The Atal'ai spiritual leader believes once Hakkar returns to Azeroth from the Nether, the god will grant the Atal'ai tribe immortality. Foolish trickery to bring about a premature doomsday if you ask me. But you say the exile spoke of enchanted fetishes? This concerns me greatly. If these are in fact the key to the Atal'ai ritual which caused this mess, we must understand their intrinsic powers. Venture into the Temple, and seize the fetishes! "
5916,"Eranikus, Tyrant of the Dream",Travel to the continent of Teldrassil and find Malfurion's agent somewhere outside the walls of Darnassus. ,"This is a journey of redemption, hero. Would it be that I was slain today, I would have died for a just and righteous cause. You must recover the green scepter shard. You must cleanse Eranikus of the taint placed upon him by the Old Gods.

This agent will set things in motion for us and inform Tyrande of our plans without alerting Staghelm. <Malfurion sighs. >A fall from grace a thousand years in the making. . . "

5918,Bring Me A Shrubbery! ,Collect 5 Sanguine Hibiscus and return them to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh. ,"We must replenish our supply of sanguine hibiscus, which we use for a number of purposes.  They used to grow thick as shrubs, but the lowering of the marsh's water levels means that they can only be found now in the Underbog at Coilfang Reservoir, under Serpent Lake. It is said that the shamblers, bog giants, and underbats there consider them a delicacy.  So, if you are to help us, you must retrieve the flowers from them. "
5919,Bring Me Another Shrubbery! ,"We can still use more of the sanguine hibiscus from the shamblers, bog giants and underbats of the Underbog at Coilfang Reservoir. ","These will do nicely, but we can always use more.  Perhaps you will find yourself in the Underbog again soon? "
5920,"Oh, It's On! ","Oh, It's On! is a dungeon quest with objectives in The Underbog, given by T'shu in Sporeggar, Zangarmarsh. ","While we are a peaceful people, we are at war with the spore giants, whether we like it or not.  And there is a saying amongst us that all is fair in mushrooms and war! One of the leaders of the spore giants, Hungerfen, has been tending a very special plant, known as the Underspore, to perfection for millennia.  It would break his spirit if something were to happen to that plant. Travel to the Underbog in Coilfang Reservoir and steal a frond off of it for us.  Trust me, he'll notice. "
5921,Stalk the Stalker,Bring the Brain of the Black Stalker to Khn'nix at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh. ,"Historically the greatest danger to my people has been from the marsh walkers.  With the new problems we are facing from spore giants, we cannot afford another attack from our ancient enemies. You have proven yourself to be capable, <class>.  Do you think that you'd be able to journey to the Underbog in Coilfang Reservoir and eliminate the great mother of the marsh walkers, known as The Black Stalker? ! Bring me her brain as proof. "
5922,Solution to Doom,Bring the Tablet of Ryun'eh to Theldurin the Lost. ,"Oh my!  Oh my!  There is a doom approaching.  Mark me!  A doom! No, I cannot speak of it. . . cannot utter their names or they may hear me!  But if we learn, yes, if we learn more of them. . . then maybe we can learn how to foil them! Maybe. Go into Uldaman.  No!  I said it!  You must find. . . find the tablet of. . . Ryun'eh.  Yes, find it!  And don't make me speak that name again! It is deep in that place, in an ancient chest.  That's where it hides. . . in a chest crafted before the works of any dwarf. "
5923,Necklace Recovery,Look for a valuable necklace within the Uldaman dig site and bring it back to Dran Droffers in Orgrimmar. ,"We've got work for you, that is if you've got the guts to do it! Deep in the Badlands is the Uldaman dig site.  We've heard a tale about some idiot paladin who died there recently.  Why we even care is that he had a very valuable necklace on him.  It's supposedly got three large gems: a ruby, a sapphire, and a topaz. The shot: we want it, and we're payin' TOP SILVER to get it.  It may be damaged, but that's neither here nor there; we'll fix whatever scratches are on it. "
5924,Back to Uldaman,Search for clues as to the current disposition of Talvash's necklace within Uldaman. ,"A competitor of mine started a rumor that my necklace cursed the paladin.  Needless to say, no one wants to buy cursed items from a jeweler. <name>, I'll make you a deal - find the gems and I'll reassemble the necklace, so long as you'll advertise that I do NOT make cursed items! Try looking for clues in Uldaman; maybe see if the paladin's body is down there, since he's the one who we know had it last!  When you find the gems you should use this; it'll allow you to contact me here in Ironforge. "
5925,The Lost Tablets of Will,"Find the Tablet of Will, and return them to Advisor Belgrum in Ironforge. ","We've slowed the Shadowforge clan by cutting them off from Blackrock Spire, but Hammertoe's quest is still unfulfilled. His death must not be in vain. He dreamt of finding the Tablet of Will: a stone shard inscribed with magic by the titans themselves to help imbue their creations with life--making them have a will of their own, or so the legends say. We must still recover the Tablet before the Shadowforge clan finds it. Return to Uldaman, find the tablet, and return here immediately. "
5926,The Hidden Chamber,"Read Baelog's Journal, explore the hidden chamber, then report to Prospector Stormpike. ","Now for the task at hand. There is a secret chamber, the Chamber of Khaz'mul, that must be explored.  The problem is that the chamber's behind a huge, locked door!  It's a lucky thing I know how to open it. I've described everything in my journal, here on the table.  My band and I are stuck here for now. . . so you, <name>, must find the chamber of Khaz'mul for us! Read my journal, explore the chamber, then report to Prospector Stormpike at the Explorers' League in Ironforge. "
5927,Restoring the Necklace,"Obtain a power source from the most powerful construct you can find in Uldaman, and deliver it to Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge. ","You are going to need to find some ""oomph"" for the necklace, and Uldaman is probably the best place for it, actually.  I guess there are a lot of constructs running around in there, yeah?  Well, take out the biggest, baddest construct in that place and grab its power source!  I am pretty sure I can fuse that source into the necklace. Without that power source, fixing the necklace will be impossible.  Come back to me here to Ironforge when you have it, and we'll get it all fixed up for you! "
5928,Reclaimed Treasures,"Get Patrick Garrett's family treasure from their family chest in the South Common Hall of Uldaman, and bring it to him in the Undercity. ","Sweeping the bat pens with this broom is not befitting a Garrett!  I've earned a little coin from this accursed job, and I'm willing to spend it on you to better my station. The Garrett family weapon of choice is locked away in our chest in the South Common Hall of Uldaman from when we Garretts toiled there as diggers.  Without it, I will be stuck here forever - literally - sweeping up after these infernal bats. Reclaim my family's treasure and bring it to me!  Help me restore my birthright! "
5929,The Platinum Discs,Speak with stone watcher and learn what ancient lore it keeps. ,"The centerpieces of this treasure chamber are four huge platinum discs, each adorned with numerous sigils of an unknown origin.  Touching them makes your hand tingle.  Just after touching the discs, the visage of a large stone watcher springs forth. ""Salutations.  I am a keeper of knowledge.  The Creators' synthesis of the Earthen has been chronicled and stored here for this world in the Discs of Norgannon. ""You have uncovered a wealth of previously undiscovered worldly lore! "
5930,Agmond's Fate,Bring 4 Carved Stone Urns to Prospector Ironband in Loch Modan. ,"The last report I received from Agmond is troubling, more so now that he's dead!  He mentioned that his diggers uncovered ""ancient urns"" at the dig site outside Uldaman.  I fear that the urns he found at that site incited the troggs, just as did the idols I found here. I need you to get those urns for our studies.  Go to the Uldaman site, gather the urns, then return to me. "
5931,The Lost Dwarves,Find Baelog in Uldaman. ,"The dig site at Uldaman wasn't always overrun.  We Ironforge dwarves used to control the area, but. . . that was before the troggs came.  They came so fast and in such numbers that not even dwarven might could stop them! In fact, their attack was so sudden that I fear some of our people may be trapped behind enemy lines. My friend Baelog led a small band of dwarves deep within the site just before the troggs showed up.  If he and his company live, then I want you to find them. "
5932,Power Stones,Bring 8 Dentrium Power Stones and 8 An'Alleum Power Stones to Rigglefuzz in the Badlands. ,"A while ago, I had an incident with the Shadowforge Dwarves.  They brought me to Angor Fortress to study two types of strange stones from Uldaman.  I discovered that the stones were sustained, stable power sources if treated correctly.  It's amazing the things one can find in that old dig site! Anyway, after I told them the secret of the stones they kicked me out of Angor Fortress and began digging for more in Uldaman. I want those stones for myself!  Bring me both types and I'll pay you plenty! "
5933,Find the Gems and Power Source,"Recover all three gems and a power source for the necklace from Uldaman, and then bring them to Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath. ","Here is the journal, translated for you to read on your own.  The crux of it says dwarves hid the ruby, the troggs hid the topaz, and a trogg named Grimlok has the sapphire. Look - you're going to need a power source to make the necklace work again.  Dran Droffers doesn't know this.  To find one, here's what I'd do: go as deep as you can in Uldaman and kill whatever construct there is the strongest.  No doubt whatever that is would have it. When you have everything collected, come back here! "
5934,Amulet of Secrets,Find Hammertoe's Amulet and return it to him in Uldaman. ,"Ye're brave. . . <cough>. . . to come into Uldaman fer me, <class>.

That amulet'll lead 'em. . . <cough>. . .  right to the scrolls if he ain't stopped. It's up to you, <name>. Please. . . get that amulet. The scrolls will surely help the Dark Irons create even more powerful golems. I just know it. I can feel it in me bones. "
5935,"Necklace Recovery, Take 2",Find a clue as to the gems' whereabouts in the depths of Uldaman. ,"As sure as Malton is a dummy, those gems are still in Uldaman somewhere.  You're going to have to go back there and look for them. Like I said before, if the information we have is correct then there's a ruby, a sapphire, and a topaz that go with the necklace.  Find them and put them in the necklace. As to where the gems are, who knows?  Maybe you'll get lucky and find the corpse of the Paladin.  If he's not been stripped clean already, then maybe he's got them on him still. "
5936,Lore for a Price,Bring five silver bars to Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge. ,"I am a jeweler of great renown here in Ironforge!  Well, former renown anyway. . . I have fallen onto hard times due to the chicanery of a competitor!  A bad reputation in this business spells financial disaster.  As a result, I find myself without a copper to my good-though-currently-sullied name. I want you to get me five silver bars to finish an order I received - the first in what seems like an eternity. You get me those five silver bars, and I'll answer your questions on the necklace. "
5937,Translating the Journal,Find someone who can translate the paladin's journal. ,"At an impasse of sorts, you know that you will need the book translated into a language you can understand.  There certainly are a number of people in the world who could do it; the closest location that might have someone who could, however, is the Kargath outpost in the Badlands.  Perhaps that is a good place to start. "
5938,Translating the Journal,Let Jarkal borrow the necklace. ,"Droffers and Son Salvage aren't smart enough to restore the magic in the necklace, but I am.  All I want to do is study the necklace so I can learn to make them myself.  To do that, I will need your necklace.  Let me borrow it, and in exchange for the time I get to study it I will translate the journal for you.  While you are searching for the gems, I should have enough time to learn what I need to.

5939,A Sign of Hope,Find Hammertoe Grez in Uldaman. ,"<name>, can ye find him? Can you find Hammertoe in Uldaman? If those dirty Shadowforge are holdin' him hostage to figure out what he knows about the titan excavations, then all of Ironforge could be in huge trouble. For a long time now those Dark Irons have been lookin' for magics to make more powerful golems. Hammertoe was doin' the same, of course, but only to stop them. They're probably keepin' him alive until they learn what he knows. Ye've got to hurry if you're gonna save him! "
5940,Deliver the Gems,Deliver the Necklace and Gem Salvage to Dran Droffers in Orgrimmar. ,"Any necklace setting and gem will work, so long as they are the same material.  This power source, however, is what will bring the magic back to the necklace. . . I hope. I'll gladly supply the gems needed for your version of the necklace, so long as the power source actually works. Head to Orgrimmar and keep your end of the bargain with Droffers and Son Salvage.

I've felt their edge personally, and there be somethin' unnatural about 'em. Deceptively well-balanced, wickedly sharp - just plain deadly.

I've put down me share of these creatures - and your share too fer that matter. Here be what ya need to know. . . . The vrykul are fearless in a fight.

6226,Residue Rendezvous,Return to Alchemist Adrianna while infected with Orange and Green Blight. ,"Professor Putricide has been holed up in his foul laboratory, experimenting and refining increasingly lethal strains of blight to be used against us. If only we could obtain pure samples of the toxins, our researchers could concoct an antidote that would save countless lives.

6229,Respite for a Tormented Soul,Use the Life Crystals to preserve Sindragosa's Essence. ,"Take this Life Crystal, and have your companions take one as well. It contains potent energies from the verdant Dragonshrine in Dragonblight, and it was my own secret to resisting the dark magics of this place for so long. When you face Sindragosa, battle her until she is weakened, and then have your companions use these Crystals to coax out the essence that is dormant within her. If you then defeat her, you should be able to recover it and return it to Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight. "

Unfortunately, I'm not getting anything up here.  If I could get near an underground water source, my crystal would pick up the signals much more clearly. I've heard of an underground pond as well as a well in a cellar below us.  This whole place is crawling with ghosts however, and venturing there would be hazardous for someone my age.  What do you say; will you help an old man and perform the scrying for me? "
6275,Chamber of Secrets,The Argent Dawn Emissary wants you to search the chamber of Tenris Mirkblood within the Servant's Quarters of Karazhan. ,"Excellent, an experienced adventurer. Precisely what we need. There has been talk from the Kirin Tor guarding Medivh's tower that something is amiss with Karazhan. There is a new power lurking within, one that answers neither to the Guardian's magic nor the Legion. From what they've scouted, it appears it is an elven prince called Tenris Mirkblood, and there is reason to believe he serves the Scourge. Go, my friend, investigate Mirkblood's chamber, and return with any information you might find. "
6276,Archmage Alturus,Speak to Archmage Alturus outside of Karazhan in Deadwind Pass. ,"I was sent here by my mentor to look for assistance, but unfortunately I'm not allowed outside of Lower City and the individuals that frequent this establishment tend to be less than helpful. You do seem different, more like the adventurous type.  If you're interested in aiding our cause, speak to Archmage Alturus outside of Medivh's old dwelling, Karazhan. In the meantime, I'm going to see about gaining access to the rest of the city.  One of our old associates is rumored to be here. "
6277,Medivh's Journal,Archmage Alturus at Deadwind Pass wants you to go into Karazhan and speak to Wravien. ,"Your name is getting around, <name>.  You've made your way into and out of Karazhan - more than most mortals can claim. I need to ask a special favor of you.  As part of our research, the Violet Eye has been trying to track down Medivh's own journal. Unfortunately, none of the agents we've sent inside have come out. Wravien was the last to be sent; see if you can find him and see about any leads on the journal. "
6278,The Master's Terrace,Go to the Master's Terrace in Karazhan and read Medivh's Journal. ,"Journal?  What journal? Oh, right.  That journal!  The Violet Eye sent me here for it.  It's all coming back now. < Kamsis points to a page in the journal. >This is the page that Alturus is interested in.  Did you know that while other people's journals serve as a record of their memories, Medivh's is literally just that? Try it.  Go to the Master's Terrace and read the page; you'll see just what I mean.  Might as well report to Alturus while you're at it.  I'm afraid I'll be here for a while. "
6279,Nightbane,Go to the Master's Terrace in Karazhan and touch the Blackened Urn to summon Nightbane. ,"You fulfilled your end of the deal.  I will now bind your essence to that of the dead blue dragon. There is an urn in the Master's Terrace, should you touch that urn, you'll now release its energy anl bring life back to the charred remains of Arcanagos.  Defeat the creature and retrieve its essence immediately!  You will need to take it to Alturus. Should you fail, the stars predict you will have let a great terror loose upon the skies. A terror known as Nightbane! "
6280,The Shade of Aran,Obtain Medivh's Journal and return to Kamsis at the Guardian's Library in Karazhan. ,"Let me think for a second.  The Violet Eye. . . Medivh's Journal. . .  Why yes, it's all coming back to me now. I believe I had the journal you're looking for before I started to read these scrolls. . . Aran. . . yes, Aran asked me for the book.  So nicely too.  I just had to give it to him.  He's Medivh's father after all, did you know? "
6281,Keanna's Log,Search the Guest Chambers inside Karazhan for Keanna's Log and bring it to Archmage Alturus outside Karazhan. ,"Who did you say you were looking for again?  Keanna? I once met someone with that name.  She was staying up at the guest chambers.  I was supposed to keep that a secret now, wasn't I? Did you say you were with the Violet Eye?  No, I've never heard of them. I need to return to my work now, if you don't mind. < Koren seems to have forgotten about you already. >"
6282,Kalynna's Request,Kalynna Lathred wants you to retrieve the Tome of Dusk from Grand Warlock Nethekurse in the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel and the Book of Forgotten Names from Darkweaver Syth in the Sethekk Halls in Auchindoun. ,"I left the Kirin Tor in pursuit of knowledge forbidden by those of my order; it is beyond ironic that I am now asked to assist them with that very same knowledge. If I'm to perform this favor for you, you will have to do something for me first.  I want you to obtain two of the tomes I've been searching for. The first one is called the Tome of Dusk and is owned by the orc warlock known as Nethekurse.  The second, known as the Book of Forgotten Names, belongs to the arakkoa known as Darkweaver Syth. "

6285,Restless Activity,Bring 10 Ghostly Essences to Archmage Alturus outside of Karazhan. ,"As you may have noticed, the outside of Karazhan is crawling with ghostly beings. The reason for their existence is unknown and unknowns bother me! Bring me their ghostly essence so that I may study their nature. Karazhan has many secrets, <name>.  I'm determined to uncover all of them. "
6286,A Demonic Presence,Archmage Alturus wants you to destroy the Demonic Presence at the top of Karazhan. ,"Keanna's last few entries confirm our suspicions of a demonic presence inside Karazhan. She detected the arrival of a Burning Legion agent whose location she describes as coming from the top of the tower. Her entries stop there. Karazhan is a very important place, <class>.  It is a portal into the nether, a beacon shining into other worlds.  The possible repercussions of it falling into the wrong hands are unthinkable.  This demonic intrusion must be stopped.  And you, <name>, are the only one with a key. "
6287,Distinguished Service,Bring your Violet Signet to Archmage Leryda at Deadwind Pass after obtaining Revered reputation with the Violet Eye. ,"You have not disappointed us, <name>.

6290,In Good Hands,Speak to Gradav at the Guardian's Library in Karazhan. ,Was I supposed to be looking for this journal?  It can't be. . . I don't quite recall. . . Of course!  It is Gradav you're thinking of.  He was looking for the book when I got here.  Surely he must've found it by now; why don't you go ask him about it? I'd lend you a hand. . . but these books are just so. . . interesting! 
6291,Down the Violet Path,Bring your Violet Signet to Archmage Leryda at Deadwind Pass after obtaining Honored reputation with the Violet Eye. ,"You've chosen your path, <class>.

6297,Assessing the Situation,Find Koren inside Karazhan. ,"Now that we've found a way back into Medivh's Tower - or rather you have - the first thing we need to do is try to get a sense of what the situation inside is. One of our agents who had managed to infiltrate Karazhan kept an encoded log of her observations.  Unfortunately her death was confirmed shortly before Karazhan was shut down. Koren, Karazhan 's blacksmith, was under our pay.  Though not a member of the Violet Eye, he should be able to help us find Keanna's log.  Look for him inside. "

Can't you see I'm in pieces?  It really hurts. I see that Karazahan hasn't trapped you.  You must know about Kadghar and the Violet Eye then. You're going to need to find someone who can put me back together.  Koren. . . he was our agent once. . . he's nearby.  I hope you're on our good side.  If so, he can help! "

6308,The Violet Eye,Speak to Archmage Alturus outside Karazhan. ,"A great responsibility has been bestowed upon you, <name>.  If the signs that the Violet Eye has observed are to be trusted, then you must help them. For all my disagreements with Cedric, the work that men like Alturus do is still important.  Beware that they do not use you, however.  Remember it is you who the key is bound to, not them.

0,Vault of the Wardens: Demon's Bile,"Craft a Skaggldrynk, then go to the Vault of the Wardens and bathe the crucible in the bile of Grimoira. ","The key to a crucible like this is that it must be bathed in the foulest of fel energy. I hate to say it, but the most efficient method of accomplishing such a feat is to subject it to the bile of a demon. Yes, I said the bile of a demon. Ready to get to work? In the Vault of the Wardens, such a demon exists. An imp mother by the name of Grimoira.  The door to her room is sealed by an invisible lock. I'd suggest bringing some Skaggldrynk with you. Use it when you get to her door. "
1,Elixir Master,Bring a variety of flasks to an alchemy trainer in any capital city. ,"Elixirs are all about potency!  If you want to become an elixir master, I can teach you. I can't just train anyone, and I require proof that you are devoted before we continue.  Several flasks should be sufficient to show your dedication. Remember <name>, you can only learn ONE specialization, so if you complete your elixir training, then potion and transmutation specialization will no longer be available. "
2,The Price of the Black Market,"Collect a Silver Hair of Khadgar, a Blood of Sargeras, 5 Kaldorei Ginger Wine and 5 Moist Azsunian Feta. ","I may have what you're looking for, burettes you say? Not a very common item. For that, I require a moderate favor. Nothing too big, just a few things really. A silver hair from a high-ranking archmage. . . the blood of a titan, and, oh. . . some wine and cheese. What? ! I have appetites that need satiating. "
3,Ascending Alchemy,"Bring Funen 75 Astral Glory, 5 Primal Sargerite and a Bound Infernal Alchemist Stone. ","I've seen other alchemists come through our camp carrying interesting looking trinkets. I believe they refer to them as. . . ""alchemist stones""? I can sense the power they radiate, but they appear fel-tainted. The herb that grows on this planet is particularly good at cleansing corruption. I use it to purify the primal sargerite that's often found amongst the herbs. I'm certain that if we used a purified sargerite with one of those stones, we could elevate the power within it. "
4,Potion Master,Bring a large supply of potions to an alchemy trainer in any capital city. ,"Potions, potions, potions.  Can I teach you about potions! You're going to have to bring me samples of your work, so I know you're ready. Remember <name>, you can only learn ONE specialization, so if you complete your potion training, then elixir and transmutation specialization will no longer be available. "
5,Missing Shipments,Alchemist Deucus Valdera in Dalaran wants you to locate supplies lost near the water in Azsuna. ,"Now that we've gotten to know each other, perhaps you can lend me a hand. My weekly supply shipment was lost when my longtime courier--you know, old whatsername--was shot out of the sky over the shores of Azsuna. Surely a hardy sort like you could retrieve my lost goods. "
6,Strange Spherical Stone,Infuse the stone with several Golden Lotus. ,"This beautiful stone clearly has magical potential. . . at least to one trained in alchemy.  You are certain that with the right herbs native to Pandaria, this stone could become very useful. "
7,Maw of Souls: A Hope in Helheim,"Retrieve a crate of Dragur Dust from Heroic: Maw of Souls, craft a Flask of the Seventh Demon and return both items to Alard in Dalaran. ","For this last ingredient, well. . . <Alard begins pondering for a moment, then nods his head. >Yes, that's the only way. For this last one, you'll need to go to the land of the damned, Helheim. Well, not there exactly, but aboard the boat that ferries the dead across the Maw of Souls. Upon that boat may be the final ingredient we need. It's called Dragur Dust. Keep an eye out for it. Also, one needs to be quick when adding this ingredient. I'll need something to heighten my reflexes. "
8,A Mysterious Text,Bring the Runewritten Tome to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"You found a water-logged tome near the bones of a massive creature. Written in an unfamiliar language, the book is adorned with runes and alchemical symbols. Perhaps another alchemist would be able to tell you more. "
9,Flasking for a Favor,Seek out Barm Stonebreaker at the Ironhorn Enclave in Highmountain. ,"You know, this mixing flask didn't suffer terrible damage. I'm positive it can just be repaired. I'm no expert in glass repair, but I've heard of someone who is--a tauren by the name of Barm Stonebreaker. He's a smith by trade, but those who know him say he was born to work glass. Those tauren don't work for free, so you may be in for some work yourself. "
10,Lining the Crucible,"Gather 1 Blood of Sargeras, 1 Felhide, 2 Felwort, and 100 Yseralline Seeds. ",The first step in making this crucible useful is to restore the lining of its interior. That's going to require supplies you'll either gather yourself or obtain through trade with fellow adventurers. Felwort and yseralline seeds are familiar to herbalists. Felhide is obtained through skinning. Blood of Sargeras can be found all over the Broken Isles. 
11,Get Your Mix On,Deucus Valdera in Dalaran wants you to craft some new potions. ,"Let's see. . . potion stains on your tabard, crushed herbs on your boots. . . I know a fellow alchemist when I see one! We will do good work together, the two of us. I trust you're not averse to learning new tricks. Be sure to use my state-of-the-art alchemy table. I built her myself! "
12,Elixirs for the Bladeleafs,Bring 6 Elixirs of Lion's Strength and 2 Elixirs of Minor Defense to Syral Bladeleaf in Dolanaar. ,"Our herb and alchemy shop is booming, but my husband spends so much time mixing potions that we never have time for each other. Can you help us? If you can bring me a supply of pre-made elixirs, then I would be happy to trade with you.  I have some rare herbs that you might find useful. "
13,Testing the Calibration,Test the Malloric Burettes' calibration by crafting a variety of potions. ,"Now that you have the burettes calibrated, it's time to test them out! The only way to be sure is by crafting a sufficient quantity of a variety of potions. Glamorous work? No, but the most important reagent in alchemy is a bit of elbow grease! "
14,"Black Rook Hold: Heavy, But Helpful","Retrieve some Sabelite Sulfate from Heroic: Black Rook Hold, craft a Flask of the Countless Armies and return both items to Alard in Dalaran. ","The next ingredient on the list will supposedly add strength to the mix, according to Deucus. I've heard of it before, but haven't really used it. It's called Sabelite Sulfate, and it's said the elves of Black Rook Hold use it in their blacksmithing. Something like that won't just be lying around. You may have to delve deep into the hold to find it. And due to its weight, I may need a concoction of yours to compensate, something to give me a bit more strength. "
15,Calibration Experts,Take the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to skilled alchemists for calibration. ,"It will take the cooperation of several highly skilled sorts to calibrate these burettes for a variety of substances. Chemist Emmara is an old friend from the Undercity who has helped me with similar endeavors. Thunder Bluff smells like a barn to me, but Jana Winterhoof is an alchemist with exacting standards. And while I'd never travel to Booty Bay without a lock on my wallet, Tryks Pourtrue has proven reliable and fair. "
16,In With the New,Bring the newly forged High-Capacity Decoction Conduit to Deucus in Dalaran. ,"Well, here's your new conduit. Try not to break this one, I really don't feel like making another. Oh, and tell your boss, Deucus, that he owes me big time for this. "
17,Silver Filigree Flask,Fill the vial with a potent alchemical mixture. ,"You have found a beautiful silver flask decorated with ornate filigree.  With the right materials and your skill in alchemy, it could become quite magical. "
18,A Recipe for Success,Bring the torn paper back to Elric. ,"Looking it over more closely, you're convinced that this must be the missing half of the recipe you came for. An odd signature completes the recipe, signed, ""Silas Darkmoon"". Elric should be very pleased to see this once again. "
19,A Fragile Crucible,Bring the Fragile Demonsbreath Crucible to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"I have customers asking for alchemist stones, but I'm unable to make any until I replace my crucible. In order to create a new one, we'll need a few things, but first we'll need a proper container. Something that can be augmented to withstand a demon's breath. There's a place in Suramar which the Legion has occupied. There surely must be a device there we can take that will be suitable for our needs. "
20,The Emerald Nightmare: Rage Fire,Travel to the Emerald Nightmare and acquire Nythendra's Heart. ,"Now that we have all the ingredients assembled, we need one last thing. The fire of my forges burn hot, but not hot enough to work these ingredients into glass. For that, we need more heat. The heat of a dragon, to be exact. I'm aware of one that has emerged from the Emerald Dream in a corrupted state. Corrupted or not, a dragon's heart burns with enough heat to melt the strongest of materials. Bring me its heart and you'll have your conduit. "
21,Limited Supplies,Go to the Petrified Forest and reclaim 12 Used Vials. ,"Hello, <name>. It's good to see a fellow alchemist again. I've been supplying our camp with necessary potions to deal with the demons, but lately I've been running low on supplies. Normally when scouting parties go out, they return with empty vials, but as of late fewer have been returning. I try to recycle as much as I can, so you see, those vials are precious to me. If you'd be willing to go out and retrieve them, I could show you what I've been making to help combat the demons. "
22,Halls of Valor: The Prime Ingredient,"Retrieve the Eternity Sand from Heroic: Halls of Valor, craft a Flask of Ten Thousand Scars and return both items to Alard in Dalaran. ","This first ingredient can only be obtained by visiting the next realm. Fortunately for us, there's a gate in Stormheim that can take you there. In the Halls of Valor, there is a sand that's used for polishing their architecture. Eternity Sand, it's called. I'll need an ample amount of it as the base for the new glass. This ingredient won't be easy to work with either. I'll need something to keep me going, you know, keep my stamina up. "
23,Ley Hunting,Travel to key locations in Azsuna and use the Depleted Leyflame Burner to collect ley energy. ,"The leyflame burner you brought me is useless! This is why I never trust an engineer. . . The burner needs to be charged in areas that resonate with ley energy before it can be used to craft our newfound alchemy recipes. Lucky for us, Azsuna is rich with such power. "
24,Casting the First Stone,Craft a Potion of Durability and a Potion of Shifting States using the recipes given to you. ,"Hey dere <name>, gimme a hand with dis, would ya? <Kumali motions you over to her. >I got dis recipe dat I've been trying to remember de rest of, but I'm having de hardest time coming up with de right ingredients. Ya see, my partner ran off with de other half of de recipe on account of a disagreement we had. But dis stone, it's a treasure like no other. Grab some vials and start mixing dese ingredients together. Let's see if dey are de right ones. "
25,Tracking the Trackers,Kill 14 Feflame Scavengers at the Annihilan Pits. ,"<name>, have I told you about my tracking potion? Our scouts use it to track demons, especially their ""fiends"". Those particular creatures tend to consume the astral glory in the area, making it difficult to replenish our stores of the herb. If you could help thin their numbers out, it would greatly help us from having to search elsewhere for supplies. You can find many of them in the Annihilan Pits. I could also teach you the recipe for this potion for your effort. "
26,Going Underground,See Ms. ,"We're so close to replacing all my equipment, <name>. In order to make flasks again, we need to be able to precisely measure each ingredient. For that, we need to replace my burette assembly. Unfortunately, burettes aren't easy to come by. We may be able to procure some though through other means by. . . <Deucus looks around and beckons you closer. >Going underground, so to say. As in, the Black Market. Go see Ms. Xiulan. Mum's the word. "
27,A Dormant Burner,Purchase a Depleted Leyflame Burner from Hobart Grapplehammer and bring it to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,I've heard that someone over in the engineering shop is selling a burner that might be usable. You could likely negotiate a fairer price than I could! The shop is just across the street. I'll make a note on your map for you. 
28,A Recipe for Success,Bring the torn paper back to Kumali. ,"Looking it over more closely, you're convinced that this must be the missing half of the recipe you came for. An odd signature completes the recipe, signed, ""Silas Darkmoon"". Kumali should be very pleased to see this once again. "
29,Neltharion's Lair: Potent Powder,Acquire Precipitating Powder in Neltharion's Lair and bring it to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"I've heard rumors that the ancient drogbar collected powder from the residue of dragon's breath. If it's true that Neltharion's Lair lies somewhere below us, it seems a likely source. Go there and try to find a replacement for my powder. "
30,Vault of the Wardens: Bendy Glass Tubes,Bring the Bendy Glass Tubes to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"You find tubing formed from a bendable sort of glass. It appears as though Grimoira was using it to suck out the insides of her victims. Its magical properties, however, would seem ideal for use on an advanced alchemy table. "
31,Trading for Dreams,Use the Nightborne Flask to craft an Ysera's Dream Draught. ,"From the look of you, I take it you're an alchemist, yes? I'd be willing to trade my services with you for a price that I deem is fair. I have been away from Suramar for some time now. I long for an Ysera's Dream Draught. To concoct it, you'll need some dreamleaf as well as the leaves of a Dreamer's Tear. One grows not to far from here in the clearing of some ruins. Take my flask, make this drink for me, and I'll do as you ask. "
32,Ancient Knowledge,Observe Deucus Valdera as he attempts one of the vrykul recipes. ,"The tome contains a wealth of ancient vrykul recipes! Why, I could be the first alchemist in untold ages to craft one! How fortunate for you, friend <name>, that you are here to bear witness to my greatness! Awful kind of that Svena person to die and leave her book for us, eh? Silly vrykul. . . "
33,Eye of Azshara: Put a Cork in It,Go to the Eye of Azshara and retrieve the Advanced Corks for Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"A thought occurred to me recently, <name>. The naga have been known to hoard all manner of potions, so they might have the sort of corks we need. In my educated opinion, I believe the best place to start searching is around the Eye of Azshara! Try not to waste your time in there dealing with the naga's goings on, just look for some replacement corks. "
34,Calibration Experts,Take the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to skilled alchemists for calibration. ,"It will take the cooperation of several highly skilled sorts to calibrate these burettes. Myshalla Streambreeze in Feralas has demonstrated admirable attention to detail. I loathe Ironforge, but a resident named Krimple Proxmeasure is known for his precision. And while I'd never travel to Booty Bay without a lock on my wallet, Tryks Pourtrue has proven reliable and fair. . . mostly. "
35,Cardinal Ruby,Linzy Blackbolt in Dalaran wants you to successfully transmute 5 epic gems with your alchemy skill. ,"The Cardinal Ruby is said to be the finest gem in all of Northrend.  It sparkles like a crystal rose under the sun. Before I teach you this recipe, I ask that you perform five epic gem transmutes to prepare your mind.  You can do any you like, and even do the same transmute many times. Return to me when you are truly ready. "
36,There's a Scribe for That,Bring the Runewritten Tome to Professor Pallin in Dalaran. ,"Fine! I admit, even my considerable intellect can't translate the strange tome you discovered. No doubt the water smears made it illegible. Say, one of those dimwitted scribes down the block owes me a favor. This sort of busywork is just his cup of tea. "
37,Channeling Our Efforts,Talk to Alard Schmied about the list of things you need done. ,"While it's no secret my time is more valuable than. . . well, anyone's, I fear I must step in and help to replace my decoction conduit. You will also play a crucial part in this, <name>, as my liaison with the blacksmiths. The thought of getting soot on my robes curls my toes. Here's a list of what we'll need done. Meanwhile I'll be out gathering the rest of what's needed. "
38,Mending the Filter,Try to find the whereabouts of a tailor in Val'sharah who can help you mend the silk. ,Bringing back the cloth in such a manner would not be beneficial to Deucus. Perhaps there's a tailor here in Val'sharah who'd be willing to mend it for you. The priestess who helped you earlier may know of such a person. 
39,Casting the First Stone,Craft a Potion of Durability and a Potion of Shifting States using the recipes given to you. ,"Would you mind helping me out with something, <name>? <Elric motions you over to him. >You see, I have this recipe that, well, I only have half of currently. I've been trying to remember the other half but just can't seem to recall it. My EX-partner tore the recipe and ran off with the other half over a disagreement we were having. But the stone it makes is invaluable. How about you grab some vials and start mixing the ingredients on this list. Perhaps together we can figure this out. "
40,Ocular Extracts,Gather 10 Highlands Mauler Eyes and return them to Elric. ,"My next idea involves a creature whose eyes are useful for certain alchemical recipes. At least for potions they are. Hopefully they're just what we need for this and there aren't any further. . . miscalculations. Although, I don't entirely recall seeing them on the recipe's ingredient list. . . but my memory isn't exactly as good as it used to be. Oh, you caught me rambling. How about you get those eyes and I'll start making the preparations for them. "
41,A Deathly Draught,Collect 15 Deathshrooms. ,"De first thing I'd like you to do for me is to gather some deathshroom. Don't worry if you're not skilled at herbalism, they're very easy to pick. Dey typically grow where death lingers in the air. I'd try to de Frogmarsh to de southeast. De trolls dere have been making sacrifices of de creature dat inhabit de area. "
42,We Need More Powder! ,Obtain Katterin's Alchemy Kit from Katterin the Blistered in Stormheim. ,"The substance you brought me appears to be precipitating powder, a highly volatile reagent used by the vrykul in their recipes. There are rumors that a vrykul elder named Katterin has built up quite a store of this powder. A substance this dangerous needs to be in our hands, not hers! "
43,The Search for Knowledge,Look for ancient relics  on the shoreline of Azsuna. ,"While you were out gallivanting, did you notice any lost relics around Azsuna? My sources tell me there are treasures to be found. These rumors merit investigation! "
44,Return the Filter,Return the Mended Shaldorei Silk to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"What was torn has now been mended. I hope you put this Shaldorei silk to good use. Now, run along. "
45,Changing the Scenery,Go to Stormsong Valley and transmute Barberry Shrubs into Shrubbery Bubbles and gather 6 of them. ,"The stone this recipe becomes is a transmutation stone. What if the missing reagents to make it come from something that's gone through the transmutation process? I'm willing to try anything at this point. Here's an old recipe my ex-partner devised. He used to go out to Stormsong Valley, just south of the Highland Flats and change the shrubs there into bubbles. Bring back some of those bubbles and we'll see if they're what we've been missing. "
46,Forlorn Filter,Speak with a Temple Priestess at the Temple of Elune to see if you can acquire some Shaldorei Silk. ,Next on the list of things to replace are my filters. Now I'm sure you've concluded that an alchemist of my caliber uses only the finest of tools when mixing my potions. The elves at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah use Shaldorei silk to craft their robes. Perhaps they'd be willing to part with some for my filters. 
47,Furbolg Firewater,Acquire skins of Smolderhide Firewater from the furbolg camp in Val'sharah. ,"Oh! I recognize these corks you brought me, <name>. I recently acquired several from a furbolg tribe in Val'sharah. They need sturdy corks to keep a tight seal on that potent firewater they brew. We need more firewater potions--the corks would make an ideal addition to our alchemy table! "
48,Thanks for Flasking,Take the repaired Dual-Chambered Mixing Flask to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"Here is your flask, good as new. A fair trade for those potions. Be a little more careful with your breakables next time! "
49,An Imprecise Burette,Bring the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to Deucus in Dalaran. ,"Here are your burettes. Should you ever be in the need of anything else, don't hesitate to ask. < Ms. Xiulan holds up the hair and continues to chuckle to herself. >"
50,Chemically Compounded,Meet Quintin at the cave he mentioned. ,"That appears to be everything. This latest transmutation will be my finest yet. And your prize waits at its completion, apprentice. But I don't believe this is an appropriate place to test it out. It may draw too much attention. There's a cave not terribly far from here which would prove to be a more suitable setting for such a test. Meet me there when you're ready to witness why transmutation is the only branch of alchemy worth learning. "
51,Ocular Extracts,Gather 10 Razorwing Eyes and return them to Kumali. ,"So dere's a creature in dese lands whose eyes are perfect for alchemical recipes. Dey might just be de thing we need to finish dis project. Although, I don't remember seeing dem on de full recipe list de last time I saw it, ya see. . . But my memory isn't quite what it used to be. Gah! I'm rambling too much. Get me some eyes, will ya, <name>? "
52,Changing the Scenery,Go to The Slough and transmute Barberry Shrubs into Shrubbery Bubbles and gather 6 of them. ,"Or maybe de problem is dat we don't need regular reagents. Maybe we need something dat only comes from being transmuted. Anything's worth a shot at dis point. Here is a recipe my old partner left behind. He used to go out to de Slough and change de shrubs into bubbles, ya see. Why, you might ask? 'Cause he loved transmuting everything. Part of de reason we never saw eye to eye. Anyways, bring me back some of dose bubbles and we'll see if we can use dem to make dis stone. "
53,A Deathly Draught,Collect 15 Deathshrooms. ,"The first thing I'd like you to do for me is to gather some deathshroom. Don't worry if you're not skilled at herbalism, they're very easy to pick. They typically grow where death lingers in the air. I'd try to the Crimson Forest to the south. The creatures that have overrun it seem to be covered in deathly magics. "
54,A Stone's Throw,Use the Bag of Transmutation Stones on blood trolls and kill them. ,"Now dis ingredient you might have some fun getting, little mixah. I'm gonna give you dese stones. They're able to turn things into other things. Dose blood trolls, de ones giving de rest of us a bad name? Dey drink de weirdest things and it taints their bodies. I need their blood to finish my work here, but without de taint. Dese stones will turn dem into weaker creatures. Although, sometimes de stones turn dem into other things. . . Be careful with dem. "
55,A Possible Solution,Travel to Drustvar and seek out Quintin Whalgrene. ,"Nothing appears to be working. I can't believe I'm proposing this but I actually think we need to contact Quintin. Well, you should, as I doubt he'll speak to me. Perhaps you could convince him to part with the other half of the recipe? Last time I heard, he was staying in Drustvar near Arom's Stand. There's a lot of alchemists in those parts, but he shouldn't be too hard to find. Best not to tell him I sent you. He may not be as forthcoming with the recipe. "
56,Alchemical Equations,"Hey, &lt; name&gt; . ","Hey, <name>. I recently created some new recipes I'd love to share with you. "
57,A Possible Solution,Travel to Nazmir and seek out Zukashi. ,"None of dese things are working. I can't believe I'm saying dis, but I think you're gonna have to find Zukashi. Maybe you could convince him to give up de other half of de recipe. He's pretty full of himself, but he isn't unreasonable. Last time I heard, he's staying in Nazmir near Gloom Hollow. Maybe it's best to tell him dis isn't about me. "
58,Chemically Compounded,Meet Zukashi at the cave he mentioned. ,"Now dat I have everything I need, I can finish dis project. My latest transmuation will be my finest yet! But dis is not de place to test it. It could draw too much attention. If you want to see it for yourself, little mixah, meet me to de north. Dere is a cave dere dat should be a safe spot for testing dis out. "
59,A Stone's Throw,Use the Bag of Transmutation Stones on witches and kill them. ,"You may enjoy getting this next reagent for me. I have some special stones that have transmutative qualities, especially on living things. It's not too unlike the one you're trying to make. The witches that plague these lands are imbued with magic. As is their blood. I need their blood to finish my latest project, but in an altered form. These stones should turn them into weaker creatures. Although, sometimes the opposite occurs. . . I'd recommend handling them with care. "
60,Alchemical Equations,"&lt; name&gt; , nice to see you again. ","<name>, nice to see you again. I've been working on some new recipes dat I think you'd be interesting in learning. "
61,Unspeakable Power,Meet with Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher in Suramar. ,"<name>, I received an urgent message from the High Examiner requesting your presence. He's finally found something powerful-- VERY powerful--and he wants your help in recovering it. Be careful down there, <name>. Tae'thelan can be a tad fanatical when it comes to artifacts that hold any sort of energy. "
62,Narrowing Down,Survey Suramar and uncover 10 Tattered Highborne Scrolls. ,"I was right about the nightborne here having objects of great power. I found an ancient text referring to such an object called the Orb of Sciallax. From what I recall in studying the War of the Ancients, Sciallax was a demon lord who came to Suramar and offered the elves at the time a powerful artifact in return for their servitude to the Legion. I haven't discovered the exact location yet as to the whereabouts, but perhaps some digging can yield us an answer. "
63,Uncovering the Orb of Sciallax,Meet Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher at the entrance to the chamber where the Orb of Sciallax is held. ,We'll need to hurry before the nightborne realize what we're after. I'm bringing the goblins along in case we run into any obstacles along the way. I've marked the location of the entrance to the chamber the Orb resides in on your map. Meet me there as soon as you're ready and we'll claim this artifact for our own. 
64,The Right Path,Meet with Lessah in Highmountain. ,"This new shop is shaping up quite nicely, I think. Still, there's so much left to organize. <name>, Lessah has requested your presence in Highmountain. Something about a moose? I'm not sure to what she's speaking of, but as soon as you have a chance, please go see her. "
65,Laying to Rest,Find 600 Bone Fragments of Eche'ro and return them to Lessah in Highmountain. ,"If I was able to find a bone fragment in what appeared to be a random location, then that means Eche'ro's bones must be scattered around Highmountain. We must find his remains and give him the proper burial he deserved. Oh, I'm sorry, in case you weren't aware, Eche'ro was Huln Highmountain's mount and companion. He deserves to be honored as Huln once was. "
66,Corrupted Studies,Survey digsites in Stormheim and bring Brann back 200 War of the Ancients Fragments. ,"Stormheim is steeped with artifacts from tha War of the Ancients. Demon artifacts ta be exact. I think these artifacts can clue us into some knowledge about their leader, Sargeras. I've already found some fragments to a titan disc, but need ta find the rest of 'em. I need ya ta dig around Stormheim and see if ye can find any more fragments so we can reassemble the disc. "
67,Neltharion's Lair: Misdirected,Go to Neltharion's Lair and recover the Ancient Highmountain Artifact. ,"I've been looking into the history of Huln Highmountain, a legendary warrior from the War of the Ancients whom this very land is named after. Allegedly some of his personal effects were carried here after his death and have been lost in time. After some digging around I believe I have discovered the location of one of his artifacts to be in a place called Neltharion's Lair. I'm no fighter, <name>, but you are. Will you go and recover this artifact for me? "
68,Out of the Frying Pan,Meet with Brann in Azsuna. ,"Oh hello, <name>. I tell you, ever since I was given this shop, it's been nothing but a headache. I can't seem to ever find what I'm looking for. Which reminds me, Brann Bronzebeard has sent for you. He's in Azsuna tracking down more pieces of whatever it is he's searching for. Now where'd those pewter drinking cups go. . . "
69,Bits and Pieces,Meet with Brann Bronzebeard in Stormheim. ,"So many artifacts to catalogue, and never enough time. Good to see you again, <name>. Brann Bronzebeard and the Explorers' League are in Stormheim right now and could use your help tracking down an ancient titan relic. Brann can fill you in on the details when you arrive. "
70,The Apocalypse Bringer,Talk to Brann when you're ready to activate the device. ,"Right, well, I managed to piece the device back together. I guess I'll jes' turn it on when you're ready and we'll see what happens, yea? "
71,Academic Exploration,Meet with Tae'thelan in Azsuna. ,"<name>, good to see you. What do you think of my shop so far? Not too bad for just one person, huh? By the way, High Examiner Tae'thalan has been digging around Azsuna, and asked that I send you to see him. Knowing him, he probably thinks he's found yet another world-shatteringly powerful artifact. "
72,Dark Iron Contingency Plan,"These are definitely some sort of plans, but for what you aren't certain. ","Interesting!  It seems as if the Dark Iron dwarves had a strategic plan in the case of an elemental invasion.  As the elemental forces are ageless and unchanging, it seems as if these ancient techniques are still viable even today. "
73,History of Highmountain,Meet with Lessah in Highmountain. ,"Let's see, one. . . two. . . three. . . oh, hello <name>. Sorry I didn't see you come in. Things have been hectic around here. I could really use an assistant. I do have something for you though, a fellow archaeologist named Lessah has been asking for someone to help her in Highmountain. I thought you'd be the perfect person for the job. "
74,A Beacon of Hope,Go to the location Tae'thelan marked on your map and survey the area until you find the artifact. ,"I've marked the location of the artifact on your map. It's in a rather hostile location, so I'd like you to go there and find it. When you've recovered it, bring it back to me so I can discern its power. "
75,Echoes of My Ancestors,Complete 25 Highborne Archaeology Projects. ,"This land holds many secrets and many artifacts of ancient times. From what I've been able to discern there's an artifact of great power close to here. I just need to narrow down its location. I'd like you to dig up more artifacts and learn what you can. When you feel you've done enough research, come back to me and share your knowledge. "
76,Drogbar Deception,Recover the ancient necklace and bring it back to Lessah. ,"According to my research and the information you gave me, I've isolated the location of the necklace. It's deep in a drogbar cave, and I'm willing to bet they're not just going to hand it over to you, <name>. I need you to recover that necklace at any cost. "
77,Worth Its Weight,Meet with Tae'thelan in Suramar. ,"<name>, if you were a crate of black trilobites, where do you think I would have put you? <Dariness begins looking around the shop. >Oh, that reminds me. Tae'thelan has requested your presence. He's onto something in Suramar and needs your help. "

79,The Gates of Valor,Obtain 6 Chipped Titan Disc Fragments by surveying near the Gates of Valor in Stormheim. ,"Ye'd not normally know it, but the terraced entrance to the vrykul's Halls o' Valor is a fine place for findin' ancient artifacts. Problem is, the place is just a big mess with demons at the time. Well, ye've not got much choice. If the disc isn't elsewhere in Stormheim, it most likely lies at the Gates of Valor. Good luck, <name>. "
80,Sifting Through the Rubble,Survey different areas around Suramar until you find the 6 missing Jewels of the Crown. ,"Then I believe it's clear what we must do next. Find the jewels. They're bound to be here somewhere in Suramar, so we better start looking. I'll coordinate the search from here, while you and my assistants look for the jewels. "
81,A New Lead,Meet with Lessah in Highmountain. ,"<name>, Lessah in Highmountain has been asking for you. Apparently she's caught a lead on some ancient piece of armor that Huln Highmountain used to wear. When you can, make your way out to her. "
82,Vengeance of the Wildhammer,"These old bones appear dwarven, possibly from the original builders of Grim Batol. ","After comparing the two very closely, you are sure these are the remains of the Wildhammer.  The treachery committed against them fills your heart with anger. "
83,Fragments of the Fjords,Meet with Brann Bronzebeard in Stormheim. ,"<name>, have you seen my ledger around here? I seemed to have misplaced it when I was stowing some canopic jars. Oh, nevermind. Brann Bronzebeard has sent for you though. He's in Stormheim continuing his research. Make your way out to him and let him know I'm still waiting on those flayed-skin chronicles he found. "
84,One Step Closer,Meet with Brann in Suramar. ,"<name>! I just heard that Brann Bronzebeard - that crazy, titan-obsessed dwarf - has decided to go hunting for his precious disc in Suramar. Talk about the last place you'd want to go digging around, given the current events. I'm sure he could use your help. "
85,The Reliquary Calls,Meet with Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher in Azsuna. ,"Tae'thelan of the Reliquary has asked me to send anyone who may be able to help them in Azsuna.

86,Fel Fragments,Deliver the crate of surveying equipment to Brann in Val'sharah. ,"Brann Bronzebeard has requested that I send him more surveying equipment, but I just don't have the time. Would you be a dear and take this crate to him, <name>? I'd truly appreciate it. "
87,Dark Secrets,Meet Brann at the entrance to the secret chamber. ,I fixed the key and am ready to open the chamber. Meet me there when you have a chance and we'll discover what waits inside together! 
88,Darkheart Thicket: Through the Fog,Obtain the Final Chapter of The Purple Hills of Eredath. ,"I can't believe that after all that searchin' ye did, it's still missing a chapter! I'm willin' ta bet that those satyrs got a hand on it and took it somewhere. Probably somewhere dark where no one could find it. I've heard rumors of a place, the Darkheart Thicket they call it, where the strongest of the satyrs are. If I had ta guess, I'd say ye need to go there and look around fer it. "
89,The Keys to Success,Bring the mold to Alard Schmied in Dalaran and have him help you forge a new set of keys. ,"I'd like you to take the mold to the blacksmith in Dalaran. Alard, I believe his name is. Have him help you forge a new set of keys. I found some writing on the back of the mold that may hold the answer to what these keys unlock. I'll stay here and try to translate the text. "

First I found an ancient text talking about a demon who harnessed the power of the titan disc I've been searching for. Then I found a device which supposedly is used to summon 'im! Only, it's missin' some pieces from what I can make out. I'm sure if we survey around Azsuna some more, those missin' pieces are sure ta turn up. "
94,What Once Was Lost,Go to the location marked on the map and recover the artifact in question. ,"That reminds me, I found a map to a chamber that may or may not hold something of value. It doesn't seem to have any power associated with it, which is why I'm handing it over to you. Here, take some more explosives. They may help speed of the process of finding it. "

I'm certain I can restore it if we can find the other bits. After that, we need to figure out what it's a key to. An' I think I know how to do that. I've been studying some of the artifacts I've found, and they seem to be pointing to a hidden chamber. I jes' need some more artifacts to study. "
110,Pristine Twin Stein Set,Put the artifact on display. ,"This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the Seat of Knowledge, so that lorewalkers and archaeologists can study it. "

121,Crystal Eyes,Interact with the two different resonating stones in Highmountain. ,"I've delved into the caves here and have discovered many ancient writings. The most interesting I've found are resonating crystals, where the drogbar have resided. Unfortunately, they aren't on very good terms with the tauren here and this has hindered my research. I thought, should there be any trouble with the drogbar, that you'd be able to handle them. I'd like you to continue my research and discover what you can about Huln. "
122,Might of the Earthen,"At first glance, this pillar seems very plain, but your knowledge of archaeology tells you differently. ","Ah ha!  You knew you'd seen this level of craftsmanship before.  Now, with the final piece. . . "

I have a plan though. I need ye ta eliminate potential areas where the disc could exist so we can narrow down where in Stormheim it might exist. You take part of the area an' I'll take the other part. Meet back here if ye find anythin'. "
125,Map of the Architects,"This stone obelisk is obviously some sort of layout or map, but it isn't completely readable. ","Yes. . . 'X' marks the spot!  This is a detailed map of the dungeon, a valuable find indeed. "

127,Surveying Student,Complete 20 successful surveys with Luron present. ,The reason I sent for someone was that I've been having trouble keeping up with my research and training my assistant.

129,Tried and True,Find the remaining 15 Azsunian Key Mold Pieces and return them to Tae'thelan. ,"I have realized through experience that the old methods are usually the best and for good reason. I'm done with alternate means of digging for now, and wish to focus on the right way to do things. That being said, I believe I've found a new powerful artifact and I'll do literally anything to have it. I've uncovered a fragment that appears to be a mold for a key. I now simply need the other pieces. "

I found something here that I think ye'll be interested in. It's a page of a book talking about the world of Argus. But before the demons destroyed it. Anyway, it's been me experience that if ye find one of something, there's sure ta be more of it around. Keep lookin' around Val'sharah for more of these pages and bring what ye find back ta me.

And if you know anything about goblins, you know that I'm talking about explosives. We've only run a few tests here at my camp, but I would appreciate your help in testing this method out in the field. I've marked a location on your map that has some particularly difficult digs. "

156,A Head for Metal,Collect 1 Crystallized Draconium inside the Cindershard Seam. ,"To fully utilize the potential of the Earth-Warder's forge, you must learn the basics of creating Obsidian Seared Alloy. Only then can you follow in the footsteps of Neltharion's greatest smiths.

Bring me a piece of Crystallized Draconium found deep within the Cindershard Seam. Then I shall gift you the knowledge you desire. "
157,Supplying the Front,Bring 6 Copper Axes and 6 Copper Chain Belts to Thorvald in the southern guard tower of Loch Modan. ,"The mountaineers of Loch Modan are fighting troggs, and having a busy time of it!  They need constant supplies of new armor and weapons if we're ever to get a handle on those troggs. That's why my colleague Thorvald is there, trying to keep the mountaineers in good gear.  So if you were to make some copper axes and copper chain belts and bring them to Thorvald, he would be obliged.  He might even share his knowledge with you. Thorvald is in Loch Modan's southern guard tower. "
158,The Firmament Stone,Speak with Barm Stonebreaker in Highmountain. ,"When working with felslate and demonsteel, one must use special equipment. Specifically, an anvil hard enough to withstand the energy given off when felslate is hammered. Urael and I no longer possess such an anvil. But your friends, the Highmountain tauren, do. Gain access to the Firmament Stone, their sacred anvil, and we can start working with demonsteel again. "
159,The Art of Demonsteel,Work with Muirn Ironhorn to craft a Demonsteel Bar. ,"The Firmament Stone is one of the few anvils beneath the sky that can tolerate the hammer strikes necessary to craft demonsteel. Here, I will show you. Two parts leystone, one part felslate. No heat, no tempering, just pure strength and finesse. Try it. I will coach you. "
160,Strange New Ores,Obtain 10 Leystone Ore. ,"You smell that, smith? Ahhhh. . . that there's the smell of opportunity. Dalaran's taken us to some strange new shores, filled with mysterious metals. I'm tethered to my shop here, but you. . . you've got the freedom to explore and mine at will. Bring me something interesting, and we'll see what we can make with it. "
161,Leystone Mastery,"Speak with Thala Steeltotem to purchase a Leystone Armor Stand, then hang all eight pieces of Leystone Armor on it. ","Smiths that seek access to the Firmament Stone must first prove complete mastery over leystone. Craft an entire set of Leystone Armor, then submit it to me for inspection. Thala can provide you with an armor stand. "
162,Empyrial Strength,Craft an Empyrial Breastplate. ,"I see my armor's caught your interest. It's made from the finest material on Argus: empyrium. I actually specialize in crafting breastplates. I could show you how to craft one, but you'll need to bring your own supplies, I'm afraid. Our stores of the ore are low and we need all that we have. But here are the plans so you'll know what you need to find. . . "
163,Gearing Redridge,Tormus Deepforge wants you to bring 4 Runed Copper Belts and 4 Heavy Copper Mauls to Verner Osgood in Redridge. ,"We dwarves aren't the only ones fighting.  Our human allies have their hands full too! Redridge is under periodic attack from blackrock orcs, and their supply of equipment is always low.  If you were to help them out, I'm sure their resident blacksmith, Verner Osgood, would teach you a trick or two. "
164,Tribal Knowledge,Report back to Felsmith Nal'ryssa in Suramar. ,"First, however, you'll need proper patterns for demonsteel armor. While access to the stone is earned through hard work and perseverance, access to our recipes is limited to the trusted members of our tribe. Perhaps you should seek another smith if you wish to discuss demonsteel patterns. "
165,Advanced Quenching,Craft a pair of Hard Leystone Armguards for Alard. ,"Now that we have a frost mage at our disposal, testing this method out should be a cinch. Here are the plans for what I'd like you to make. Get to work and give me the armguards when you're finished. "
166,Demonsteel Armguards,"The armguards you've made are impressive, but you can provide the same level of protection without wasting so much raw material. ","The armguards you've made are impressive, but you can provide the same level of protection without wasting so much raw material. Here, let me show you. "
167,The Properties of Leystone,Observe Alard as he attempts to work with the leystone ore. ,"I've never seen anything like this ""leystone"" ore. It's light, like mithril, but it carries much more of a magical energy. . . more even than saronite or elementium. Let's try making something with it. How about a nice pair of gauntlets? "
168,Not Just Weapons and Armor,Craft 4 Hard Leystone Bars and 24 Hard Leystone Nails. ,"You know, we aren't just limited to armorsmithing and weaponsmithing. I regularly make chisels for the scribes, crucibles for the alchemists, and even thimbles for the tailors. They should sew in full plate gauntlets if they're really all that worried about their poor little thumbs. Anyhow, I have a recipe I think an adventurer like you might be interested in. Let's try it out. "
169,Between the Hammer. . . ,Bring Saris' Hammer back to his shop. ,"<name>, I fear that my spirit will remain bound to this place unless I am made whole again. Long ago, I discovered a cave near the coast behind Black Rook Hold. I explored the cave only to find an abominable creature that attacked me, causing me to drop my hammer as I fled. I need that hammer back if I am to be at peace. "
170,Hatecoil Hammerwork,Obtain a Masterwork Hatecoil Breastplate and a pair of Masterwork Hatecoil Pauldrons. ,"There may be a way to jump-start our research into leystone. I've heard reports of naga camps down in Azsuna. If they've been in Azsuna for long enough, their smiths have certainly started experimenting with leystone themselves. Be on the lookout for some leystone armor on the naga. . . ideally something more elaborate than a bracer. "
171,Ironhorn Leysmithing,Gather scrap metal around the Ironhorn Enclave. ,"I sense great strength in you, yet you refuse to wield it. We Ironhorn use double the metal of any normal blacksmith to craft our wares. There is also a technique in how you hammer such quantities of leystone that I will instruct you on. Use our scrap metal and hammer out the pieces for a gauntlet. I will weld the pieces together when you are finished. "
172,Chicken Scratch,Bring the Ancient Highborne Data Printout to Professor Pallin in Dalaran. ,"I think I have just the thing to extract the information from this core for you. <Timofey loads the core into the hopper of a clearly goblin-made machine, then covers his ears. >You may wish to avert your eyes, blacksmith. "
173,Nature Provides,Obtain 10 Foxflower. ,"This is interesting, it says that leystone reacts violently with anything it views as a contaminant. Our foreign-mined flux was enough to cause the small explosion. Local ingredients, however, have learned to coexist with leystone. Up in Highmountain, an herb called foxflower grows that can be turned into a suitable flux. Go and gather some foxflower that we can turn into a usable flux. "
174,Leysmithing Mastery,Follow Alard Schmied's recipes in your Blacksmithing recipe list to build some Handcrafted Leystone Gauntlets. ,"Well, now that we have the flux we can put it to work and see how it goes. Why don't you take a crack at it this time and make some gauntlets for me. I'll observe your work. . . from a distance. "
175,Maw of Souls: Hammered By The Storm,Go to the Maw of Souls and recover an Ancient Vrykul Hammer. ,"Your hammer looks weak, and would probably break upon striking the Firmament Stone. The vrykul master blacksmiths of old were known for the strength of their hammers. The only way to get our hands on such a hammer would be to go where vrykul go when they die. To the Maw of Souls. The goddess that resides over that realm is named Helya. She hoards the trinkets they bring for her own desires. Defeat her and you may be able to acquire such a hammer. "
176,Armor of the Ancients,Obtain 100 Ancient Demonsteel from humanoids in Broken Shore. ,"It is not just the hammers and my careful research that we need, <name>. We also need a lot of the very highest quality of ancient metal to make the final hammer. Enemies across Broken Shore that are able to wear armor often collect bits of Ancient Demonsteel here and there. Collect enough of it in your battles for our purposes. "
177,Grayheft,"Obtain Grayheft, Ancient Hammer of the Highmountain Tauren from Kubrul within the Deep Roads cavern. ","Our tribe regularly crafts legplates out of leystone. I will share our pattern with you. . . if you do me a favor. My father fell to the drogbar several years ago, and they took his hammer as a trophy. That hammer was in my family for countless generations. Now, it languishes in the hands of the vile drogbar, Kubrul. I would very much like to have it back. "
178,Joys of Omosh,Watch and learn the Omosh Dance of Joy. ,"Orokk is not crying, <name>. Soot is in eye. <Orokk wipes a tear away. >There is one last Omosh family secret Orokk will teach you. Orokk will die happy, thanks to <name>. Learn Omosh dance of joy and then you learn fist of iron! "
179,Horns of Frenzy,"Bring two Solid Iron Mauls, two Silvered Bronze Boots, and two Silvered Bronze Gauntlets to Orokk Omosh in Orgrimmar. ","The final lesson Orokk teaches you, <name>.

And the Anvil,Gather 5 Black Rook Breastplates from the elves of Black Rook Hold. ,"If you truly wish to see my work then you'll have to go and retrieve it as my shop has been raided of everything I've made.

214,A Sweet Bargain,Find a frost mage in Dalaran to chill your quenching trough. ,"Reading over this research, I found an interesting method that I'd like you to try.

342,"Careful, This Fruit Bites Back",Retrieve 8 pieces of Prickly Pear Fruit. ,"Sometimes the troops want something sweet to eat.  I don't always give them what they want but this time, I am going to make an exception.  I am sure you have seen the local cactus that grows here in Orgrimmar.  These cactus produce a tasty treat called prickly pear fruit.  The trouble is the fruit are covered in spines!  Watch your hands and bring me back a handful of that fruit. "

Gather some of the freshwater snails ambling about beneath Brightwater Lake and I'll show them what a true culinary master can create. 
351,Spice Bread Aplenty,Make or obtain 10 pieces of Spice Bread. ,"Isn't it amazing how something as simple as spice bread is used every day in Darnassus? When I'm not seeing to my other responsibilities, I like to bake spice bread to hone my skills as a cook and practice my technique. Why don't you give it a try?

These constructs now patrol the streets of Suramar City. If you were to gather some friends and defeat these constructs, you could take their cores for us to study. "
356,The Last Few,Create 2 Enchant Ring - Word of Versatility vellums for Ildine. ,"As you can see, <name>, we're hard at work producing enchants for the battle against the Legion.

","Before we can begin though, there is a small favor I need to ask of you. I'm rather ashamed about this matter, to be honest, but it must be done in order for us to work together. When I was summoned to this land, I hadn't been given a chance to collect my things. Most importantly, I left behind my enchanting rod. Instead of retrieving it I believe it would be much simpler to reconstruct it. Here's what we'll need. . . "
359,Waste Not,Go to the Crystal Fissure and search for discarded armor. ,"While fighting the ambershards for their crystals, you may come across enchanted armor from our fallen braves. The ambershards care not for such things, but our tribe does not believe in letting anything go to waste.

As I've said, I'm not strong enough to get them myself. But you are strong, I can sense it. Strong enough to take on those honor-less naga who plague my home. Find my idols and return them to me. Do this and I will grant you my mark. "
364,Strong Like the Earth,Defeat Enraged Ambershards and collect 8 of their Ambershard Crystals. ,"There are many types of spirits in this world, <name>. Some benevolent, some troubled. They all resonate with different reagents which we use to enchant our armor. One such reagent are the crystals of the ambershards. They are a violent creature born of the earth and have recently been disturbed by the drogbar. However, disturbed or not, the crystals they bear are of great use to my people for enchantments. Bring me some and I'll show you what I mean. "
365,In the Loop,Use the enchanting vellums on 6 Demon Hunters at the Illidari Stand. ,"We could use your help down here, <name>. Some of our hunters would benefit greatly from having those vellums applied to their rings right now. Here take a few. I'll give the rest to one of my other soldiers to hand out. My hunters probably won't stop to let you apply the enchants, so you'll just have to do your enchanting even if they're in the midst of battle. "
366,Ringing True,Return to Nalthanis in Dalaran. ,"While your presence here would continue to be of value to us, your master in Dalaran has called for you. I'd like to thank you again for all you've done for us. My hunters have been reminded that they're not alone in this war. "
367,Elven Enchantments,Return to Nalthanis in Dalaran. ,"You have earned the marks of my most trusted companions. You have also returned my love to me. I am fortunate to have met you, <name>. Now return to your master and let him know of what you have learned. "

Our forces can only hold back the demon invasion, disallowing us to send anyone further into the enemy's camp. The stronger of their forces stay in the back, commanding from a distance. They carry enchanted runes to keep control over the frontline demons. I would very much like to study one of these runes. Please retrieve one for me, so we may learn from it and use it against the Legion. "
369,Darkheart Thicket: The Glamour Has Faded,Kill Arch-Druid Glaidalis in the Darkheart Thicket and recover Nalamya's Book of Enchantments. ,"I once taught the night elves how to enchant their armor to strengthen themselves against the evils of this land. One elf in particular garnered my favor. Arch-Druid Glaidalis is his name. He now resides in the forest known as the Darkheart Thicket, plotting to undo this world with this awful blight.

370,An Enchanting Home,Investigate Tigrid's home in Stormheim. ,"The more I learn about the Broken Isles, the more convinced I am that it is a land of wonders! Ildine and I were just discussing rumors of a dwelling in Stormheim that was once the home to a vrykul enchantress called Tigrid.

373,Led Astray,Go to Black Rook Hold in Val'sharah and slay Trelan Shieldbreaker and Starlys Strongbow. ,"The night elves are no fools, but the elves of Black Rook follow their commanders with blind loyalty. I've no doubt that the blame for their apathy rests heavily upon their commanders. I know of two of their leaders, who as we speak continue to command their troops to do nothing against the blight encroaching upon my home. Go to Black Rook Hold and slay Trelan Shieldbreaker and Starlys Strongbow. Let them be an example for those who can help, but wish to remain cowardly. "
374,Helping the Hunters,Deliver the crate of vellums to Jace Darkweaver in Azsuna. ,"Now, while I continue to fill the rest of our orders, I'd really appreciate it if you would deliver these vellums to Jace Darkweaver down in Azsuna.

375,What the Drust Knew,Carefully remove the enchantment from the Ancient Drust relic to learn about its construction. ,"Ahoy, <name>!

If you have a moment, I could use your assistance. I've recently received a large shipment of Drust relics that I've been processing.

Most of them have been nothing out of the ordinary, but there is this one that is special. Just holding it makes my hair stand on end. 

With you being my best pupil, I was thinking that it would be fun if we disenchanted it together, to see how it was made.

What do you say? "
376,Cloaked in Tradition,Take Guron's Journal to Nalthanis in Dalaran. ,"You have seen the ways of the tauren of Thunder Totem. . . speaking with the spirits, gathering from the land, and letting nothing go to waste. These are potent forces crucial to your quest to aid the Broken Isles. Here, take this journal back to your enchanter friend. It contains the lessons I have imparted unto you. Perhaps it will serve to help the greater cause of defeating the Legion. "
377,On Azure Wings,Speak to the dragon Kharmeera at Azurewing Repose in Azsuna. ,"I have some exciting news of my own to report, <name>. Ildine and I had an excursion to Azsuna and made contact with the blue dragons at the Azurewing Repose. One of the dragons, Kharmeera, is an enchanter who expressed interest in working with you to perfect some of our enchantments. I understand you were just down there working with the elves, but if you wouldn't mind returning, Kharmeera would enjoy working with you too. "
378,Turnabout Betrayal,Defeat demons at the Felblaze Ingress. ,"Enchantress Ilanya remembers me? <The satyr pauses to wipe a tear away. >I made a fool's bargain ten millennia ago. I learned of the queen's alliance with the Legion and betrayed my heart to join their side. I was transformed into a monstrosity, only to die in battle against the mortals. Now the Legion returns, but I linger as an impotent spirit. Be my vessel and slay the demons ahead of us. Take their demonic runes and render them to dust. "
379,Sentinel's Final Duty,Slay Fathom-Commander Eksis. ,"Now that I'm stronger, it's time to test your mettle, and mine. As I mentioned earlier, there is a powerful naga I wish to kill. His name is Fathom-Commander Eksis. He was responsible for slaying many of my kin before he retreated into hiding, commanding his troops from the shadows. I've finally discovered his whereabouts in a cave just east of here. Let us bring vengeance upon him for my lost brothers and sisters. "
380,Crossroads Rendezvous,Search for signs of the priestess near the Felblaze Ingress. ,"An old apprentice of mine left during the war, shortly before we were all cursed. I've recently heard that she's been seen near the Felblaze Ingress. I would very much like to speak to her once more. Go and find her. Take her journal to her and let her know that I don't blame her for what she did. And if she's willing, please bring her back to me. "
381,Washed Clean,Meet the Fallen Priestess at the Nor'Danil Wellspring. ,"Mighty though the Legion is, theirs is not the strongest power in Azeroth. There is a place where Enchantress Ilanya and I spent many blissful hours together. The love that infuses such a place is more potent than fel magic, <name>. Go to the Nor'Danil Wellspring. Its waters can purify the fel dust you have collected. . . and perhaps purify me as well. I will meet you there. "
382,Prepping For Battle,"Craft an Enchant Cloak - Word of Strength vellum, an Enchant Ring - Word of Critical Strike vellum and an Enchant Ring - Word of Mastery vellum for Alynblaze. ","To earn my mark, <class>, you must first prove yourself in battle to me. There is a naga I wish to kill, but I am not strong enough to slay him. Before we go into battle together, I need your help as an enchanter to become stronger. I'm sure by now you have a bevy of enchantments in your repertoire. Make some for me so that I may become strong enough again to make a difference in this world. "
383,Pick Up Sticks,Collect 9 Bundles of Hard Wood. ,"In order for my enchantment to work, we'll need wood from these forests.

When I was alive, I would wander these woods and tend to the trees. While those trees are long gone, perhaps their grandseeds have heard their stories and would be willing to help me.

But don't cut down any of the trees! Please! There are loggers that cut and hew without care for the wilds. Take their hard work so that they will think twice before felling another tree.

Bring me as much wood as you can muster. "
384,No Longer Worthy,Kill night elves within the grounds of Black Rook Hold and collect their Enchanted Raven Sigils. ,"The elves of Black Rook Hold have decided to turn their backs on us. They stay inside their keep, attacking any outsider who dare try to enter. Such behavior is intolerable. . . especially after all the help they've received from my folk and the others of this land. I want you to do me a favor, <name>. Take their enchanted sigils and reduce them to dust. Bring me back the dust as proof of your deeds. "
385,Putting It All Together,Assemble the golem for Sef Iwen. ,"Hmm. . . Everything seems untouched.

We can begin construction of my new body over here. Afterwards, I'll teach you how to make my enchanting rod.

<Sef smiles at you, beaming with joy. >"

My enchantments are not lost. . .

Find me. . .

Drustvar. . .

Fallhaven. . . "
387,Fey Enchantments,Seek out Nalamya near the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah. ,"The new dusts and crystals we've found in these lands are fascinating, as I'm sure you've already surmised. I'm positive we can expand their usefulness to more of our armor. I'd like you to go back out into the field and talk to a dryad in Val'sharah. Apparently she may be able to clue us into some enchantments for shoulder pieces. Her name is Nalamya. You'll find her near the Temple of Elune. "
388,We're Going In,Activate the teleportation runes to enter Sef's Retreat. ,"This used to be a Drust shrine. There is a series of sigils that, once invoked, will allow us to teleport to my old sanctum.

<Sef looks around somewhat confused and clears her throat. >

It has been centuries since I've been here, I'm having a bit of trouble remembering the order in which the sigils need to be activated to open the portal.

I hope you're feeling adventurous. Oh, and be cautious. I enchanted the runes to keep would be intruders out by force. "
389,The Beat Goes On,Create a runic power core and charge it from the corpses of Awoken Guardians and Vengeful Bones. ,"We have most of the materials we need, but we require one final item. A heart.

Don't worry. I don't mean one of flesh, but of stone; to bind the materials of the body into a single form.

Find a smooth stone, and enchant it to hold a life force. It will require some reagents, but I would expect a powerful enchanter such as yourself to have some on hand or know where to find them.

Once that's done, it will need to be powered. The souls animating the elementals and undead here should do the trick. "
390,Exhumed,Cleanse Sef Iwen's remains. ,"As I've said, I'm unable to interact with the material world.

I am able to dominate a creature to control its body, but I find it deplorable. In essence, it is enslaving the poor creature.

What I want is a body of my own. If you build and animate a golem, it would be devoid of intelligence. A shell. One that I could inhabit without issue.

Doing so will require that my soul is not anchored to anything else in this world, so I need you to remove the spell binding my spirit to my physical remains. "
391,Enchanted Formulae,"Hey, &lt; name&gt; . ","Hey, <name>. I've got some new recipes for ya, if you're interested. "
392,What the Drust Knew,Carefully remove the enchantment from the Ancient Drust relic to learn about its construction. ,"Bal'a dash, <name>.

If you have a moment, I could use your assistance. I've recently received a shipment of Drust relics that were smuggled out of Kul Tiras.

Most have our usual enchantments, but there is one that is unique. Just holding it makes my hair stand on end. 

With you being my best pupil, I was thinking that it would be enlightening if we disenchanted it together, to see how it was made.

What do you say? "
393,The Threads That Bind,Collect 55 Durable Spider Silk. ,"Our destination is near Gol Koval, but there is something else you could pick up along the way.

I don't want to ask because I hate them, but you cannot dispute the resilience of that horrible webbing that they manage to get everywhere.

<Sef grimaces at the thought. >

There are spiders to the southeast. As a guardian of nature, I don't want to say kill them, but if you could. . . 'obtain' some fresh silk from their bodies, we could use it to bind the limbs of the golem together. "
394,The Sixth Sense,Escort Sef Iwen to her grave. ,"For my plan to work, we need to break the spell on my body that is anchoring my spirit to this place.

However, my mortal remains are buried deep within this forest. There are wards within it that are designed to trap spirits who are still attached to the material world. Once my remains are cleansed, I will be able to move freely through the woods.

Until then, I'll need you to disenchant the wards we come across.

Speak to me when you are ready, and I will lead you to my grave. "

But then we get here, and what happens? Everyone just happens to ""find"" all these ancient artifacts to fight the demons with! Long story short, I have too many guns and need to get rid of 'em. "

Swarming with demons too, I hear. I was thinking maybe we could put together another wormhole generator for it. Make it easier to zip around the planet. Problem is we need to get readings on the landscape, and I'd go, but uh. . . well I need to stay here and run the shop. Can't leave it to these bozos to handle. Here, take this and get some readings for me, will ya? "
404,Short Circuit,Find the inventor of Blingtron. ,"While I've got you here, I was wondering if you could track something down for me. I'm sure you're familiar with a Blingtron, yes?

But first, you gotta be able to suck it up, and that, my friend, requires a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor. Now, I could just give you the schematics, but I'll need something in return first.  How about some spare parts?  Last time I checked, there were plenty lying around near the broken steam pump at the Dead Mire, far to the northeast. I heard that the withered giants spread the pieces all over that dried-out lake bed. "
406,The Wrench Calls,Meet with Didi the Wrench in Dalaran. ,"<name>, Didi the Wrench is looking for you back in Dalaran. You might want to see what she's working on. Pretty fancy stuff from what I heard. "

I could give you the plans to make one, but I really need some spare parts to fix stuff 'round here. Last time I checked, there were plenty of parts lying around near the steam pump at the Dead Mire to the northeast.  I think the withered giants broke the pump out there. Shall we help each other out? "
409,Always the Last Thing,Find a suitable power source for Didi's design and deliver it to her. ,"Well, I've worked out all the kinks. Added a few nuts and bolts, and fitted a new housing for the power core. Problem is, none of the batteries I have here seem to work. I think we're gonna have to fashion somethin' new together.

412,A Harsh Mistress,Help Hobart calibrate the Prototype Gravitational Reduction Slippers around Dalaran. ,"So there I was thinkin' about how to get everyone ready for movin' around Argul or whatever it's called, since I figure its gravity is different than ours, and I come up with a design for a device you slip onto your shoes, or hooves or whatever you're wearin' down there. Next thing I hear, the gravity on that planet? Completely the same as ours! Regardless, I figure I could get the prototype workin'. Mind givin' me a hand?

565,Tharillon's Fall,"Bring 20 piles of Starlight Rosedust to Azsuna, use them to taunt Herbalist Tharillon out of hiding, then search him for information about herbalism. ","He mentions your name. . . his blade. . . aethril. . . I'd say that this is absolutely from Herbalist Tharillon, and by the look of it, he may have succumbed to the plight of the nightfallen. Furthermore, if he's looking for aethril, he's probably in Azsuna somewhere. Tharillon is currently our only hope for learning more about starlight roses. Seek him out, but you may want to bring friends. . . he likely won't go without a fight. "
566,Spayed by the Spade,Obtain a Pristine Pistil and a Stainless Stamen. ,"The stem, leaves, and petals are dazzling, to be certain. . . but look at the pollination filaments, here, and the reproductive organs in the center of the bloom. They contain more energy than the rest of the plant put together. I suspect that we can more responsibly and efficiently harvest aethril by focusing on these parts. Still, it looks like this bloom has been damaged. I need undamaged parts if I'm to be sure. "
567,Dreamleaf Sample,Bring the Dreamleaf Sample to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"The herb is brilliantly green, paper-thin, and somewhat sticky. Your herbalism trainer in Dalaran will want to see this. "
568,Chase the Culprit,"Find out what creature has been eating Foxflower, then chase it and catch 12 Chewed Foxflower Bits. ","This is a powerful herb, <name>. Creatures will occasionally snack on some simpler herbs, but usually they avoid plants of such potency. I'm intrigued. What kind of animal would eat foxflower? A moose? You should investigate further. Find out what creature has been snacking on foxflower, and then see if you can wrestle some of the flowers from its mouth, before it escapes. "
569,A Slip of the Hand,Speak with Kuhuine Tenderstride about the quick-reproducing property of aethril. ,"As you harvest the aethril, your hand brushes the flower's pollinating organs against one another, creating a reaction. You may have discovered a new herbalism technique. Your trainer in Dalaran would be a good person to discuss this with. "
570,The Last Straw,Use Tur'xoran's Summoning Stone to summon and slay Tur'xoran. ,"We cannot falter in our crusade against this corruption, <name>. It is our duty as heroes. As herbalists. As hero-balists. Slaying simple satyrs will not do. We must attack their leaders. Bring this fallen herb to Shala'nir, in the northeast. Find Tur'xoran 's summoning stone, and place this herb in front of it. Then. . . rip off his head. Do it for the plants. "
571,Desperation Breeds Ingenuity,Obtain 6 Chewed Aethril Stems from Withered in Azsuna. ,"I believe we may be able to use this clue to our advantage, <name>. The withered are notoriously thirsty for mana, and will stop at nothing to get it. Perhaps we can study how they use the aethril and use the results to improve our own harvesting methods. "
572,Choked by Nightmare,Bring the Blight-Choked Herb to Wildcrafter Osme in Val'sharah. ,"Another plant, killed by the blight. This one coiled so hard that it starved itself of sunlight. You should bring it to Wildcrafter Osme in Lorlathil. He won't be happy. "
573,Root Samples,Collect 8 Root Samples from herbs around North Barrens. ,"The herbs of the Barrens are not quite like herbs in other lands.  Their properties are mostly the same, but the oasis water here alters the plants; they are just slightly different. I want to study those differences. . . to see if they're exploitable! If you are skilled in herbalism, then gather root samples off the herbs you find in the Barrens.  Bring back these samples so that I may compare them with herbs from other regions. "
574,An Empathetic Herb,Obtain 15 Healthy Dreamleaf and 5 Blight-Infested Dreamleaf. ,"Something is different about this dreamleaf, though. It is less than pure. I have a theory. The wilds of Val'sharah have been blighted by a nightmarish curse. Sensitive herbs like this may be susceptible to such a blight. I need more information before I can draw any conclusions. Find me some healthy samples and some blight-infested samples, and we can continue. "
575,More Anchor Pods,Harvest 9 Mature Anchor Pods from anchor weed. ,"Everyone in Kul Tiras knows that anchor weed is a blight that was brought here by merchants. It thrives in this weather and it leechs nutrients from other plants, so we work to keep it from spreading, but it also has a strong magical essence, keeping us from just eradicating it. However, if it has mutated so it can disperse more seeds, we may need to finally purge it. Bring me the biggest seed pods you can find, we need to see if this is a unique case. I'll dissect this one and learn what I can. "
576,One Dead Plant is One Too Many,Slay 20 satyrs within Val'sharah. ,"We must exact VENGEANCE for this. While I understand the importance of the balance between the Emerald Dream and the Nightmare, this time it's corruption has gone TOO FAR! Satyrs. I blame the satyrs for this. Make them pay! Make them pay, and Elune will reward you with her bounty! "
577,Seeking More Knowledge,Retrieve the Treatise on Anchor Weed from within Waycrest Manor. ,"It pains me to admit that I don't know everything about plants.  I've taught you everything I know about Anchor Weed, but I think I know where you could look to learn more.

If you find yourself inside that manor, keep an eye out for a book called, ""The Treatise on Anchor Weed"".  Its author spent decades studying that forsaken weed. "
578,Twisted to Death,Find someone in Lorlathil to teach you about the blight's effects on herbs. ,The corruption has completely taken this herb. This blight is a mysterious force whose complexities transcend the teachings of simple herbalism. An expert in such infestation will need to tell you what's really going on here. 
579,Ragged Strips of Silk,Speak with Kuhuine Tenderstride about aethril and the withered. ,"Finely made strips of clothing, torn, tattered, and dirty: telltale signs of the withered. The feral, degenerate outcasts of nightborne society must also be harvesting the aethril. . . but why? "
580,The Spade's Blade,Find the Broken Herbalist's Blade. ,"Did you notice the script along the base of the handle, <name>? It says ""Herbalist Tharillon, "" in the writing of the nightborne. The handle does little for us, but perhaps the blade of this spade will give us some information on how to harvest the starlight rose without failing quite so often. I would start my search for it in Suramar. "
581,Felwort Analysis,"Collect Ryno Bloomfield's Analysis, Dani Earthtouch's Analysis, and Lohor's Analysis. ","I sent felwort samples to some of my fellow herbalists, but haven't heard back from them yet. Could you please follow up with them and collect their analyses.

582,Can't Teach on an Empty Stomach,Collect 7 Lane Snapper for Xun Xun Sweetflower. ,"I would love to teach you, but it's so hard for me to concentrate right now.  I haven't eaten anything all day, so it's all I can think about. However, if a helpful adventurer were to fish up some lane snapper from the ocean just behind me, I would owe them a something in return.  Perhaps something valuable, such as advice in regards to effectively picking the notorious winter's kiss. If you don't feel like fishing, you could just buy some on the auction house, I don't mind. "
583,Fjarnskaggl,"Bring 20 Fjarnskaggl to the Wind-Worn Cairn in Stormheim, then earn the Blessing of Fjarnskaggl. ","There! It seems that there was a vrykul herbalist, Torgus, who brought a gift of fjarnskaggl to a seaside cairn - presumably in Stormheim - and by doing so received a blessing from his ancestors. <Kuhuine shrugs. >It's worth a shot, though without knowing what you're getting into, you may want to bring friends with you. "
584,Insane Ramblings,Bring the Scribbled Ramblings to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"Scribbled, angry phrases on a dirty scrap of vellum.

586,Ram's-Horn Trowel,Bring the Ram's-Horn Trowel to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"The rune markings along the tool's grip suggest that it was left behind by a vrykul herbalist. Apparently, the vrykul are also gathering this fjarnskaggl. Your trainer, Kuhuine, mentioned that she had read about this herb in the past. Perhaps she might be interested in seeing the tools that the vrykul use to harvest it. "
587,The Pied Picker,Bring the Foxflower Scent Gland to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"As you finish gathering the foxflower, a particular part of the bloom catches your eye. One of the leaves has a small protuberance, right where it meets the stem. Further investigation suggests that this is where the foxflower's unusual smell comes from. Your herbalism trainer would be interested in seeing this. "
588,Giving Back to Nature,Plant the Akunda's Bite Sapling and defend it until it builds a static charge. ,"Perform one additional task, and I will give you the knowledge you seek. The seeds you have are strong, but they need time until they are ready to grow. However, one must always be prepared in the desert. This sapling is mature enough to live on its own, but it is frail. It needs the dry desert winds to build static so it may bite, but until it does, it is as helpless as grass. Plant it in the desert sands, near the fallen beast south of the Brine Basin, and protect it until it can defend itself. "
589,Vrykul Herblore,Find three vrykul Herbology books in Stormheim. ,"<Kuhuine studies the trowel further. >This is a standard digging tool. There is not much to be learned here, except. . . . . . this DOES suggest that the vrykul are still actively gathering this herb. The vrykul likely know much more about this herb than we do. All we need to do is find out where their knowledge is stored. "
590,Ghost Busting,Put the Angry Spirit to rest. ,"I hate to ask this of you, but are you available for some more grunt work? I'd do it myself, but this seems beyond my capabilities. Remember how I told you we use star moss to allow those no longer living to join us for a special day? Yeah, well, sometimes once they show up, they don't want to leave.  There is a spirit on the other side that is lashing out, harming those it should be protecting. Take this smoldering star moss and cleanse the area until you find the offender and help them move on. "
591,Seeking More Knowledge,Retrieve the Treatise on Anchor Weed from within Waycrest Manor. ,"One of de most sacred plants on dis island is anchor weed. Legend says dat it was a gift from de Loa and it can do anything from regrow limbs to granting immortality.

Look for it deep within the Waycrest Manor. Dey ask dat in exchange for dis knowledge, you kill whatever is causing a rift in de spirit world. "
592,Pollen Punching,Collect 12 Heaping Handfuls of Damp Pollen from siren's sting. ,"What I think happened is that some creature lapped up all the pollen with it's tongue. While I'm curious as to what creature could have done this, I doubt it matters. I believe we can safely reproduce this without needing any sort of rare or dangerous reagents. Next time you find a siren's sting, simply try wetting your glove so the pollen will stick to it. Water, wine, spit. . . It shouldn't matter. "
593,Starlight Rosedust,Bring the Starlight Rosedust to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"Despite all your training, the rose disintegrated in your hand. Your herbalism trainer in Dalaran will want to see this. "

597,Meet Sweetflower,Find Xun Xun Sweetflower in Drustvar. ,"It looks like you've become familiar with the plants around here. There's a flower that grows in the snowy parts of the continent, but I can't tell you much else about it.  Can't stand being cold. However, if you're interested in learning more, I know of someone who may be able to teach you. Her name's Xun Xun Sweetflower, and last I heard she set up shop on the outskirts of Anyport over in Drustvar.  Tread carefully, though, that area is crawling with Irontide Raiders. "
598,Here In Spirit,Harvest 10 Fresh Star Moss. ,"Hey, <name>, how would you feel about doing some legwork for a favor? We have a tradition here in Kul Tiras, that during a celebration, be it funeral, wedding, or birthday, we incorporate star moss into the decorations. We do that so those who are no longer amongst the living can be here in spirit. With the recent fighting, my stores are near empty due to the number of funerals we've had. If you bring me fresh star moss to restock my supply, I'll share a secret on how to get more from each star moss. "
599,The Missing Page,Bring the Runed Journal Page to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"<The page appears to be ripped out of a larger book.

601,Emergency Transplants,Plant 10 Riverbud Seeds in rivermud. ,"With everything that's been happening over in Drustvar, there's been a sudden surge of wildlife in the sound. Normally, I wouldn't care, but they've been eating all the riverbud! If things don't improve soon, we could try thinning their numbers so they don't consume everything, but I'll consider that the last resort. Instead, could you go plant some of these seeds to produce additional food for them? "
602,Felwort Sample,Bring the Felwort Sample to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"This herb bubbles and seethes with a foul energy. It is smooth, dry, and cool, yet somehow quite painful to touch. Your herbalism trainer in Dalaran will want to see this. "

Humor me, and I'll make it worth your while. "
604,The Frigid Boon,Harvest 10 winter's kiss without taking cold damage. ,"While harvesting this winter's bite, you managed to pluck the flower without breaking any petals, a feat you had not accomplished before. Taking a quick mental note of every detail about yourself and your surroundings, one point sticks out to you. The heat from your breath appears to have made the petals supple enough to bend instead of break.

608,An Unusual Mentor,Find Patu in Vol'dun. ,"Hey <name>, you look like you're ready to handle hostile territory. Far away in the desert of Vol'dun, on the continent of Zandalar, there grows a plant called akunda's bite. You couldn't pay me enough to go there myself, and there's almost no mention of them in any of the books I've read, but all is not lost. I know of an herbalist who lives there in the desert and studies that plant.  Find him, and I'm sure he'll be able to teach you a thing or two. Oh, and do be warned. . . He is a bit. . . eccentric. "

611,More Anchor Pods,Collect 9 Mature Anchor Pods from anchor weed. ,"I need you to bring me a handful of mature anchor pods. You see, dis seed pod is massive, but it is still just a seed pod.

If my theory is correct, den we could actually have a factual record for de future. "
612,Jeweled Spade Handle,Bring the Jeweled Spade Handle to Kuhuine Tenderstride in Dalaran. ,"An immaculately carved spade handle lies beside the rose. Apparently the spade was more beautiful than it was durable, as the blade has completely fallen off. Your herbalism trainer may be interested in seeing this. "
613,Breaking The Food Chain,Kill 15 Freshwater Snapper. ,"The extra riverbud you planted has helped, but it's not enough.  Some of the local wildlife are consuming the riverbud before they mature. The more riverbud that is eaten, the less we have for our own needs. The largest group of young riverbud consumers are the turtles. If the riverbud becomes a threatened species, we'll need to regulate harvesting it. Instead, go thin the number of the turtles in the area. Do that and I'll teach you everything I know about riverbud. "
614,Emergency Transplants,Plant 10 Riverbud Seeds in rivermud. ,"Riverbud is a precious resource for us. Not only does it have potent magical properties, but it also feeds many of de beasts we train or eat ourselves. However, de Blood Trolls have been dumping a lot of cursed blood in de rivers.

616,Youthful Resistance,Ask Funen about how to handle the younger Astral Glories. ,"<As you begin to gather the flowers, you realize that some of the younger blooms are still resistant to your approach and refuse to yield.

617,Disgustingly Damp Flower,Bring the Disgustingly Damp Flower to Declan Senal. ,"Rummaging for pollen as usual, you use the harvesting technique you learned from the bees.  However, when you pull your hand away from the flower, you find that there is no pollen on your gloves. Looking inside the swirl of petals, despite it being a mature flower, you see that there is no pollen at all within it.  Upon closer inspection you see that the flower is filled with a viscous liquid.  Could the flower have done this? While unpleasant to touch, you carefully pluck the flower to show Declan. "
618,Gathering Mementos,Search through patches of sea weed to find a memento of the lost sailor. ,"I have a task dat I can not really trust to anyone else, and I feel you could handle it with de reverence it deserves.

620,Foul Harvest,Collect 12 Digested Akunda's Bite Seeds. ,"You have traveled far to find knowledge, but you have found me instead. I am curious though, how much further you would travel for it. I will teach you, if you do something for me first. Iron sharpens iron, as they say, so too does adversity strengthen the seed. Go out and find seeds, ones that have been consumed by the wild beasts and have returned to the earth unscathed. Only those seeds will be strong enough to survive the desert sands of Vol'dun. "
621,Learn From the Best,Drink Declan's potion and allow bees to harvest your pollen. ,"You want to learn how these bees are so good at harvesting pollen, but if you show up, they'll start swarming you. What you've got is a problem that can be solved with a little alchemy.  I just so happen to have this potion that, once drunk, will turn the imbiber into a plant.

624,Breaking The Food Chain,Kill 12 Ravenous Jacunda. ,"De extra riverbud you planted has helped, but it has not been enough.  Some of de local beasts are consuming de riverbud before dey can mature. We need dese plants to germinate, or we could risk losing it entirely. The largest group of young riverbud consumers are de jacunda.

According to de journal, de earthen talks about creating green hued jewels dere. I wonder if dat's anything like de viridium we find in de ore we mine. Go and see if de shrine still stands. Hopefully, we can still make use of it. I'll continue to study de journal for more information. "
794,Atal'Dazar: Not All That Glitters. . . ,Travel to Atal'Dazar and find a replacement for the broken jewel. ,"<You reference your notes on the shrine and discover that these jewels came from a ""golden sanctuary"". Given your location, that can only mean Atal'Dazar. Perhaps you could find a replacement from that ancient city. >"
795,Mastery Of Taladite,Find the Apexis Gemcutting Construct. ,"You - you are a gemcutter, no? You have the look of it in the twitch of your knuckles, in the focus of your eyes. I've been looking for something specific out here in Tanaan. We did not find it in our excavations in Arak. . . but the Apexis did not only dwell in Arak. What I am looking for is a storied Apexis construct that specialized in cutting gems. Be on the lookout, jewelcrafter. Such a marvel could benefit the both of us. "
796,The Shrine of the Dawning,Travel to the location marked on your map and investigate the shrine in Nazmir. ,"Yea, I believe there are a few here on Zandalar. You should find dem, <name>, investigate dem. See if what dis book says is true. Dis particular shrine sounds like it might be in Nazmir.

And I've marked its location for you on your map. Loa be with you, <name>. "
797,Eyes of Nashal,Obtain 2 Eyes of Nashal. ,"Masterful shadowruby. . . a good choice. Before we can cut, though, we need gems. Here stands a giant statue of Nashal, an ancient vrykul.

799,Ruined Construct,Repair the Apexis Gemcutter Construct by inserting 1000 Apexis Crystals. ,"<It is in disrepair, but it is not broken. More than anything, the construct appears to be in need of re-energizing. ><A slot on the backside of the machine lies open, waiting to accept. . . whatever the Apexis used as a source of energy. >"
800,The Shrine of Storms,Travel to the location marked on your map and investigate the shrine in Stormsong Valley. ,"Yes, I believe there are a few here in Kul Tiras. You should visit them, <name>, investigate them. See if what this book says is true. This particular shrine he mentions sounds like it may reside near Brennadam, in Stormsong Valley. It should be fairly easy to find. If my calculations are correct, it should be just north of that town. Here are the notes on that one. And I've marked its location for you on your map. Good luck, <name>. "
801,Sun-Speckled Dunes,Go to the location on your map where you believe these gems to be and recover 8 of them. ,"<Looking at your notes, the earthen mentions coming across dunes sprinkled with orange gems. He said it reminded him of the soft sunlight in this area. Checking your notes, it appears that these dunes were located south of your current location. >"
802,Tol Dagor: Jewel of the Tides,"Speak with ""Slippery"" Salton and learn what you can about the missing centerpiece. ","<As you peer at the shrine in front of you, you can't help but revel at the construction of it. Seamlessly constructed with azure jewels placed just so in a radial pattern, collapsing towards a single point. A single, empty point. An absence you assume to be a mistake. Quickly surveying the area for something that might fit there, you find nothing. However, there appears to be a drunk here shouting at the shrine. Perhaps he might know the whereabouts of the shrine's missing piece. >"
803,The Shrine of the Sands,Travel to the location marked on your map and investigate the shrine in Vol'dun. ,"Dere are two more shrines here on Zandalar. Dis next one resides within Vol'dun, near Bonetrail Gulch. Hopefully de Faithless haven't defiled de shrine. Here are de notes on dat location. Should dat shrine also need fixing, I think your skills with jewels will probably be enough to fix it. "
804,Out With the Old,Cut 4 Natant Rubellites and replace the old ones with the new. ,"<It's clear though that time has had its way with these gems, some eroded and chipped in places. Repairing this shrine may be as simple as replacing the old gems with newer ones of the same type and cut. >"

806,Digging Through the Past,Ask Jane Hudson for her book of Primordial Races: Runes and Writings. ,"Let's see, Jane Hudson probably still has her book on ancient runes and carvings. And I believe Tal'ana has a few scrolls he picked up from Ulduar. OH! And Toopa found what appeared to be some type of codex the last time he ventured out. I remember seeing the runes on it and they bear a striking resemblance to the ones in this book. If you could convince them to uh. . . lend us those items for a bit, I believe I just might be able to create a translation for you. I won't even charge you for it! "

809,Gems of the Apexis,Find Sun-Sage Chakkis in Tanaan Jungle. ,"Commander! I've noticed you have been keeping up with your jewelcrafting, despite all of this war going on. I find that to be most admirable. I overheard some of the arakkoa discussing a gemcutting device that they believe is located within Tanaan Jungle.

812,Setting Things Right,Return to Samuel D. ,<Samuel will surely be interested to hear about your investigation into this shrine. Most assuredly the part where you had to fight your way through a prison. >
813,High Prospects,Investigate Gol Osigr for clues about the jewels that were used to construct the shrine. ,"<Checking your notes, you find that the earthen had extracted the gems from some earth elementals to the south.

814,Cracking the Surface,Go to the Windshorn Hills and gather 20 Shard of Golden Beryl. ,"<Checking your notes, the earthen mentions having prospected the jewels from a nearby mountain to the northwest.

816,A Promising Beginning,Return to Samuel D. ,"<The shrine now repaired, you find yourself eager to seek out the next shrine. Perhaps Samuel has come across more locations. >"
817,Out With the Old,Cut 4 Natant Rubellites and replace the old ones with the new. ,"<Upon inspection of the shrine, you notice something. . . familiar. The cut of the gems looks like a primitive or simple version of the way you've learned to cut rubellites.

Repairing this shrine may be as simple as replacing the old gems with newer ones of the same type and cut. >"
819,High Prospects,Investigate Gol Osigir for clues about the jewels that were used to construct the shrine. ,"<Inspecting the shrine, you realize that several of the gems embedded on its surface are cracked and need to be replaced.

829,REUSE ME,"Travel to the Reliquary Camp and ask around about the ""golden sanctuary"". ","As you peer from one gem to the next, you realize that the shrine appears to be fine, yet no power radiates from it. Pulling out your jewelcrafting tools, you begin to inspect the central gem and realize that there is in fact a flaw. A small crack near the base of it that permeates through the gem towards the back. You reference your notes on the shrine and discover that this gem came from a ""golden sanctuary"". Perhaps someone back at the Explorer's League Campsite will know what this means. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(49590))"
830,Adventuring Anxieties,Speak with Mei Francis about her barding idea. ,"<name>! I was recently talking with Mei, the mount trader, and she asked me if it was possible to make a barding that could prevent adventurers from being dismounted. I'd like you to go and discuss this idea with her further. Return to me when you're finished. Perhaps we can solve this issue together. "
831,Mounting Made Easy,Capture the Great Northern Elderhorn. ,"<name>, I'm glad you're here. I confess: I've been working on a secret project behind your back. Behold: the Stonehide Leather Harness! Now, we simply need to find a mount worthy of such a piece of art. The vrykul sing songs of a snow-white elderhorn with endless stamina. Find it, place the harness on it, and tame it. "
832,Demon Flesh,Search for a master leatherworker in Suramar. ,"Something we haven't really explored yet, <name>, are the creatures of Suramar. Specifically, the demons. Now I certainly don't praise what they are, but you can't ignore the fact that some of their creatures have especially tough hides. We could take a lesson from the demon hunters and use those hides to our advantage against the demons. I'll be damned though if I know the first thing about working with demon hide. Perhaps there's someone in Suramar who can help. . . "
833,Counterbalancing,Gather Fiendish Leather and Lightweave Cloth and use Enstraa's Tanning Oil to create 12 Purified Fiendish Leather. ,"In the past, I was able to make glorious items from the beasts of this land. But then the Legion came and wiped out all those amazing beasts. Now I'm forced to use their polluted hides to craft armor for my allies. I have, however, found a way to remove their taint. The cloth we use is made from special thread infused with Light energy. I devised an oil which when combined with the cloth purifies the leather and makes it usable. Here, take my oil and see for yourself. "
834,Moonglow Vest,"Bring 1 Embossed Leather Gloves, 5 Embossed Leather Boots and 5 Embossed Leather Cloaks to Lotherias in Darnassus. ","We in Darnassus, especially we craftsman, are quite busy.  Young adventurers are eager to test themselves in the wilderness, and are in constant need of supplies. If you can help me fill my orders of leather goods, then perhaps I can teach you an advanced leatherworking technique. "
835,Over Your Head,Craft a Rough Warhide Mask. ,"Alright, <name>, I'd like you to assist me with creating a helm. First we'll need to shave the hides, then tan them, and finally cut them into usable pieces. Follow my lead. "
836,Skin Deep,Acquire 20 Stonehide Leather and 5 Stormscales. ,"Welcome, <name>. It's an honor to be working with someone of your caliber. In order for us to begin our work together, we'll first need to collect some materials. The Broken Isles are home to many strange, exotic creatures which no doubt have interesting hides to experiment with. We'll need scales to make mail armor with as well. Go and collect some materials for us so we may begin working. "
837,Dazed of the Past,Construct a Stonehide Leather Barding. ,"Let's begin crafting this mount armor, shall we? "
838,The Necessary Materials,Gather 100 Stonehide Leather. ,"In order to make this barding, we'll need a lot of leather. And I mean a LOT of leather. I'll solidify our plans on fitting the pieces together. You go gather the leather. Once that's done, we can begin crafting. "
839,Rats! ,Go into the Underbelly and recover 3 Highmountain Leatherworking Patterns. ,"I tell you, <name>, I have the worst luck sometimes. A package recently arrived from Hrul containing leatherworking patterns, and while my back was turned, some filthy rats came in and ran off with them down into the sewers! Probably building nests with them as we speak. Please, <name>, can you go down there and see if you can retrieve any of them? "
840,Wisp-Touched Elderhide,Use the Legendary Tanner's Kit in Hrul Sharptooth's dwelling in Thunder Totem. ,"Dreadleather, with knowledge carefully reverse-engineered from ancient texts, can be worked into elderhide. It is partly a matter of advanced craftsmanship and partly a simple magic of the earth. With the ancient wisps you caught and the materials you've captured and the research I have done, I have put together a Legendary Tanner's Kit for you. Take it to the heirloom hides of Hrul Sharptooth in Thunder Totem. The wisp will help you use the kit there to create Elderhide. "
841,Well Spent Time,Tell Namha of your time with the tauren in Highmountain. ,"Your respect for our ways has earned you all the knowledge we have to teach. Go now, <name>, and spread our ways to those who fight against the legion. Perhaps it will help to turn the tide in this war for our world. "
842,Instruments of Destruction,Place the Drums of Primal Might throughout Zandalar and Kul Tiras. ,"Our work is almost finished.

These drums, while powerful, are practically useless here in port.

If you want to get the most benefit from them, you'll need to spread them out. I'd suggest one for each territory here and in Kul Tiras, to help you when you are on a quest and to keep you at your strongest when you're behind enemy lines.

Look for someplace centralized in each territory to place drums.

Once you return, I'll show you how to make the mallet needed to utilize the drums. "
843,Fel Tanning,Craft a pair of bracers for Stalriss using the tanning rack. ,"Listen, you. I'm not sure when the crazy side of me will come out again, so let's make our time together short. You want to learn how to make armor to rival the demons? Follow my instructions and you'll have an excellent grasp on the procedures. "
844,Respect for the Past,Go to the four tanning racks around Highmountain and hear their stories. ,"We record the mistakes of the past so we can learn to avoid them in the present. However, recording history is not just about preventing missteps, but also to celebrate our successes. Scattered around Highmountain at sacred locations are racks with stamped leather, much like the ones here, with stories to tell. Go to these locations, pay your respect, and learn their lessons. "
845,Wrong End of the Knife,"Kill the traitor leatherworkers, Feorias, Tallian, and Syana. ","There he is! The man that isn't there! He's. . . he's. . . Wait. . . no, I'm sorry. My thoughts, they're just all over place lately. Ever since my exile, things have been a bit fuzzier than normal. If you wish to learn from me before I completely lose my mind, then do me a favor, and kill those traitors who sided with the demons and exiled me. "
846,Battle Bonds,Talk to Serr'ah at the Magical Menagerie shop. ,"Do you like pets, <name>? I love pets. They're so cute! But what I really want is more things with which to play with them. I'm sure Serr'ah over at the Magical Menagerie has some ideas for fun toys. You should go talk to her! "
847,Prime Wardenscale,Find Celea in Azsuna and create the Wardenscale where the magic aligns. ,"I feel like it is finally time for use to create something truly remarkable. To create the armor that will set you apart from the rest, we need to make the best wardenscale. Find the nightelf, Celea, in Azsuna. She has attuned and sanctified the ground where she waits to focus the magic of our world and only there can you make what we need. Go with speed, <name>. "
848,Vestment Opportunity,Obtain a Hideshaper's Vestment. ,"While the vrykul of Northrend wore strong armor, their craftsmen always had the strongest. Go to Stormheim, search for someone who knows about leather armor, and bring their chest piece back to me. "
849,Getting the Kinks Out,Go back to Celea in Azsuna. ,"Now listen, <lad/lass>. Everything ye make can always be done better. I just haven't quite worked out the way to do it with these fancy new scales. Perhaps that ghost-like elf friend of yours can help ye. An' if she DOES know somethin', perhaps ye can relay that information back to us. It would certainly go towards making the shop more lucrative. "
850,Hounds Abound,Obtain 5 Fel Hound Corpses. ,"I'll invite him to tea. That'll show him! He'll see the leather doll and say, ""When did SHE get here? ! ""I mean. . . sorry, <name>. My mind goes to strange places. You want to know about the demons, the ones with durable hides? Before I was exiled I saw such beasts roaming our cities. Fel hounds, they are called. Slay them and bring me their corpses. We can discuss their hides afterwards. "
851,Best Served Cold,Kill Ranaris in the El'dranil Shallows. ,"My partner and I both fell victim to the fallout of the Sundering. We were betrayed and abandoned by a trusted friend. That ""friend"" has recently appeared in the ruins to the east. His name is Ranaris. Go to and take revenge for us and I will grant you some of my wisdom. "
852,Eye of Azshara: Scales of the Sea,Go to the Eye of Azshara and obtain Warlord Parjesh's Hauberk. ,"When we first met, I spoke of the naga, and the armor they're able to craft. No grander armor is worn, however, than by their top warlords. One in particular resides within the Eye of Azshara itself. His name is Warlord Parjesh, and the hauberk he wears is one of legend. Repel his forces, and obtain his armor. Do this, and I will teach you more of the Azsunian way of leatherworking. "
853,Strength of the Past,Return a scale of Deathwing to Hrul. ,"As you know, the durability of your armor is only as strong as the materials you use to make them. Long ago, the black dragon, Deathwing once inhabited this very mountain. In his quest for power, his body began to tear and he had creatures make metal scales to stitch his wounds. His natural scales fell to the ground in his lair and have been there ever since. Go retrieve a scale and bring it to me. This will take all your strength to accomplish. "
854,A Debt Paid,Go to Celea in Azsuna. ,"Now, I've never heard of a ghost sending a letter before, but I'll be damned if'n I didn't just receive one now. Celea has sent fer ye, <lad/lass>. I'd best be on me way if I were ye. Might be bad luck to keep a spirit waiting. "
855,Scales of the Earth,Obtain the Axetail Basilisk Matriarch Scales. ,"While leather armor is strong on its own, integrating scales into the design is what truly sets it apart. The type of scales you use will determine how many you'll need to fully protect the wearer. And one of the strongest type of scales are basilisk scales. A fully matured basilisk has the strongest of course. Near the village of Llothien is a basilisk den. Kill the matriarch and return her scales to me. "
856,Sheza's Prized Leather,Retrieve the Rare Hides. ,"I have a stash of extremely rare leathers, or. . . rather, I did.

I don't know how, but the Venture Company must have heard how valuable my collection was because they stole it!

And THEN they had the audacity to leave a note offering to sell it back to me for 1, 000 gold! As the ""former owner"", I'm able to ""best appreciate the value of their new acquisition. ""

The note states they'll be in the bluffs to the East until someone buys them.

However you get the skins, consider them yours. "
857,Stamped Stories,Learn from the stories of each of the tanning racks. ,"Stamped onto the leather of the tanning racks behind me are the ancient ways of our tribe's leatherworkers. They tell the stories of masters who, through perseverance - and luck, in some cases - pioneered our way of leatherworking. Read the stories and learn from them. Perhaps you'll find some insight on how to better your own methods. "
858,Scales of the Arcane,Speak with the blue dragonflight and acquire one of their scales. ,"In my experience, dragon scale has been the strongest material I've ever had the privilege of working with. It's hard, durable and very little can go a long way. I wish to work with it again, <name>. Being in this form, I'm bound to this area, unable to experience the world any longer. I've heard rumor of the blue dragonflight occupying parts of Azsuna. Perhaps you can speak with them and see if they can shed a scale or two. "
859,Black Rook Bandit,Obtain 5 pieces of Black Rook Armor. ,"I've heard rumors of a grand castle in Val'sharah that's known to house an impressive army. Surely, the armor they wear ain't made of sticks and hay. I'm willing to bet they've fashioned some mail armor at some point fer their troops and it's just sitting there, ripe for the taking. How about ye head over there and see what ye can ""borrow"" from their armory. "
860,Evolution of the Past,Obtain 5 Basilisk Hides. ,"As we make stronger armor, the creatures we battle adapt and learn to defeat us. We in turn create better armor, and they in turn learn to defeat it yet again. For centuries, my people have battled the basilisks of the mesas below. They have adapted to us as thoroughly as we have to them. Go, kill these basilisks and take from them their hides. Return them to me so I may show you how they have evolved. "
861,Leather of the Ancients,Obtain 100 pieces of Ancient Dreadleather from humanoids in Broken Shore. ,"<name>, we are going to need high quality leather to work with. Ancient Dreadleather is the best hereabouts and local tanning techniques were exceptional in the past. To the untrained eye, it may look like normal dreadleather. That is where the wisp comes in. Many of your enemies across Broken Shore will have some amount of Ancient Dreadleather.  As you defeat them, you will start to recognize armor made from it and you can harvest the leather for our purposes. "
862,Reclaimed Cargo,Obtain 5 Mail Armor Shipments. ,"The same ship that my brother was on also carried shipments of exceptional mail armor. Knowing the giants, they probably had no use for them and left them scattered around their caves. If you could recover those shipments and bring them here, I can explain the techniques used to fashion them. That should give you a good idea of how to improve your processes. "
863,Shoulder the Burden,Obtain Lohrumn's Shoulderguard. ,"During one of our recent battles, my brother, Lohrumn, was slain. His armor was taken by the drogbar. You would honor his memory by retrieving what has been stolen. I will make it worth your while, leatherworker. "
864,Drogbar Durability,Kill 15 drogbar to prove your worth to Hrul. ,"We are currently at war with a race known as the drogbar. We have long maintained peace with the drogbar, but lately, they have no respect for anyone but themselves. Slay them. Prove your worth as an ally of the tauren. Do this, and I will reward you with knowledge. "
865,Playthings,Craft a prototype for the pet bed. ,"Ok, so her ideas were a leash, a bed, and a FLAMING HOOP? ! It sounds like they want to start a circus or something. Regardless, I love all those ideas and we should get started as soon as you're ready. Why don't you work on making the bed, and I'll work out the details for the flaming hoop. "
866,From Head to Toe,Craft a pair of Sturdy Stonehide Boots. ,"You've been busy, <name>. And you have some new patterns in your repertoire, I see! How about we add another? "
867,Leather Legwork,Get a crowbar for Thanid. ,"Good news, <name>! Langrom's Leather and Links recently delivered a shipment of mail armor to me. It's of the finest quality and I'd love to show it to ye, but it seems I've lost me crowbar and can't open the crate. If ye could run over to their shop and grab an extra one fer me, we can get this crate opened and go over the construction. "
868,Testing the Metal,Escort Taldranis to safety. ,"Alright, if we're going to get out of here, we're going to have to maneuver around the naga and the sea giants. The naga probably won't pose much trouble for someone of your skill, but those sea giants are strong beyond belief. Just get me out of this cave safely and I can find my own way home. Hopefully this armor Celea made for me will protect me long enough to see this through. "
869,The Tauren Tanner,Meet the Tauren Leatherworker in the Port of Zandalar. ,"Hey, rich mon.

One of ya Tauren stopped by and asked who was de best leatherworker I knew who doesn't mind gettin' their hands dirty.

I give 'im ya name, and he asked for an introduction. Said dat he would be in de Bazaar, by de docks.

Head on down to de docks and find dis Tauren. Show 'im what I taught ya.

And focus! Needn't be havin' ya make me look bad! "
870,Claw of the Land,Obtain 100 Stalker Claws. ,"Personal experience has taught me to use stronger materials when crafting armor pieces. They last longer, and you don't need quite as many of them. For example, I utilize the claws of the pinerock stalkers. If you acquire some for me, perhaps I can show you how better materials can increase your efficiency. "
871,The Legend of the Elderhide,Capture Ancient Wisps in Val'sharah. ,"Leatherworking is one of the oldest forms of craftsmanship in the world. Hides of animals were the first clothing. Legends tell of a particular form of leather curing that has been lost to us in modern times. Combining magic of the earth with some of the finest leathers ever found, this technique has been recreated by yours truly through careful analysis and my understanding of style. To begin, you must capture some ancient wisps to channel the exact nature magic for the curing process. "
872,Naga Know-How,Obtain 7 Naga Shoulderguards. ,"The naga of this region wear little armor, but what they do wear is particularly durable. If you wish to make a strong shoulder piece, I would first study the naga's armor and then create a pattern of similar construct. The city nearby is overrun by naga. Slay them and bring me their armor and I will show you what I mean. "
873,The Aeonian Artisan,Meet the Night Elf Leatherworker in Boralus Harbor. ,"Good day, friend! A Night Elf woman stopped by and asked who was the best leatherworker I knew who didn't mind getting their hands dirty. I gave her your name, and she asked me to ask you to find her in Boralus Harbor. She didn't say what she needed my best student for, but the way she acted makes me think that it is for something big. Head on down to the docks and look for her. She has white hair, purple tattoos, and a pet turtle named ""Gouge"". Show her what I've taught you! "
874,Stormheim Savagery,Obtain 7 Vrykul Leather Bindings. ,"There's a land below - Stormheim, they call it - that's inhabited by vrykul. I remember the vrykul from my days in Northrend. What I remember most was how well-crafted their armor was. If the vrykul here are as skilled as the ones in Northrend, then I'm certain we can learn something by studying their armaments. "
875,Too Good To Pass Up,Obtain a Black Rook Hauberk. ,"All types of Black Rook Hold armor are intriguing, but I'm most interested in their chest pieces. If ye can, try to find someone of importance there and. . . relieve them of their shirt. If it makes ye feel any better, I've heard they're all cursed, so puttin' them out of their misery is the least ye could do. "
876,Time Well Spent,Tell Namha of your time with the night elves in Azsuna. ,"Unfortunately, <name>, you have learned all that I have to teach. I am pleased we were each able to achieve our goals in this partnership. Go now and share what you've learned with your allies in Dalaran. I'm sure they'd be eager to share in your training. "
877,Tauren Tanning,Report to Hrul Sharphoof. ,Have you heard of the Highmountain tauren tribes? They're not unlike the tauren we know on Kalimdor. I've heard they have a leatherworking master there who might be able to help us come up with some new patterns. Travel to Highmountain and see if they're willing to teach you how they craft their armor. 
878,The Owl and the Dreadlord,Find and restore the Legplates of Mephistroth by defeating him in the Cathedral of Eternal Night in Mythic Difficulty. ,"The demon Mephistroth is one of the most powerful of the Nathrezim--the dreadlords. I can see in your eyes that you know what I am going to ask you to do. But it is for your own good! You can't keep wandering the lands looking like you do. Most recently, Mephistroth has been dispatched by the Legion to the Cathedral of Eternal Night. No doubt, he will be wearing some legplates that I believe contain Wardenscale. Take them, shine them up, and bring them to me. "
879,The Wisp and the Shadow,Defeat the Shade of Xavius in Darkheart Thicket on Mythic Difficulty and dye his shroud. ,"<name>, have you heard of the nightmare lord, Xavius, whose shade haunts Darkheart Thicket? I have heard that this shade is sometimes seen wearing a colorless shroud. This shroud is steeped in powerful magic and the wisp will draw it out for you. If you can fight the shade, take the shroud, and use your skills to dye it, I will show you how to work wonders! "
880,The Owl and the Observer,"Kill Viz'aduum in the Return to Karazhan dungeon on Mythic difficulty, and retrieve and repair the Bracers of the First War. ","I've researched some foul creatures in my time but Viz'aduum the Watcher may top the list. I mean, he is a giant, disgusting, dangerous eyeball! Currently he haunts Karazhan--do you know the place? In Medivh's time, much of our common knowledge was stored there. Alas, the time has passed. . . I digress. Viz'aduum is in possession of armor from the First War--bracers to be specific--and they are incredibly valuable. It pains me but take them, repair them, and then we must use their wardenscale. "
881,A Daring Rescue,"Find Taldranis in Oceanus Cove, and deliver the armor to him. ","My brother, Taldranis, was on a ship headed here to Azsuna. The ship was ambushed by the sea giants and my brother was taken captive. I believe he still lives out his days in those horrible caves, slaving away for the giants. Go and free him, please. Take this with you, it may give him enough protection should you run into any trouble. And be careful not to get captured by the giants yourself. "
882,Hardening the Hide,Return to Highmountain and talk to Hrul Sharphoof. ,"Back to Highmountain for you, <name>! I hear they know even more efficient ways to craft our patterns. When you get there, put in a good word for me, will ya? I'd like to start a relationship the tauren, so I don't have to keep sending you back and forth. "
883,Leather Lady,Meet with Diane Cannings. ,"I'd like you to start working with my apprentices. The first is Diane Cannings, who has focused her expertise on the softer leather armors. She's just not that into mail armor, like the twins are. Go talk to her about this new type of leather. "
884,Make Some Noise,Craft 6 Drums of Primal Might. ,"We have everything we need to craft the drum, except Elune's blessing. The drum is but a vessel, like a cup. We need her to imbue the drum with power, filling the cup so that we may drink. With Tyrande donning the mantle of the Night Warrior, much of Elune's power is taxed. Asking for another favor is not insignificant, but I must try. While I'm doing that, I need you to craft the drum. Try to keep it small. The larger the vessel, the more power it can hold, but the harder it becomes to move. "
885,The Final Lessons,Go to Hrul Sharphoof in Highmountain. ,"<name>, Hrul has requested your presence. From his message it seems as though he's ready to impart to you all the wisdom he has gained from working with the skins of this land. I envy you, <name>. . . but I'm also proud to see that you've gained so much respect with him. Go now, and good luck! "
886,Battle Bonds,Talk to Lio the Lioness at the Magical Menagerie shop. ,"Do you like pets, <name>? I love pets. They're so cute! But what I really want is more things with which to play with them. I'm sure Lio over at the Magical Menagerie has some ideas for fun toys. You should go talk to her! "
887,Instruments of Destruction,Place the Drums of Primal Might throughout Zandalar and Kul Tiras. ,"There is one last thing we need to do.

These drums, while powerful, are practically useless here in town.

If you want to get the most benefit from them, you'll need to spread them out. I'd suggest one for each territory here and in Zandalar, to help you when you are on a quest and to keep you at your strongest when you're behind enemy lines.

Look for someplace centralized in each territory to place drums.

Once you return, I'll show you how to make the mallet needed to utilize the drums. "
888,The Audition,Craft 3 Drums of the Maelstrom and bring them to Atikka Moonchaser. ,"Xanjo has spoken highly of your skills, but I need to be certain of what you can do. I mean no offense, this is as much for your benefit as it is our own, as if you are not ready the task could kill you.

If you are willing, I would like to provide you with a test to see how well you can work leather.

Bring me three Drums of the Maelstrom that you have crafted yourself. This will prove your skill and consistency.

If your work is up to par, I will inform you of my plan. "
889,The Legend of the Wardenscale,Capture the Father of Owls on the Isle of the Watchers. ,"One of my favorite legends is of the Father of Owls on Isle of the Watchers. It is said that his spirit comes to comfort his creatures during times of trouble. With the Legion's arrival on the Isle of Watchers, many of the owls are being slain so you can find him there. We need to ""borrow"" him for a short time as he has seen many of the battles where famous warriors and villains have worn armor made of Wardenscale. With his spirit, you can identify items we can extract it from and use it for style! "
890,Make Some Noise,Craft 6 Drums of Primal Might. ,"We have everything we need to craft the drum, except the Earth Mother's blessing. 

The drum is but a vessel, like a cup. We need her to imbue the drum with power, filling the cup so that we may drink.

It will not be easy to convince her to assist us in creating a weapon of war, but I will implore her to protect her children.

While I'm doing that, you will need to craft the drum itself.

Not too big, though. The larger the vessel, the more power it can hold, but the harder it becomes to carry. "
891,Links in the Chain,Find a leatherworking master in Azsuna. ,"Well, <lad/lass>, I'm afraid I'm at me wits' end with these scales. Not quite sure how to fashion the remaining pieces fer a full set. However, I've heard that the elves of Azsuna had some great crafters in their cities. Perhaps one or two of them still exist. Go there and search fer a master. Maybe they can fill in the missing patterns fer us. "
892,Mail Men,Meet with Thanid Glowergold. ,"The two dwarves behind me are the Glowergold brothers. They're my resident mail armor experts. While Ranid has decided to focus his skills towards lining his pockets, his brother, Thanid, still enjoys the crafting side of the trade. Introduce yourself to Thanid. You may work with him to further our knowledge of turning these stormscales into something extraordinary. "
893,The Wisp and the Nightmare,Get the spellsash from Xavius in the Emerald Nightmare and repair it. ,"Xavius, the Nightmare Lord in Val'Sharah, derives some of his power from his spellsash. It is enchanted and tied to the world beneath his feet and cannot be removed from his body. However, with the ancient wisp's help, the spellsash can be removed if you can but defeat Xavius in combat. Trivial for one of your skill, I'm sure. Take the wisp to the Emerald Nightmare, take the spellsash, and use your skills to repair any damage you've caused in the battle. "
894,Telonis' Prized Leather,Retrieve the Rare Hides. ,"I have a stash of extremely rare leathers, or. . . rather, I did. A group of thieves must have heard how valuable my collection was because they stole it! And THEN they had the audacity to leave a note offering to sell it back to me! As the ""former owner"", I'm able to ""best appreciate the value of their new acquisition. ""The note states they'll be waiting in the foothills behind the castle, to the east, until they find another buyer. However you get the skins, consider them yours. "
895,The Owl and the Traitor,Find and repair Cordana Felsong's Mantle in the Vault of the Wardens in Mythic difficulty. ,I've scoured the tales and legends for armor that might have Wardenscale components and one Cordana Felsong is a name that caught my attention. Evidently she has a family mantle that has what we need. Kill her and find it on her traitor's corpse. The owl will make sure that you spot it. It is likely chipped from years of hard use so restore it to prime condition and bring it back to me. 
896,The Wisp and the Sea,"Retrieve the Waterlogged Handmaiden's Gloves from the Wrath of Azshara on Mythic Difficulty, then treat them. ","Queen Azshara and her handmaidens are the subjects of many a tragic tale. Her power and her hubris lead her badly astray but, even so, her handmaidens are loyal to her to this day. There is power in such a thing. The Wrath of Azshara is an abomination but, truthfully, it is actually one of her handmaidens who willing gave her life to protect her queen. Few know this. The Ancient Wisp knows this truth and if you take it to battle the Wrath of Azshara, you may find the handmaiden's gloves. Restore them. "
897,Picking Bones,Collect 18 Unwaning Bones. ,"When I was sailing in, I noticed the remains of an unbelievably large beast on the nearby peninsula.

Whatever it was, it must have been strong, making it the perfect source for the bone elements of the drums.

Go to the peninsula, 'Xibala' I've heard it called, and fill a bag with the bones you find.

If you come across any of those damned Alliance, show them no mercy. They did this to themselves. "
898,Mail of the Ancients,Obtain 100 Ancient Gravenscale from humanoids in Broken Shore. ,There is some wardenscale scattered here and there in the Broken Isles. Various enemies and local monsters seeking to ape the superior races like ourselves will have picked it up and worn it. The kind we need is amongst the oldest ever made. It is ancient gravenscale. Keep all that you find and and bring it to me. We will harvest what useful bits we can from it. 
899,Repaying the Debt,Speak with Telonis in Stormwind. ,"I was in Teldrassil when it was set alight. Through the panic and chaos, I knew I could not rest as long as those who did this were unpunished. I need you to go to Stormwind, find Telonis near the Lion's Rest, and ask for some of his personal collection. I managed to save him from the fires, so he owes me a great deal. I would go myself, but the loss of Teldrassil is still a fresh wound. I still need to give it time to heal. Find him, tell him I sent you, and that this will absolve his debt to me. "
900,Picking Bones,Collect 18 Unwaning Bones. ,"When I was sailing in, I heard some of the sailors talking about the Horde presence here in Tiragarde Sound. Apparently they're scrounging around the remains of a massive creature that has washed ashore. Whatever it was, if the Horde wants it, we need to make sure they don't get it. Find the Horde, keep them from taking anything, and see if there are any bones from the creature we can use for our drums. Show them no mercy, <name>. "
901,The Audition,Craft 3 Drums of the Maelstrom and bring them to Daniss Ghostdancer. ,"Cassandra has spoken highly of your skills, but I need to be certain of what you can do. I mean no offense, this is as much for your benefit as it is our own, as if you are not ready the task could kill you. If you are willing, I would like provide you with a test to see how well you can work leather. Bring me three Drums of the Maelstrom that you have crafted yourself. This will prove your skill and consistency. If your work is up to par, I will inform you of my plan. "
902,Leathered Patterns,"Hey, &lt; name&gt; . ","Hey, <name>. I've got some new recipes for ya, if you're interested. "
903,Bass Fishing,Collect Brilliant Golden Scales. ,"Have you heard of people taking small golden carp as pets?

Well, if it is kept in a pond free of predators, over time it can grow enormous, only limited by the food present.

Centuries ago, one of these fish lived in the pond atop a mountain. It ate everything and began to starve, so my people dug a river that connected the pond to the ocean so the fish could be free.

Now, fishermen talk of being attacked by an enormous golden fish in the Rockaway Shelf.

Kill it. Take his scales back to Atikka. "
904,The Other Ghostdancer,Speak with Mevris Ghostdancer in Val'sharah. ,"When the Legion was attacking, my partner went to Val'sharah to fight the demons. Mevris may be cold and headstrong, but he's goal oriented, and willing to sacrifice to achieve them. That's part of why I fell in love with him. If there is anyone who would know where we could get the raw materials for something of this magnitude, it would be him. Head to Val'sharah, and look for him in the Temple of Elune. Tell him of our plan, and that we need his help securing scales. "
905,Mevris' Menace,Collect Brilliant Azure Scales. ,"There is a hydra that has been something of a nuisance for us as of late. It lives out on the Gloaming Reef, almost directly due west of here. It's been attacking ships that pass by, making it difficult to get supplies to and from Bradensbrook. I sent a team to handle it, but they haven't returned. Go out there, kill it, and take its scales to Daniss. And when you see her, tell her that I said. . . <Mevris pauses as he thinks of his words, and the meaning they carry. >Nothing. "
906,Leathered Patterns,"Hey, &lt; name&gt; . ","Hey, <name>. I've got some new patterns for ya, if you're interested. "
907,Dropping by the Base,Speak with Torv Dubstomp in Thunder Totem. ,"When the Legion was attacking, I met with a member of the Highmountain Tauren who had a knack for making and playing drums.

Torv usually keeps to himself, but he is as brilliant as he is insane.

If there is anyone who would know where we could get the raw materials for something of this magnitude, it would be him.

Head to Thunder Totem, and ask Torv Dubstomp if he can think of a suitable source of scales. Preferably something still living, so its power is still fresh. "
908,Repaying the Life Debt,Speak with Sheza Wildmane in Thunder Bluff. ,"When I heard that the Alliance attacked Dazar'alor, I couldn't help but think of those lost when they attacked Camp Taurajo. No longer can I sit idly while they continue to slaughter us!

I need you to go to Thunder Bluff, find Sheza Wildmane on the Elder Rise, and ask for some of her personal collection.

I won't go into detail, but she owes me a life debt, and seeing her would. . . bring back too many painful memories. . . for both of us.

Find her, tell her I sent you, and that this absolves her debt. "
909,Ritualistic Preparations,"Mine Unsanctified Storm Silver Ore, use a forge to smelt Unsanctified Storm Silver Ingots, then get them blessed by a tidesage. ","Hey! I just got a request for a shipment of storm silver. Wanna help? As you know, storm silver is lightweight and resists corrosion. What you may not know is that we use it throughout our ships. It's so light our marines and pirates use it for armor because they can swim in it! However, any parts that go onto a ship have to be blessed by a tidesage, or it'll be cursed to a watery doom! Harvest a bucketful of ore, smelt it, and get it blessed for me, and I will teach you how to mine it easier. "
910,Living Felslate Sample,Bring the Living Felslate Sample to Mama Diggs in Dalaran. ,"Your miner's instinct is kicking in. Chunks of the infernal's corpse appear to be usable. Still, there must be a way to extract more ore from the demon's body. Perhaps your mining trainer in Dalaran will know how. "
911,Ritualistic Preparations,"Mine Unsanctified Storm Silver Ore, smelt it into Unsanctified Storm Silver Bars, and get them blessed by Wavesinger De'zan. ","I have received a request for a shipment of storm silver. It is a fine metal, lightweight and resistant to corrosion. We use it althroughout our ships. It is so strong even de naga use it in some of their weapons! However, any parts that go into de ship have to be blessed by a wavesinger. I can not be bothered with dat nonsense. I do not believe it needs these extra blessings, but what do I know? Harvest a bucketful of ore and get it blessed for me, and I will teach you how to mine it easier. "
912,Rethu's Sacrifice,Report your encounter to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain. ,"Miner. . . speak with me a moment. I haven't much time in this place. I see you fight for your ore. I believe that is the most noble way to obtain your stone. It gives the land a fighting chance. Still, one mustn't be callous with their own life. Dig too deep, and the land will overcome you. No stone is worth the price I paid. But that is a tale for another day. . . "
913,Darkheart Thicket: Nal'ryssa's Sisters,Go to the Darkheart Thicket and find Lyrelle's Signet Ring. ,"I was not the only miner in my family. I was the youngest of four sisters. I say ""was"" because the other three are gone. Two of them went too far. They overloaded their bodies with felslate and succumbed to the will of Sargeras. They are more demon than elf, now. The third, I have not heard from in quite some time. The last I heard, she was investigating the Darkheart Thicket. I fear she may have fallen, too - one way or the other. "
914,Living Leystone Sample,Bring the Living Leystone Sample to Mama Diggs in Dalaran. ,"This is no normal leystone. It is much livelier, shimmering in complex, enthralling patterns. It is easy to stare at. Your trainer in Dalaran would certainly like to have a look at this. "
915,The Legend of Rethu Ironhorn,Speak with Ronos Ironhorn to learn the tale of Rethu Ironhorn. ,"A long, long time ago, a tauren by the name of Rethu entered this land. His exploits paved the road that all miners walk. If you wish to learn more about mining, you must first learn about Rethu. "
916,An Ore for an Eye,Collect 20 Platinum Nuggets. ,"I have one last request before I can go. I wish to see de sunset one last time. I have an enchantment in mind, and I have all the materials I need except de metal. I need you to bring me twenty platinum nuggets. I have asked de spirits to bring me de ore, but dey do not listen to me anymore. Dat is why I hid de map where only someone who could be of help would find it. If you help me out, I will teach you what I can about mining platinum. "
917,Infernal Brimstone Analysis,"Collect the reports from Mama Diggs' apprentices in Icecrown, Deepholm and Twilight Highlands. ","In order to mine Infernal Brimstone, we first need to understand the way in which ore comes into being. I currently have three of my apprentices doing research on different ores around the world. Find Forinn Stoneheart in Deepholm, Rhol Landers in Twilight Highlands and Krul Rockhorn in Icecrown and collect any information they've gathered on the ore at those locations. "
918,Lyrelle,Summon and defeat Lyrelle. ,"Look at you, miner. Still held back by the limitations of your fragile, decaying flesh. To truly become one with the demon-tinged rocks of these lands, you must shed your skin and submit to a darker power. Join us, miner. Bring your feeble body to Felsoul Hold, and speak my name: Lyrelle. "
919,The Highmountain Tauren,Report to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain. ,"Ye've brought me a bit of interesting rocks to look at, <name>. I've got a special assignment for ye, if ye're up for it. I hear stories about these tauren, up in Highmountain, who claim mastery over minin'. I don't know if they're as talented as you or me, but they've been minin' leystone longer. Pay 'em a visit. See what they have to say. "
920,A Need For Coal,Collect 9 handfuls of Ashvane Coal. ,"Ah! <name>! Just the person I was hoping to see! I was just getting ready to smelt some monelite down into ingots, but I noticed my coal supply was running low. Well, I mean. . . I have coal, yes, but I prefer using Ashvane Coal. It puts out less smoke and burns hotter, so I need less of it. If you can  get some Ashvane Coal from the Ashvane Foundry south of here, I'd be more than willing to give you a couple pointers for mining monelite. Deal? "
921,Three Sheets to the Wind,Bring Franklin The Drunk a drink he likes to learn his mining secrets. ,"Hey, <name>.  Now isn't a great time for me. If you're interested in learning, you could talk to Franklin, my old apprentice. He used to be a damn fine miner, but now he's just a washed up drunk. You can find him asleep on the docks. I don't remember what he drinks, but if you bring him something he's sure to at least try it. He'll talk if he likes it. Talk to Harold Atkey, the bartender, he's sells a variety of drinks, I'm sure one of them is his choice. "
922,Ondri,Summon and defeat Ondri. ,"You are nothing compared to me. You think yourself hardened, experienced. . . heroic, even. Hah! You have no idea what I've been through. The tortures I've endured, the sacrifices I've made. All for the sake of my trade! Yes, I'm a miner, just like you. Want to learn what I have to teach? Come to the Crimson Thicket in Suramar, and speak my name: Ondri. "
923,Rethu's Experience,Report your encounter to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain. ,Miner. . . you. . . you know who I am? I see. That is good. My tribe continues to honor its roots. If you return to the land of the Ironhorn tribe. . . let them know that they are looked upon with pride. 
924,Three Sheets to the Wind,Bring Biru The Drunk a drink he likes to learn his mining secrets. ,"You want to know more about storm silver? Fine, if you are mining from a seam and make a mistake, you can make a deadly cloud of powderized metal. Now go. <After a moment Secott's face softens. >I am very busy, but if you insist on not dying, you should talk to my former apprentice, Biru. He is a drunk at Spirits Be With You, but he has some knowledge. Talk to Ximo, de Innkeeper, and buy him a drink. If he likes it, he'll talk, if not. . . well, I hope you have enough coin for more drinks. "
925,A Shred of Your Humanity,Allow Felsmith Nal'ryssa to place three shards of felslate in your body. ,"To mine for felslate is to seek the very blood of demons. To improve at it, you must become part demon yourself. Why the dirty look? You said it yourself: you're willing to make sacrifices. Luckily for you, I'm an expert in this area. I won't put you in any danger, as long as you trust me. Are you ready? "
926,A More Challenging Career,Collect 20 Platinum Nuggets. ,"As ye can imagine, piratin' be in me blood. Spent many of the best years of me life lootin' and plunderin'. Me favorite part was when takin' a chest filled ta the brim with gold and jewels, and buryin' it where only ye know. Alas, that life be too chaotic for me nowadays. Swashbucklin' makes me tired, and grog makes me sick. But. . . I can still bury me treasure. Bring me some booty worth buryin', and I'll teach ya everythin' I've learned about minin' over the years. So, wanna be me scallywag? "
927,Lending a Hand,Retrieve Secott's Rings. ,"If you are looking for some work, I have something you can do. I went mining recently and a diemetradon managed to bite off my hand before I could get away from it. I do not care about the hand, I have already regenerated dat, but I did lose a couple rings dat I made. If you go get them back, I will show you how to harvest more monelite from a seam. Or not. I do not care, but if you were looking for a chance to finally impress me, dis could be it. "
928,Felslate Seam Sample,Bring the Felslate Seam Sample to Mama Diggs in Dalaran. ,"This ore is remarkably heavy. More disturbingly, it seems to darken and hiss at your touch. Perhaps your mining trainer in Dalaran has some insights. "
929,Lumbering Away,Collect 9 Pieces of Dry Firewood. ,"The hardwoods in dis jungle are dense enough dat dey rival coal in terms of how much heat a skilled miner can get out of dem. The biggest problem using local timbers, however, is dat de jungle is always wet. If de wood is not stored properly, it takes weeks to dry out entirely. I bring dis up because my forge is starting to run low on fuel. Bring me some dry firewood to keep it going, and in exchange I will teach you a trick for mining monelite. "
930,Rin'thissa,Summon and defeat Rin'thissa. ,"My sister Nal'ryssa has her claws in you, doesn't she? That weakling doesn't know the first thing about mining. She was always too afraid to take the leap. True knowledge comes only from the Great One, the God of Fel and Flame. You want to truly learn how to mine? Come to Suramar's northwestern corner, and speak my name: Rin'thissa. "
931,Rin'thissa's Eye,Bring the Ore-Bound Eye to Felsmith Nal'ryssa in Suramar. ,Oddly enveloped within the felslate deposit is a humanoid eye. It quivers with life. You get the sense that it would blink at you if it had an eyelid. A mining expert should take a look at this. 
932,Rethu's Lesson,Report your encounter to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain. ,"You. . . miner. . . let me see your pick a moment. <The tauren spirit eyes your mining equipment. >You remind me of myself, when I once walked this land. Savor these moments, miner. They cannot last forever. <With a bow, the spirit disappears. >"
933,Ondri's Still-Beating Heart,Bring the Ore-Choked Heart to Felsmith Nal'ryssa in Suramar. ,"What at first looked like another chunk of felslate is, in fact, a humanoid heart, encrusted in rock and filled not with blood but a vile, demonic substance. It does not appear to belong to the beast you carved it out of. . . it seems that the infernal was holding it like a keepsake. Luckily your mining pick didn't hit it straight on. Felsmith Nal'ryssa will want to see this. "
934,Where Respect is Due,Mine for leystone 35 times while using Ronos's Glass Pick. ,"Leystone is a sensitive ore. Our smiths can coax great power out of it, but as miners, we must treat it with respect, or else its power will retreat inward. <The tauren hands you what appears to be a GLASS mining pick. >The next time you mine some leystone ore, use this pick. It will break if you strike too hard. THIS is the respect that leystone requires. "
935,Empyrium Deposit Chunk,Find someone on the Vindicaar who might be able to train you on how to mine an empyrium deposit. ,"<As you swing your pickaxe into the ore, it hits with a resounding thud, sending a small chunk of it to the ground. At this rate, it would take you all day to get a sufficient amount of ore from this deposit. ><Perhaps someone can give you some insight into how to mine this deposit properly. >"
936,Spiderphobia,Kill 8 Enthralled Mossfangs and 15 Mossfang Egg. ,"You're no stranger to monster fighting, right? The other day I found a spider just outside my house. Nothing out of the ordinary, except it was the SIZE OF A HORSE! Twenty-five minutes of screaming and pick-axeing later and I had managed to kill it. I spoke with one of the guards, and he said that there was a huge nest of them just over the hill to the northwest. If you can slay them or whatever you do, I'll teach you a secret to mining monelite. Otherwise, I'm going to have to move. "
937,Precision Perfected,Speak with Khamir and see if there's an even better way to mine empyrium deposits. ,"<While you've learned to extract as much of the deposit as you can, the core of the deposit is always left unusable. Looking closely, you can see where your strikes were causing fractures in its structure. ><One more lesson from Khamir might be needed to correct this problem. >"
938,Rethu's Journal,Bring the Torn Journal Page to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain. ,"Tucked in between a few pieces of rubble, a scrap of paper catches your eye. Mining carefully, you uncover the tattered remains of an old scroll. The tauren handwriting is archaic, but one word catches your eye: ""Rethu"". "
939,Rethu's Horn,Bring the Chunk of Horn to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain. ,"The corpse of the rocky beast yielded an unusual treasure: a battered chunk of tauren's horn. It is clearly very, very old, but something about its color and curve reminds you of Ronos Ironhorn at the Ironhorn Enclave. "
940,The Wrath of Grapes,"Bring a Jar of Pickle Juice, a Mountain of Bacon, a Pile of Sausages, and a Hillock of Eggs to Franklin The Drunk. ","You look familiar. Do you owe me money? Wait. . . no, that's not it. If you are here to learn, I could show you my secret mining technique, bu- Ugh. . . I'm a little busy trying to see straight right now. Ugh. . . it feels like someone is swinging a pick at my skull. The best cure for a hangover is pickle juice, a big greasy breakfast, and whatever I did not finish last night. Tell you what, get me those things, preferably quickly and quietly, and I will teach you whatever ya want. "
941,Don't Pick a Fight,Retrieve Myra's Favorite Mining Pick. ,"Hey, you're not busy, right? I could use your help. Ya see, I was out mining in Stormsong Valley, when this huge, two-headed monstrosity started chasing after me! I ran away, but I was back in Boralus when I realized I dropped my favorite mining pick! I know this may sound stupid, but if you could get it back for me I'd be grateful. You don't need to do something crazy, like fight them. Instead, sneak by them and grab it. I'll show you a trick to mining monelite seams for your troubles. "
942,Lyrelle's Right Arm,Bring the Severed Arm to Felsmith Nal'ryssa in Suramar. ,"You blink and rub your eyes, but they do not deceive you. This is a woman's arm, completely enveloped within a felslate seam. The arm is bloodless, but still twitches. Fel-colored streaks remain where veins once were. Felsmith Nal'ryssa will certainly want to see this. "
943,The Felsmiths,Report to Felsmith Nal'ryssa in Suramar. ,"Ye have a knack with this felslate, <lad/lass>. Best ship ye off to someone who knows the stuff better than I. The Illidari have a knack with all things demonic, really, and I've heard about a few miners who've set up shop out near the demons in Suramar. Pay 'em a visit. See what they have to teach ye. "
944,Empyrium Seam Chunk,Find someone at the Vindicaar who might be able to train you on how to mine empyrium seams. ,"<At first you thought the ore to have a mirrored surface, reflecting the starry space above you. After breaking off a chunk, you realize that the ore itself has a starry quality all of its own. ><Perhaps someone back at the Vindicaar can give you some insight on how to better extract these seams more efficiently. >"
945,Rethu's Pick,Bring the Battered Mining Pick to Ronos Ironhorn in Highmountain. ,"This seam has been mined before - it bears the telltale diagonal ruts of a miner's pick.

959,Don't Just Pick At It,Speak with Khamir about a way to extract more ore from empyrium seams. ,"<Even though you've learned to expose the ore, large chunks of it still seem to be embedded in the surrounding rock.

967,The Brimstone's Secret,Tell Mama Diggs what you learned from Matthew. ,"While you were gathering what I asked of you, I did a little testing on the brimstone. It reacted rather violently when I channeled onto it. Careful casting went into making the creature from whom you took this.

968,The Wrath of Grapes,"Bring a Jar of Pickle Juice, a Mountain of Bacon, a Pile of Sausages, and a Hillock of Eggs to Biru The Drunk. ","You look familiar. Do you owe me money?

That said, I need you to bring me saurolisk leather, enough to circle a very wide lord. For your efforts, I'll look at the skins and see if I can give you pointers on how to harvest more. "
1025,Turtle Soup,Loot 5 Sulphur Speckled Skins from Enriched Rockshells. ,"I cannot believe that I'm constantly stuck in this city! You'd help me out, right? You see, I've heard about these turtles that have been living in hot springs. What makes it interesting is that some of the sulphur from the water has soaked into their scales to give them interesting patterns. I'm too busy to go check myself, but if you could go get me some of their skins, I'd be more than willing to teach you everything else I know about skinning anything with scales in exchange. "
1026,Atal'Dazar: An Unbreakable Bone Needle,Travel to Atal'Dazar and collect Rezan's Bone Fragment. ,"Hey, <name>, lookin' for work? I've heard through Alliance Intelligence that the trolls have a dead god or something similar. 'Rezan' I think was the name, over in Atal'Dazar. After the last time I broke a bone needle, I can't help but think that one made from the bone of a god has got to be indestructible, right? I want you to retrieve one of his bones. Or at least something big enough that I can carve an eye in and use. In return, I'll show you everything that I know about harvesting bones. "
1027,Brinepinch,"Kill Brinepinch, and bring its ""head"" to Camilla Darksky. ","You! <name>! I have a business proposition for you. There is a monstrous crab nesting in some of my favorite hunting grounds. I've already been forced out of some areas because of the sirens, I'm not about to lose more to a CRAB! Bring me the head of Brinepinch! In return I'll teach you how to get more leather when skinning. <Camilla pauses for a second before clarifying her thought. >Sorry, most creatures that wrong me have heads. Just bring me some part of it as proof of its death. "
1028,The Problem with Shrinkage,Ask Rolm about the shriveled leather hide. ,"<Having skinned countless creatures, you can't help but notice how much usable leather is lost when the skin is dried and tanned. The Unshackled seem to have a solid understanding of using the material, perhaps Rolm could share some of his insights. >"
1029,Bone Needle,Collect an Immaculate Quill. ,"<You see Camilla sucking blood from a wound on her hand. >Hey, can you do me a favor? I was sewing shut a battle wound in this skin, when my last bone needle broke, and now I need to get a new one. I've seen quilrats on the coast of Drustvar, one of their spines should do the trick. Bring me one in perfect condition, and I'll teach you how to harvest more bones when skinning. <Camilla looks at her hand. >Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go see a healer before this gets infected. "
1030,Hexoskeleton,Collect an Unbroken Makrura Carapace. ,"I have a bet going with Xanjo over what leather is de best for armor in regards to resisting piercing and slashing attacks. He says scales are the best, but I have something better in mind. I feel de makrura's exoskeleton could be treated to act as a natural plate armor. Bring me de carapace of a bittertide makrura, and I will teach you how to harvest bones more effectively from creatures you're skinning. "
1031,The Problem with Shrinkage,Ask Instructor Ulooaka about the shriveled leather hide. ,"<Having skinned countless creatures, you can't help but notice how much usable leather is lost when the skin is dried and tanned. The Ankoan seem to have mastered using the material, perhaps Instructor Ulooaka could share some of his insights. >"
1032,A Thicker Thread,Loot 5 Strands of Thick Webbing from Jungleweb Crawlers in Vol'Dun. ,"<name>! I was hoping you would show up! Xanjo is nearly finished with de suit of ceremonial armor he has been working on, but dere is a problem. He says dat de thread he used is too thin, and dat de weight of de leather is ripping out de stitching. He asked me to get something dat will hold, and de best thing I can think of is de thick webbing of jungleweb crawlers. You can find dem in northern Vol'dun. Bring me back some strands of their thick webbing, and my knowledge of scales is yours. "
1033,Hanging by a Thread,Ask Instructor Ulooaka about the deteriorating cragscales. ,"<As you peel the hide from the creature's body, you notice numerous scales break off the skin, tearing holes that render portions of the hide useless. The Ankoan seem to have mastered using the material, perhaps Instructor Ulooaka could share some of his insights. >"
1034,Hanging by a Thread,Ask Rolm about the deteriorating cragscales. ,"<As you peel the hide from the creature's body, you notice numerous scales break off the skin, tearing holes that render portions of the hide useless. The Unshackled seem to have mastered using the material, perhaps Rolm could share some of his insights. >"
1035,Inspire Me! ,"Craft a Brown Linen Robe, a White Woolen Dress, a Simple Black Dress, a Frostwoven Robe, and a Spiritmend Robe while standing near Leyweaver Mithrogane. ","I am, and always will be, a student of robemaking and dressmaking. You can keep your gloves, belts, and cloaks. Nothing beats a good robe. I'll share my pattern for an imbued silkweave robe with you if you can teach me some of the robe and dress patterns you've learned along your tailoring journey. "
1036,A Stitch in Time,Assist Delormi in repairing the Tears in Time. ,"Hm. . . I don't know that I've ever been to this time, before.

I suppose I should explain myself. My name is Delormi, and I'm the last remaining member of the Synchronous Tailors.

We make sure the fabric of time stays, well, mended. But I've found a number of new tears cropping up.

In fact, I believe that's why I've arrived here in this time. Perhaps you could assist me in tracking them down and repairing them? "
1037,Return to Karazhan: The Big Bag Theory,Recover a Bag of a Thousand Pockets and a Fel Sinew Bag from Karazhan. ,"I'm sure you've heard, <name>, that a bigger bag is always better. I disagree. I believe it's the quality of the bag that makes all the difference. Just look at those tattered things around your person. They make you look. . . well, quite plain. I'll prove it to you. Allegedly there are some bags in Karazhan that hold an almost infinite amount of items, but the materials required to make such bags are. . . well, you'll see. "
1038,The Queen's Grace Loom,"Use the Teleportation Crystal in the Leyweavers' Hall, then speak with Leyweaver Azayna. ","Great power comes only with sacrifice. Even the most masterful tailor can only do so much with silkweave. To improve your patterns any further, bargains must be made. You are prepared, <name>, to learn about working with Imbued Silkweave. Use the teleportation crystal behind me, and speak with Azayna, the leader of our order. "
1039,The Path to Suramar City,Assist the nightfallen of Suramar until you discover a way to move safely amongst the elves of Suramar City. ,"I recall Lyndras mentioning a guild of tailors within Suramar City. Perhaps they could further our understanding of how to utilize this new cloth. Unfortunately from what I've heard, they've sided with the demons and anyone opposed to them is to be killed on sight. You must find a way to move safely within the confines of their city if we're to continue our research. "
1040,Secret Silkweaving Methods,Craft some Masterwork Silkweave Bracers. ,"Okay, done mourning! Let's look through his stuff. < Tanithria takes a moment to leaf through Lyndras' journal. Her eyes open wide. >Our friend has been keeping secrets from us. Look at this! Every single one of the recipes he's taught us can be improved. Let's start simple, with some bracers. I can supply most of the materials, but you'll have to talk to Alard Schmied in the blacksmithing shop to get this powdered brimstone. "
1041,Assault on Violet Hold: Into the Hold,Go into Violet Hold and find out what happened to Lyndras. ,"With Lyndras being locked up in Violet Hold, you feel responsible for him and must discover the truth behind his actions. Perhaps if you were able to speak with him, you could find a way to have him released from the hold and put back into your custody. Go into Violet Hold and find out what happened to Lyndras. "
1042,Looming Over Me,Go to the Arinor Gardens and retrieve Khaela's Lightweave Loom. ,"When I rallied to the Xenedar, I left behind a valuable tool. My lightweave loom. Without it, I'm forced to labor for much longer to make garments of power for our allies. But you are powerful, much more so than I. Perhaps you could do me a favor. Should you happen to be in the Arinor Gardens, could you retrieve my loom and return it to me? I'd be more than willing to share my knowledge of sewing lightweave with you. "
1043,Where's Lyndras Again? ,Find Lyndras in Dalaran. ,"Oh dear. He had just promised you that he wouldn't wander off, and then he did it again! I'm starting to think that this Lyndras character might be a bit too impetuous for my tastes. Please, go find him, before he gets into any more trouble. "
1044,Exotic Textiles,Obtain the Fel Inscribed Shroud. ,"I'm risking my life and career to be here, tailor. I've been curious about demonic cloth, and my attempts to obtain some through approved means have been met with resistance. I simply must see this cloth for myself. I don't wish to disrupt Azayna's pact with the demons, but you - you can attack the demons without drawing attention to our guild. I'm particularly interested in a particular demon's set of robes. Bring me a scrap, and I'll teach you what I know. "
1045,Taking Inspiration,Obtain 6 Runed Breeches. ,"I wish I had more patterns to share, but my notebook was lost along with my shop. We'll need to come up with some patterns on our own. I've been thinking about the leather breeches that the Stormheim vrykul wear. They're certainly much thicker and heavier than anything we could sew, but their embellishing runework is quite impressive. If I had a few pairs, perhaps I could re-imagine this runework on a more. . . refined garment. "
1046,This Should Be Simple. . . Right? ,Craft a Handcrafted Silkweave Robe on Tanithria's Finishing Bench. ,"I have plenty of silk patterns that we can put this cloth to work on. Help me to prepare the materials, <name>. We're going to put this cloth to good use and make you a new robe. "
1047,Halls of Valor: The Right Question,Defeat Hymdall in the Halls of Valor and recover his loincloth. ,"One might ask what a leyweaver is doing standing over a dead vrykul's body. But such questions only stir up trouble. Instead let us ask what can be learned from those who have passed on. A question like that promotes progress. I assume you're here to learn from me, the pattern for Imbued Silkweave pants, yes? If that's true, then I'll need something from one who has passed on. In the Halls of Valor the great guardian, Hymdall resides. Bring me his loincloth and I will teach you my pattern. "
1048,Sacred Cloth,Bring 2 Mooncloth to Meilosh in Timbermaw Hold. ,"Although the people of Timbermaw delight in the feel of runecloth, it is not sacred to us.  But mooncloth is sacred. Bring me a small supply of this holy cloth, and I will teach you a secret fashioning technique. "
1049,Sew It Begins,Obtain 10 Shal'dorei Silk. ,"Every time Dalaran takes us to a new shore, I get anxious over what types of fabric and cloth we might find below. Threads imbued with magic? Something demonically-tinged? Ugh, I hope it's not FURS again. You're an adventurer. . . and tailor to boot. Head on down there and see what you can scrounge up! "
1050,A Needle Need,Obtain 150 Spritethorns. ,"This shop has almost everything we need. Unfortunately, the quality of your sewing needles is lacking. I do know where you can get better needles. The sprites of Val'sharah are covered with spines which, fortuitously, are perfect for the type of sewing we need. I hate to be such a prickler stickler, but these needles really will make a difference. "
1051,Meticulous Precision,Bring the Spritethorns to Tiffany Cartier in Dalaran. ,"The needles are sharp, but look at them closely. Some have a curve to them, others have a spur hanging off the side. Look at this one. . . it's got a ninety-degree crook in it! I have no desire to sew around a corner. Tiffany Cartier in the jewelcrafting shop has a good eye for this sort of thing. Bring these needles to her, and she'll straighten them out. "
1052,Runic Catgut,Obtain 3 pieces of Runic Catgut. ,"Let me guess. . . thread troubles? Mm-hm. I suspected as much. My people weave sumptuous silks, but those silks can be fickle about the types of thread they'll accept. Shal'dorei silk has a bit of ley energy woven right into it. You need something that's learned to coexist with the ley energies of this land. I'm talking about owlcats, my good friend! They have what you need. You'll find them amongst the ruins of Llothien. "
1053,Where's Lyndras? ,Find Lyndras. ,"That's strange. Lyndras was here one moment, and then he ran off the next. He had such a strange look on his face. Perhaps we should track him down. "
1054,Advanced Needlework,Make an Embroidered Silkweave Robe on Tanithria's Finishing Bench. ,"You've already learned the patterns for bracers, belts, epaulets, and of course, robes. Unfortunately, your technique was wasteful. . . you need a better method. That's where our needles come in. Here, I'll show you how to improve the process of these patterns. "
1055,Master of Silkweave,"Purchase a Shal'dorei Mannequin from Leyweaver Mithrogane, then craft an entire set of silkweave armor and place them on the mannequin. ","While Tytallo is busy exacting withered genocide, it falls on me to take care of the more mundane aspects of training. We're going to need to see how talented you are. Craft an entire set of silkweave armor for me. Leyweaver Mithrogane can provide you with a proper mannequin for displaying it. "
1056,Cloth Scavenging,As a Tailor I think you are ready to learn what I have to teach. ,I think you will find this skill helps you a great deal on your path to tailoring greatness! 
1057,Consult the Locals,Find a tailor in Azsuna. ,Whoever wove this fabric CAN'T have intended it only for belts and shoulderpads. There must be some way to sew thread into this material. Head on down to Azsuna and try to find a tailor. We need to sew if we're going to do any real tailoring. 
1058,Where's Lyndras Now? ,Go the alchemy shop across the street. ,"Lyndras couldn't have gone very far. I mean, we're floating a thousand feet over the sea. I heard some commotion across the way this morning near the alchemy shop. I pray that wasn't Lyndras. Could you please go over there and make sure? "
1059,The Final Lesson? ,Create a Handcrafted Silkweave Hood on Tanithria's Finishing Bench. ,"Now that we have everything we need, let's work on the hood. After we're finished, we'll move onto the gloves. "
1060,Hard Times,Obtain a Stained Silken Robe and a set of Hatecoil Wristwraps. ,"When I worked at the tailoring guild in Suramar, I would usually work off of a pattern. Something that inspired me. Unfortunately, I've run into streak of bad luck, and I'm ashamed to say that I no longer have my patterns. The naga sorceresses in the lagoon to the west, however, have expertly-sewn wristwraps. And the nightfallen to the north wear robes that we can use. . . if you can pry one from their greedy clutches. "
1061,The Legend of the Threads,Bring Eliezer his lost copy of Nights with the Nightborne. ,"Tailoring is the noblest of professions because clothing is universal. Most dress with nary a thought. If you analyze the legends, some races stand out from all others. The Nightborne are masters of style! Much of the brilliance is in their materials--in particular their thread and their looms. We will take advantage of both. Before you gather materials, I need to confirm my list. Find the fashion treatise I brought with me. Perhaps I dropped it by the flight master? "
1062,The Thread of Shadow,Defeat Advisor Vandros in the Arcway in Mythic difficulty and extract Shadow Thread from his robes. ,"Vandros of the Nightborne. There is an elf who knows how to dress. Ever since he was a young noble in the Court of Farondis, Vandros has been known for snappy, fashion forward outfits. I've never been able to see his garments up close but my research tells me that his tailor's technique is not so much in the fabric as it is in the thread. It appears to be spun of the very shadows themselves. You have your methods to obtain it, I'm sure. Get his robes and get the thread. "
1063,Starweave and Shadowcloth,Make a bolt of Starweave and a bolt of Shadowcloth. ,"At last, you are ready for true tailoring knowledge. I truly think you've earned it. I've fashioned the materials you've gathered into a satchel of Legendary Tailor's Materials. Go to the Queen's Grace Loom and weave two bolts of cloth. With my careful research of fashion, heroes, and legends. I believe the new cloth you will make will echo through the ages. Hurry! "
1064,Eye of Azshara: The Depraved Nightfallen,"Go to the Eye of Azshara, defeat the Wrath of Azshara and recover the Heart of the Storm. ","In order to craft the gloves, we'll require a special item. This will be no easy task to recover it, <name>. The naga of Azsuna are said to be hard at work trying to summon a terrible creature into this world. The creature's heart holds immense energy that we can use to channel into the gloves, making them incredibly powerful. I need. . . I mean, we need that heart if we are to produce a suitable pair of gloves for someone of your presence. "
1065,Left Behind,"Gather Lyndras' Pinking Shears, his Box of Measuring Tools and his Threading Needles from where you first met him in Azsuna. ","I do truly want to help you work on your tailoring, but without my patterns or my supplies, there isn't much more I can do save for teaching you what little I remember. If my memory still serves true, you're just missing a good pattern for some gloves and a hood. The first thing I need you to do is grab a few things from where you first met me. Here's what I need. . . "
1066,The Nightborne Connection,Speak with Leyweaver Tytallo in Suramar. ,"Now that you're able to disguise yourself, you should go to Suramar City and try to find this guild of tailors. Good luck, <name>, and try not to get caught. "
1067,Where's Lyndras: Sewer Sleuthing,Search the sewers for clues as to where Lyndras has gone. ,Linzy said that Lyndras escaped down into the sewers of Dalaran. Surely there must be a clue down there as to his whereabouts. Hopefully he hasn't caused any more commotion amongst the citizens of Dalaran. 
1068,So You Think You Can Sew,Craft a Rune-Threaded Silkweave Robe and a set of Rune-Threaded Silkweave Bracers at Lyndras' Finishing Table. ,"Very good, I think we're ready to begin. < Lyndras steals a glance at your powerful weapon. A look of hunger washes over his face before he shakes it off and continues. >Let's prepare our materials and make the robe and bracers that you so rightfully deserve! "
1069,The Wayward Tailor,"Speak to Lalla Brightweave in Dalaran, and ask her to summon Lyndras. ","Might I ask a favor, <name>? As I am recently without a home, shop, family, or friends, I was wondering if you might show me your floating city? I must admit, I am VERY curious about the place. I've also heard good things about their tailoring shop. I have no way of getting there myself, but certainly such a magical city has SOMEONE who can summon me. < Lyndras looks at you with hopeful apprehension. >"
1070,"Sew Far, Sew Good",Craft a Silkweave Bag. ,"Your tailoring skill really is impressive and, although I don't have my patterns with me, I do have some patterns memorized. One of those patterns is for a simple bag. Follow my lead, <name>. "
1071,Proof of Loyalty,Slay 25 withered within Suramar. ,"<Tytallo listens as you recount what happened with Lyndras. >I see. You sound almost. . . sympathetic to the wretch. The nightfallen are liars and thieves. ALL of them. Lyndras included. I will not tolerate a student that has any respect or sympathy for those. . . things. And have you witnessed what they turn into at the depths of their depravity? If you want to get on my good side, do not return until you are covered in the blood of the withered. "
1072,The Right Color,Obtain 10 Helsquid Ink. ,"Your assistance, <name>, if you have a moment. I've been attempting to reproduce a pattern for footwear that I spotted a while back, but I'm having trouble getting the right color for my dye. Our black dye is too dark, our blue dye is too bright, and mixing the two doesn't look right. The color I'm looking for is more of a squid-ink blue. If, in your travels, you come across any dyes of this color, would you do me the favor of bringing some to me? "
1073,Cloth Scavenging,The humanoids of the northern lands wear garments that can be converted into cloth if you know how. ,May you slay many humanoids and take their cloth. 
1074,Where's Lyndras: Leyflame Larceny,Ask the Violet Hold guards about Lyndras. ,The guards here must have seen Lyndras come through. The trail of ley dust isn't exactly hard to miss either. Perhaps one of the guards knows what became of Lyndras. 
1075,Killing Time,Kill the Infinite Shade of Delormi. ,"Now, <name>, stand with me.

I am weak. So many threads have been severed.

I'll use what power I have left to mend the rift.

Please. . . make sure the fabric of time is safe from her. "
1076,Cloth Scavenging,The cut of your clothes suggests to me that you are a Tailor yourself and could easily learn the skill that I have to teach. ,Turn that extra cloth you find into something that looks marvelous! 
1077,Drapings of the Ancients,Obtain 100 Ancient Imbued Silkweave from humanoids in Broken Shore. ,"<name>, we are going to need a high quality cloth to work with. Thankfully, the weaving quality of nightborne craftspeople from long ago was very good. It is a lost art to some degree but I feel like you can take their masterworks and do even more with it. Some of the hostiles in these parts still wear Ancient Imbued Silkweave Armor. Start to unstitch the silkweave cloth from any of that armor that you find on Broken Shore. "
1078,Step Into Her Shoes,Enter the Time Rift with Timeweaver Delormi. ,"Another one of those rifts. Normally I'd repair it, but given the circumstances I wish to see where it leads.

It isn't often I commune with versions of myself from other threads of time. But one particular self has been a dear friend for some time.

I feel myself growing weaker. If she perishes. . .

We don't have much time. We need to enter this rift now. "
1079,Lining Them Up,Gather 15 Bear Furs. ,"Since you're heading to Azsuna, you may as well gather some lining for our projects. The bears of Azsuna are known for how soft, yet durable their fur is. Hunt them in the woods around Llothien and bring their fur back with you. "
1080,Cut from the Same Cloth,Ask Timeweaver Delormi to return you to your time. ,"My Infinite self was right. I can no longer mend time.

Too many of my threads have been purged. I can feel no others.

I'm alone now. And my thread is gone. But not you.

Take this recipe. You've proven yourself a talented tailor in your own time, and a savior in so many more.

The fabric of time needs your hands to mend it. I trust you with that responsibility.

Talk to me when you're ready. I'll take you back to when this all began. "
1081,Seam Stress,Follow Delormi through the Time Rift. ,"I. . . I need a moment, <name>.

<Delormi seems disoriented and grabs your shoulder for support. She presses her hand against her forehead and stands there for a minute. 

Finally shaking off whatever she was feeling, she stands up straight and faces you. >

There are gaps in my memories. Things important to me, lost now. We must stop her at all costs, <name>. "
1082,Where's Lyndras: Downward Spiral,Continue following Lyndras' trail. ,"Flitz mentioned a manhole near Violet Hold, perhaps that would be the best place to pick up Lyndras' trail. "
1083,Rolling Up the Sleeves,Kill 12 Chronal Anomalies. ,"The Caverns of Time? Strange. . . I spent many timelines in this very place.

What's special about here-- now?

We'll have to discern as much later on. It looks like we aren't the only ones who've been affected by these rifts. . .

Let's do the Bronze Dragonflight a favor and clear out these anomalies. "
1084,Tearing at the Seams,Speak with Delormi when you're ready to leave and investigate the disturbance. ,"I feel odd. . . weak. As though something is affecting my very existence.

Would you come with me, <name>? I may need your help. At the very least, you could be a witness to whatever happens should something dire occur. "

1086,A Friend in Needle,Collect 5 Tidespray Linen and 5 Deep Sea Satin. ,"You can see me?

Oh, thank goodness! I thought I was lost in the folds of time. . . again!

But for one to see through the folds of time's fabric. . . you must be a very talented tailor, indeed.

Would you bring me some cloth, then, tailor? I believe I'll be able to place just when I am with your help and right myself. "
1087,Cloth Scavenging,You look like someone who knows their way around a needle and thread so maybe I can help you. ,Come back when you have the skill and I can provide all of your tailoring training. 
1088,The Thread of Souls,Defeat Grand Magistrix Elisande in the Nighthold and extract Soul Thread from her wraps. ,"Have you ever had a chance to lay eyes on Elisande, Grand Magistrix of the Nightborne? Stunning! Fashion-forward! Nice posture! You'd do well to take a page from her book! In fact, you'd tell well to take the thread from her Suramari Soul Wraps! These hold great symbolic value to her people so it's doubtful she will give them willingly. So be it, take her out and get that thread. "
1089,The Thread of Starlight,Defeat Advisor Melandrus in the Court of Stars and extract Starlight Thread from his bracers. ,"Melandrus of the Nightborne is First Blade of Elisande. Perhaps you've heard of him? He is a great hero to the Nightborne but, to be absolutely honest, he is a mess with regards to style. His accoutrements are somewhat better and a particular pair or bracers are rather nice. In fact, the thead that binds them will be absolutely perfect for your pending outfits. Why don't you get that for me and we will talk further. "
1090,If The Shoe Fits. . . ,Stop the Shade of Delormi from killing Magistrix Delormi. ,"That thing is killing her. . . it's killing *me*!

Please, I need your help to save my self! "
1091,Saving Nine,Enter the Time Rift. ,"I saw her in there, destroying another part of my timeline.

With every thread she severs, I lose myself more and more. . .

I can only end this with your support. "
1092,A Friend in Needle,Collect 5 Tidespray Linen and 5 Deep Sea Satin. ,"You can see me?

We make sure the fabric of time stays, well, mended. But I've found a number of new tears cropping up.

In fact, I believe that's why I've arrived here in this time. Perhaps you could assist me in tracking them down and repairing them? "

We have recovered tomes from their caves that detail their leadership hierarchy. The artifacts indicate that their leader, Korrak the Bloodrager, tends to remain hidden until given a reason to make his presence known. Death to Korrak would mean death to Winterax Clan! Slay him and return. "

","The mines in Alterac Valley hold more than just minerals.  Both the Frostwolf and Stormpike have cached excess supplies in the Irondeep and Coldtooth mines. . . that's not a bad idea, if we could only maintain control of them! Capture a mine, then return to me.  To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.  When you do that, the mine will be ours, and we'll send troops to protect it! "
1888,Capture a Mine,"Capture a mine, then return to Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl in Frostwolf Village.

1894,Empty Stables,Locate a Frostwolf in Alterac Valley. ,"The war in the valley has taken its toll on our soldiers. We must revitalize our forces! If we can fill up the stables, the Wolf Riders will once more be able to ride out into the field of battle. Take this muzzle and track down the frostwolves that inhabit the nearby forest. Once you find a wolf, use the muzzle to tame the beast. Bring the tamed beast back to me so that I may place it in the stable. When we have enough wolves stabled, the Wolf Riders will rejoin their patrol on our front lines. "
1895,Armor Scraps,Bring 20 Armor Scraps to Murgot Deepforge in Dun Baldar. ,"Battles rage constantly in Alterac Valley, and the supplies we get from Ironforge are not enough to outfit our experienced troops.

1896,Towers and Bunkers,"Capture an enemy tower or bunker, then return to Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl in Frostwolf Village. ","Towers and bunkers are important positions, and we must capture and hold them all!  So to that end, I want you to attack a bunker that is controlled by the enemy. To do that, enter one with an Alliance banner.  You will see another banner inside.  Pull out that banner, and a white Horde banner will appear in its place.  Well done! At that point your task for me will be complete, but if you hold the place long enough, and if the Alliance doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed! "
1897,Irondeep Supplies,Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the Alliance Quartermaster in Dun Baldar. ,"Before the fighting started, we stored supplies for Dun Baldar in the Irondeep mine.  The troggs that surfaced there weren't much of a problem when we had spare troops to guard the mine, but now that we're fighting with the Horde we can't maintain control of Irondeep. We need the supplies in Irondeep, <name>.  Enter the mine and bring me a load of them. "

1901,Coldtooth Supplies,Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the Horde Quartermaster in Frostwolf Keep. ,"The Coldtooth mine to the north was once an ideal place to store extra supplies, but now that the fighting with the Stormpikes grows fierce, we do not always have the spare warriors to station at the mine and protect it.  And so, control of the mine often falls to the Alliance, or to underground denizens. . . But we still need our supplies, <name>!  Go to the Coldtooth mine and bring me a load of them.  And be wary of enemies as you go; the tides of battle shift quickly in that place. . . "

1904,Towers and Bunkers,"Destroy the banner at an enemy tower or bunker, then return to Sergeant Durgen Stormpike in the Dun Baldar. ","Towers and bunkers are key defensive positions, and so we must hold as many as possible!  I want you to attack a tower or a bunker in Alterac Valley. To do that, enter a tower with a Horde banner atop it.  You will see another enemy banner inside.  Pull out that banner, and a white Alliance banner will appear in its place.  Well done! At that point your mission for me will be complete, but hold the area long enough, and if the Horde doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed! "
1905,Irondeep Supplies,Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the Horde Quartermaster in Frostwolf Keep. ,"The Stormpike dwarves are using the Irondeep mine as a storage depot.  I want you to raid that mine and bring me its supplies.  This will curtail the Stormpikes' efforts in Alterac Valley, and will provide us with needed equipment! Be wary, <name>.  The Irondeep mine is deep in Alliance territory, and control of the mine is as shifting as the snows of Alterac. "
1906,Coldtooth Supplies,Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the Alliance Quartermaster in Dun Baldar. ,"The Coldtooth mine is a storage depot for the Horde.  I can't stomach the food they give their troops, and the state of their arms and armor is atrocious!  But. . . in times like these when supplies are so important, we can use what they have. Enter the Coldtooth mine and bring me back their supplies.  That will help keep the Alliance in fighting shape, and remove much needed equipment from the Horde's warriors. Good luck, <name>.  The mine is to the distant south, deep in Horde territory. "
1907,Alterac Valley Graveyards,"Assault a graveyard, then return to Sergeant Durgen Stormpike in Dun Baldar. ","The graveyards in Alterac Valley are prized territories.  Both the Horde and the Alliance fight savagely for these sacred grounds.  Are you, <name>, ready to join that fight? I want you to assault an enemy graveyard.  Find a graveyard with a Horde banner in its midst, and pull it from the ground!  Do that, and your task will be complete. . . . But if you can also hold the graveyard for a few minutes, then our troops will soon come to relieve you. "
1908,Empty Stables,Locate an Alterac Ram in Alterac Valley. ,"Just look at the stables, <name>! Empty! The Stormpike Brigade has no rams to ride - the cavalry is defunct. You must help us, soldier. Take this training collar and enter the wilds of this valley. Locate the Alterac rams that roam throughout the area and use the collar to snare one. When you have captured a ram, return it to me and I shall place it in our stable. When we have enough rams, the ram rider commander will be notified. With your help, the cavalry will be reborn! "

I will get to the point: I believe I can cast a spell that will nullify Gul'dan's mind control over his assassin Garona.

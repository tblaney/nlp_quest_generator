Hezrul leads his people from the Lushwater Oasis, to the south. "
62,The Moss-twined Heart,Bring the Moss-twined Heart to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth. ,"The heart of Blackmoss the Fetid is covered with a dark, oily moss.

The contents of the globe are, at best, disgusting.  It would be safe to assume that whatever has befouled the water of Mystral Lake is most likely present in the water of the globe.

Then I've got bad news for you. The Venomhide Ravasaurs, they're all poison: Poison blood, poison spit, poison skin. You climb on one, you fall off dead in a few hours. You'd have to build up a resistance to their toxins before I sold you one, and that takes a long, LONG time. . . you'd need to be splashed with poisonous blood while fighting one numerous times. If you're really interested, the venomhides prefer the northern area of the Marshlands, northwest of here. "
82,They Grow Up So Fast,"Return 20 Venomhide Baby Teeth,  the Venomhide Hatchling, 20 Runecloth, 20 Rugged Leather, and 80 gold to Mor'vek in the southeastern part of the Marshlands in Un'Goro Crater.

98,Lord Banehollow,Slay Lord Banehollow. ,"Only one final power remains lurking in the depths of Shadow Hold now: Lord Banehollow.

127,Simmer Down Now,Captain Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge wants you to defeat Tideress and 12 Befouled Water Elementals at Mystral Lake. ,"You should've seen it, <class>!

Will you help me to put an end to it, little <race>? I have overheard their herbalists speaking of something called wildfire upon their table across the way. If you were to take the bottle of this unnatural stuff and throw it at my corpse to the northeast, it would burn and no more of my hair will grow here. I am already dead and it is a small price to pay to stop them. "
129,Dartol's Rod,Use Dartol's Rod to be able to communicate with Krolg at Krolg's Hut in Ashenvale. ,"I'm not completely certain what Teronis had in mind next, but if what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether, presumably that of a furbolg. Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to them, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was uncorrupted. I would start with one known as Krolg. Seek his hut southeast of Mystral Lake. "
130,Sharptalon's Claw,Bring Sharptalon's Claw to Senani Thunderheart at Silverwind Refuge. ,"The mighty hippogryph Sharptalon has been slain, with the claw of the felled beast serving as a testament to your victory. Senani Thunderheart at the Silverwind Refuge will no doubt be interested in seeing this trophy as proof of your deeds. "
131,Gorat's Vengeance,"Use Gorat's Imbued Blood on Gorat's corpse, then defeat Captain Elendilad. ","Fortune is with us this day, <race>. Gorat's blood was fresh enough for me to conduct a special ritual taught to me as a child. Use this imbued blood on Gorat's corpse to summon forth his lingering spirit. Do his final bidding, then report back here to Kadrak. Spirits keep you safe, friend. "
132,Never Again! ,Obtain Gorgannon's Flaming Blade and the Seeker's Fel Spear. ,"<name>, it falls to you to see that this attack by the Burning Legion never comes to pass. You must go and slay their leaders.  Without them the demons will be mindless. You will find Gorgannon in Demon Fall Canyon south beyond Felfire Hill, near Mannoroth's floating, broken spear. Diathorus the Seeker resides somewhere in the barrow den atop Demon Fall Ridge. To find the ridge, look for a ramp up from Demon Fall Canyon near the Horde's monument to Grom Hellscream. Bring me their weapons. "
133,Dread Head Redemption,Speak to Durak in Splintertree Mines. ,"I sense that Durak is more than he seems. Demonic power is dangerous and it is easy to fall to its corruption - even for a trained warlock. 

I do not trust him, <name>.

Find this Durak and tell him that the Horde will have nothing to do with him. "
134,Shadumbra's Head,Bring Shadumbra's Head to Captain Goggath at Hellscream's Watch. ,"The once swift Shadumbra now lies still as you claim victory over it. This legenday creature is dear to the night elves. Its head should serve as an intimidating trophy, and as a sign of the end of the Alliance in Ashenvale. Captain Goggath at Hellscream's Watch will no doubt be delighted to receive the head of the slain nightsaber. "
135,King of the Foulweald,Place the Bloodtooth Banner on the Foulweald Totem Mound. ,"I care little for who you are, <race>. What I do care about is the salvation of the furbolg. Take this Bloodtooth tribe banner a short ways northeast into Greenpaw Village and place it upon their totem mound. They will consider this an act of aggression and try to destroy the banner. Hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe, then kill the traitor! Govern your strength wisely, friend, you're in for a long fight. "
136,Satyr Horns,Collect 16 Satyr Horns for Pixel in Splintertree Post. ,"Heya! I've been traveling through Ashenvale, heading towards Ratchet, and decided to make a stop here at Splintertree. I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days. After asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those satyrs. . . but you look like you might be! Tell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time. "
137,To the Mor'shan Rampart,Report to Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale. ,"Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart to the north is calling for aid. The rampart rests on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale. It is the front line in the fight against the Alliance. We're driving the night elves out of the forest. We'll claim its resources for the Horde! To get there, take the Gold Road north out of the Crossroads. Destiny calls! "
138,Blastranaar! ,Captain Goggath wants you to use Tweedle's Improvised Explosives to kill 20 Astranaar Sentinels and destroy 10 Astranaar Throwers. ,"So, Tweedle finally came through on those explosives, eh? They couldn't have come at a better time. The elves of Astranaar are preparing to make a devastating assault on our camp as we speak. Drop our new weapon on them from the skies! The destruction of Astranaar will be a dagger in the heart of night elves everywhere! Speak with Thraka when you're ready to begin the assault. Aim true, <class>. "
139,Pierce Their Heart! ,Durak wants you to use the Tainted Blood of the Kaldorei on the Forest Heart. ,"There. . . The blood of the fallen Kaldorei is turned. It can now be used on the Forest Heart in Dor'Danil Barrow Den. Doing so will utterly corrupt it. The sacred relic of the arrogant elves will be turned against them. How poetic! < Durak laughs cruelly. >The barrow den lies nestled against the hills to the southeast. One of my imps has laid a blood trail from the entrance to the heart. Make haste! Kadrak is not likely to be in a patient mood. Off you go, <class>. "
140,Dryad Delivery,Deliver the Glowing Gem to Shael'dryn at Raynewood Tower in Ashenvale. ,"Ah, there you are, <name>. I've pored over the notes Teronis has made and it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of Dartol's rod. I would start by heading east along the road to Raynewood Tower. A dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out. Keep the gem with you-- Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod. "
141,Retaking Mystral Lake,Slay 12 Befouled Water Elementals and Tideress. ,"We could easily have held Silverwind Refuge from the Horde had they not taken control of our water elemental defenders on Mystral Lake. One of their shaman summoned in Tideress, an old and angry water spirit of the forest who befouled our elementals and turned them against us. With the lake and the Horde pressing in on us, we had no choice but to retreat to the spire here. Go east. Take the lake back so that we will have a chance to retake the refuge some day. "
142,The Essence of Aku'Mai,Collect 20 Sapphires of Aku'Mai. ,"Within the beginning tunnels of Blackfathom Deeps, there are large sapphire clusters along the cave walls. We noticed that the naga started harvesting the crystals around the same time their weaponry greatly improved. The crystals seem to have great elemental power and, if used inappropriately, could make for a powerful component for my smithing. Will you help me, <name>? Blackfathom Deeps can be found along Zoram Strand to the north of our outpost. "
143,Diabolical Plans,Deliver the Diabolical Plans to Valusha at Splintertree Post in Ashenvale. ,"The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Orcish tongue!  The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts. The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Splintertree Post to the northwest. You're certain that Valusha at Splintertree Post would be interested in these. "
144,Ursangous' Paw,Bring Ursangous' Paw to Captain Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge. ,The mighty bear Ursangous is no more! The small quarter-crescent emblem on its paw indicates that this beast was trained by the night elves to prowl the forest in search of their enemies. There is no telling how many of your Horde allies fell to this creature. The paw should be brought to Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge. He will be pleased that such a weapon has been removed from the enemy's arsenal. 
145,Keep the Fires Burning,Commander Grimfang at Zoram'gar wants you to pour Mystlash Hydra Oil on the lighthouse fire. ,"This is no small task, <race>! We have more ships arriving, and without the lighthouse they'll be lost - or worse! You are hereby charged with keeping its fire lit. Collect the blubber from the hydras in these waters, then bring it to the forge here to melt it into oil. Throwing that oil on the lighthouse fire will buy us the time we need. "
146,Sheelah's Last Wish,Guardian Menerin wants you to deliver the Sealed Missive to Guardian Gurtar. ,"I. . . I cannot believe she's gone. It all happened so fast. . . . I understand that I have you to thank for avenging my mistress. For that, you have my gratitude, and that of Silvermoon. In her wisdom, my lady foresaw this end. She prepared a missive to be delivered in the event that something happened to her. We were to join an Orgrimmar retinue at the crossroads just north of here. Please, <race>, meet them in our stead and see that the message is delivered. "
147,Respect for the Fallen,Retrieve Feero's Holy Hammer and The Purifier's Prayer Book. ,"There were two humans here: Feero Ironhand and Delgren the Purifier. They were members of a holy organization known as The Argent Dawn. Both fell defending the post when the Horde first attacked. I'm going to loan you my magical cloak. It was a gift from Cenarius that allows me to move invisibly. Find both of their corpses and retrieve Feero's hammer and Delgren's prayer book. Feero's corpse is in the courtyard and Delgren's is atop the tower. Beware, the warlock up there will be able to see you. "
148,Find Gorat! ,Kadrak at Mor'shan Ramparts wants you to search the Fallen Sky Lake region for Gorat. ,"Gorat is one of the Horde's most adept assassins. The mere mention of his name strikes fear into the hearts of our Alliance foes. He is reliable, fiercely loyal, and - until now - punctual. Something's not right, <class>. Gorat 's mission was to find and eliminate the elf in charge of this assault on the ramparts. He should be somewhere in the region of Fallen Sky Lake. Find him! "
149,Closure is Only Natural,Use Gnarl's Bough to close 10 Demon Gates. ,"Through the ground I can feel more demons being brought into our world. Soon there will be too many and we will be overrun without hope of turning them back. Take this piece of me and return to Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge, south of Felfire Hill. Aim the bough at a demon gate and concentrate. I have stored a portion of the forest's life force in its wood, and it will close the gate. "
150,Report from the Northern Front,Deliver Sentinel Melyria's report to Sentinel Farsong at Silverwing Grove in Ashenvale. ,"The battle against the Horde isn't being waged from Raynewood Tower alone, <name>. There's a more substantial Silverwing Sentinel presence at Silverwing Grove to the southeast, near the border with the Barrens. From the grove, Sentinel Farsong directs our efforts against those who would destroy our lands. I'm a bit late in sending my latest report to her, but also hesitant to leave the tower unattended. I am in dire need of your help in getting this report to her as soon as possible! "
151,Clear the Shrine,Slay any 12 demons at Fire Scar Shrine. ,"An end must be put to the Burning Legion's evil! <name>, you have defeated one of their most powerful, but there are still multitudes of demons infesting the woods to the east in Fire Scar Shrine. As a friend of the forest, will you slay these foul creatures and then warn Big Baobob, the great ancient of war at the Shrine of Aessina to the northeast? "
152,Corrupting Influence? ,Deliver the Troll Charm to Raene Wolfrunner at Astranaar in Ashenvale. ,"As you search through the belongings of the dead furbolg lying before you, a small charm, very obviously created by trolls,  spills out onto the ground. Touching the charm, you immediately get a sense that something is not right about the wood. A feeling of unease, of corruption, permeates the object. Wrapping it in some spare cloth, you put it in your pack and resolve to show it to Raene Wolfrunner when next you find yourself in Astranaar. "
153,Delivery for Orendil,Deliver the Bag of Bathran's Hair to Orendil Broadleaf at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale. ,"Quickly, <name>. I will put the Bathran's Hair into this bag, but you must deliver it to my master, Orendil Broadleaf. You will find him at Maestra's Post, just south down the road on the left. But beware, we've received reports that the post is under attack from the Horde! "
154,Orendil's Cure,Bring Orendil's Cure to Pelturas Whitemoon at Astranaar in Ashenvale. ,"<name>, now that it has been bathed in Elune's blessed light, I believe that the concoction will help the afflicted child. Please, take it to Astranaar and give it to the child's parent, Pelturas Whitemoon. To reach Astranaar, follow the road south and then east. However, if you'd like to get there more swiftly, speak with Sentinel Avana. "
155,Destroy the Legion,"Slay any 15 demons at Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon, and Demon Fall Ridge. ","I will not tolerate their existence on this world! The Burning Legion all but destroyed our race and we fell back to settle a new home on a new world. Then they came again and we retreated, over and over. No more! There is a remnant of the Legion to the south and west in the regions known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge. They are what is leftover from a force that once long ago invaded this world. Go and destroy as many as you can before it is too late! "
156,In the Hands of the Perverse,Obtain 5 Fallen Moonstones. ,"My former clan, the Felmusk of Night Run, raided Fallen Sky Lake some time ago, stealing the moonstones that were unique to the area. Those moonstones are known to have great healing properties and surely can be used to cure the little girl that lies sick in Astranaar. Night Run rests up the road to the east that runs north. There are multiple paths that lead up into the hills on its eastern side, and it is there that you will find my unrepentant brethren. They will have what you seek. "
157,Rain of Destruction,"Using Accursed Ore to mark targets for Draaka, you are to kill 30 Night Elf troops and 5 Raging Ancients. ","Just in time, <class>. The elves have launched another attack! From the guard towers, use the accursed ore to mark targets for Draaka. Her projectiles will strike your target and erupt in fel magic flame, destroying any nearby enemies. There is strong prejudice against the use of demonic magics. Unjustified, but real nonetheless. For this reason, I will transform you into an imp for the duration of the mission to prevent you from being identified. "
158,Playing Possum,"Obtain the final piece of Dartol's Rod, the Iron Pommel. ","The last piece of the rod is held by druids of the claw. I asked their leader, Oso Bramblescar, to give it to me, but he and his guardians nearly killed me! Clearly they too were affected by the Horde's corruption of the Forest Heart. But, I have an idea for how you can get into Oso's cave and grab the pommel. Ever since I was a faun, I've been pretty good at playing possum. It works great against bears! I can teach you! Go east to the Shady Nook, and if they try to get you, just use my technique. "
159,Ashenvale Outrunners,Kill 9 Ashenvale Outrunners. ,"Blasted elves! Dey knew right where to hit us! It was dem outrunners. . . I tried to warn 'em that we were being spied on, but no one listened. Now look at us - cooped up here like chickens! Never too late for vengeance, mon! Hunt 'em down and make 'em pay for what they done! "
160,Finding Teronis,Find Teronis at Lake Falathim in Ashenvale. ,"A friend of mine from Astranaar, Raene Wolfrunner, asked me to send a scout west to Lake Falathim. Teronis left days ago, just before the Horde attacked. He was searching for an item he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard. Before he left, he mentioned a gem for the rod. Unfortunately, we know that the lake has been invaded by some evil force. Please, <name>, find my friend. "
161,Thunder Peak,Broyk wants you to find Stikwad at Thunder Peak. ,"Greetings, <class>. Congratulations on your victorious assault on Astranaar. The elves shall not soon forget the humiliation they have suffered at your hand. But you must know, the elves are not the only obstacle to the Horde's conquering of Ashenvale. . . . To the east, a shaman of the Earthen Ring requires assistance with yet another crisis. You can find him near the base of the volcano, Thunder Peak. "
162,Wet Work,"Krokk wants you to kill Dorinar, Arminon, Endolar, and 12 Ashenvale Scouts. ","Listen carefully, <class>. There are three leaders in this region who are commanding the elves, keeping their focus directed on the lumber camp. Slaying them will certainly cause panic and disarray, hopefully enough for us to successfully complete our mission. While you're at it, bringing down their scouts can only aid our cause. "
163,Ruuzel,Obtain the Ring of Zoram. ,"I fear the ancient statuette's secrets will remain forever hidden unless you find the key to their ancient locks. That key is a ring, the Ring of Zoram. It belonged to the rulers of this city before the waves of the Sundering drowned it. For years the ring was lost, but the naga have recently found it. Their leader, Ruuzel, dwells on her isle on the northern edge of the Zoram Strand. Please, <name>, retrieve the ring for me! "
164,As Good as it Gets,Krokk wants you to enter the Warsong Lumber Camp and speak with Overseer Gorthak. ,"Well, <class>, this is as good as it gets. The elves are scrambling to recover from your recent deeds. There's no better time to break into the lumber camp! Make your way in and speak with Overseer Gorthak. He'll instruct you as to how best escort the diplomat to safety. Good luck! "
165,Search the Bole,Find the Wooden Key and use it to obtain the Iron Shaft portion of Dartol's Rod. ,"I wish your tidings were better. Raene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted. To find the next piece of the rod, you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in. The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here near the Felwood border, at the Howling Vale. Once you have it, look for a small glade through the tunnel at the vale. The chest should be hidden around there. "
166,Stopping the Rituals,Disturb 8 Ritual Gems. ,"I could not help but overhear Illiyana's loss. I understand her need for revenge. I am wondering if while you are exacting it, you could do us a service? No doubt you have already seen the satyr of Satyrnaar and Xavian conducting vile rituals. I believe that they are preparing their rituals to corrupt any of the night elves they capture, turning them into satyrs. We draenei also have problems with fel magic exposure. Would you disturb their ritual gems while you are there? "
167,Hero's Call: Ashenvale! ,Report to Sentinel Shyela at Ordanil's Retreat in northwestern Ashenvale. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Sentinel Shyela at Orendil's Retreat in northwestern Ashenvale. The Horde's aggression in Ashenvale cannot be allowed to stand! Your help is needed to repel the invaders and restore the sacred forest. Head south through the Twilight Vale in Darkshore to reach the forest of Ashenvale. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
168,Vortex,Use the powers of the Whirling Vortex to slay Lord Magmathar. ,"The time has come, <name>. When you have steeled yourself we will speak again and I will summon forth a whirling vortex to speed your way up to the skies over Thunder Peak. Channel the power of the Earthen Ring through the elemental to slay Lord Magmathar so that we may bring him into balance once more. "
169,The Shadewalker,Speak with Gaivan Shadewalker pacing outside the entrance to the Dor'Danil Barrow Den in Ashenvale. ,"Now that the demon gates have been destroyed, the power of the forest must be replenished. The Forest Heart must be retrieved! Gaivan Shadewalker, a powerful druid of the claw, has gone southwest, past Felfire Hill, to the Dor'Danil Barrow Den. Therein rests the Forest Heart. It is protected by the druids of Ashenvale deep below the ground. Seek out Gaivan and tell him of what has transpired, <name>. "
170,Return Fire,Use an Astranaar Thrower to shoot down 15 Hellscream's Hellions & their Watch Wind Riders. ,"The fires are mostly contained, but we have to do something about those wind riders! Quick, <name>, you have to jump into one of our glaive throwers and return fire! "
171,All's Well,Deliver the Sanctified Moonstones to Pelturas Whitemoon at Astranaar in Ashenvale. ,"Thank you for saving me from a fate worse than death, <name>! For saving both the child and myself! Well, the child is almost saved. All you have to do is take the moonstones back west down the road to Astranaar. Hand them to Pelturas and he will know what to do. Go in peace, my friend. Elune be praised! "
172,Playing With Felfire,Draaka in Splintertree wants you to fill the Reinforced Canister with 7 Felfires from Felfire Hill. ,"<Draaka leans down to speak to you. >Listen. . . Before you say anything, I KNOW we're not to meddle with demonic energies. . . . But look around you! These are desperate times, <class>. We'll most likely die here, regardless. May as well go out in a blaze of glory, I say! So. . . Are you in? Take this canister and go southeast to Felfire Hill. Use it near the patches of felfire and bring it back to me when you've filled it. Oh, and best not to mention this to anyone. . . . "
173,Making Stumps,Krokk wants you to use the Splintertree Axe to cut down the Ashenvale Oaks in Warsong Lumber Camp. ,"As you've been told by now, we are to escort a diplomat from within the besieged lumber camp to safety. As it stands, that's simply impossible. The elves have a thousand arrows trained on the camp's exits. First we must create a diversion - something that will take their eyes off of the camp for a time. My idea is simple. Take this axe and cut down the trees they've been nurturing in the region. When you're through, light the brazier here to speak with me again. "
174,Troll Charm,Bring 8 Troll Charms to Mitsuwa at Hellscream's Watch. ,"My kinfolk were traveling here with many sacred troll charms, but the Thistlefur furbolgs attacked and killed them before they reached Zoram'gar!  Those vile furbolgs! I miss my brothers and sisters who were killed, but we will meet again in the afterlife.  However, their troll charms hold great value in this world.  It is an outrage that the furbolgs have them! <name>, you must retrieve the charms!  They are in chests in Thistlefur Hold, a cave at the end of Thistlefur Village, north of Astranaar. "
175,Vortex,Use the powers of the Whirling Vortex to slay Lord Magmathar. ,"The time has come, <name>. When you have steeled yourself we will speak again and I will summon forth a whirling vortex to speed your way up to the skies over Thunder Peak. Channel the power of the Earthen Ring through the elemental to slay Lord Magmathar so that we may bring him into balance once more. "
176,Stalemate,Thagg at Raynewood Retreat wants you to kill Keeper Ordanus. ,"The triage kits will help us keep up the fight, but we are at a stalemate. The dryads die easy enough, but their leader is resurrecting them soon after they fall. We face an endless stream of the vermin! Keeper Ordanus hides in that mutated tree. Our efforts to fight our way to him have been in vain. Perhaps you could work your way to him while we contend with his dryads. . . Surely, this is child's play for someone who has conquered Astranaar. No? "
177,Warchief's Command: Ashenvale! ,Report to Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale. ,"All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale. Aid in driving the night elves from the forest, so that we may claim its resources for our people! To reach the Mor'shan Rampart, you must take the Gold Road north from Crossroads in the Northern Barrens. Destiny calls! "
178,Too Far Gone,Obtain Bloodclaw's Collection. ,"Yes, I speak your tongue, <race>. We furbolg have been through this kind of corruption before. Not long ago our leader stole the Idol of Remulos. The demon-tainted thing ensorcelled the entire tribe and our redemption was barely delivered by a druid known as Broll Bearmantle. But this time, we did not steal. The trolls of Zoram'gar gave us the charms as a sign of friendship. A deadly friendship it would seem. Our chief, Dal Bloodclaw, is too far gone. Enter the hold and return with his charms. "
179,Astranaar's Burning! ,Extinguish 15 fires. ,"<class>, Astranaar's burning! Quickly, take this bucket of water and put out the fires before there's nothing left! "
180,Got Lumber? ,Truun wants you to ride Brutusk to the Warsong Labor Camp. ,"Kadrak has just received fresh orders for our troops. I hear we're to begin offensive strikes into Ashenvale! I have far too few supplies to support an assault, and my shipment from Orgrimmar has yet to arrive. I am forced to  improvise, and could use your help, <class>. Speak with Kadrak and ask him for the reins to Brutusk. The kodo will take you to the Warsong Labor Camp. Once there, seek out Gorka and ask her to load you up with logs. "
181,Bathed in Light,Create a Bathed Concoction. ,"The concoction is not quite complete; it must be bathed within the Light of Elune before we can even think about giving it to the child. There is a known location just to the west at Lake Falathim where the goddess's moonlight always touches down, day or night. Please, <name>, I implore you for the sake of Relara, take the concoction and bathe it in Elune's radiance. But beware, strange things have befallen the area of the lake, and I fear that it is no longer safe to go there. "
182,All Apologies,Draaka wants you to bring her Letter of Explanation to Eitrigg in Orgrimmar. ,"This could be the end of me. . . Perhaps my actions were not thought out as well as they should have been. . . The good news is that we pushed back an attack that would have otherwise meant the end of Splintertree. Let us pray that Saurfang sees it that way. I am certain to be summoned to Orgrimmar to explain my actions. Please, <name>, go ahead of me and present this letter to his advisor Eitrigg. Do what you can to soften his heart towards me. "
183,West to the Strand,Speak with Talen at the Blackfathom Camp in Ashenvale. ,"<name>, I have a friend who could make good use of particular talents. His name is Talen and he's an archaeologist of sorts. Recently he's been fascinated with the upheaval of the old city of Zoram and its treasures. If you're willing to lend him a hand, you can find him at the Blackfathom Camp down the path to the west. "
184,Mission Improbable,Kadrak wants you to light the Smoldering Brazier across from Satyrnaar. ,"I have a special mission that requires a well equipped, competent <class>. As I have no one else to spare, I suppose I'll have to settle for you. . . The enemy has assaulted Warsong Lumber Camp and cut it off from the rest of our forces. An important blood elf diplomat en route to Orgrimmar is trapped there. She must be liberated. Take the road northeast and light the smoldering brazier to summon our operative there. Do whatever he might require of you. Dismissed! "
185,The Ancient Statuettes,Collect 10 Ancient Statuettes. ,"I would charge you with a task, <class>. I was on my boat, skimming over the submerged ruins of Zoram, when naga attacked me, surging from the water and tearing at me with their claws! I fled and the rest, as they say, is history. I am an archaeologist of sorts, and I am attempting to recover artifacts of the lost city. Will you head out onto the Zoram Strand to the southwest and recover any ancient statuettes you come across? They are the reason I have braved the dangers of the Zoram Strand. "
186,Empty Quivers,Truun at Mor'shan Ramparts wants you to collect 10 Serviceable Arrows from the Fallen Sky Lake region. ,"Greetings, <class>, and welcome to the Ramparts. Things may appear a little chaotic here but do not worry. Kadrak has this juncture sealed up tight. Not a single elf has breached our lines! While you're here. . . I'm expecting a shipment of fresh supplies from Orgrimmar any day, but our watchmen are running dangerously low on arrows. Bring me any you find and I will make it worth your trouble. "
187,Sentinel Basic Care Package,"You've certainly begun to prove yourself to us, &lt; name&gt; . ","You've certainly begun to prove yourself to us, <name>.  As a reward, please take this care package!  Inside it you'll find rations and bandages that are usable only inside Warsong Gulch. As you continue to prove yourself inside the Gulch, you'll find that these items will become available to you for purchase.  Rations become available when you are Friendly with us, and bandages when you are Honored. "
188,Diabolical Plans,Deliver the Diabolical Plans to Vindicator Vedaar at the Warsong Lumber Camp in Ashenvale. ,"The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Common tongue!  The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts. The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Forest Song to the north, the location where a new draenei settlement is being established. Perhaps Vindicator Vedaar at the Warsong Lumber Camp would be interested in these? "
189,Return to Raene,Deliver Dartol's Rod to Raene Wolfrunner at Astranaar in Ashenvale. ,"I suggest you find Raene and let her know the rod is finished. I'm sure she'll know what your next course should be. Be careful. . . I sense a great deal of power within it for both good and ill. I hope that you and Raene know what you are doing. Good luck, <name>. "
190,Management Material,Convince Demoralized Peons to work and collect 5 bundles of Freshly Cut Wood. ,"Truun needs wood, huh? Normally I could provide, but not today. With constant elf attacks, gathering lumber is dangerous work. The peons I have left are reluctant to venture into the woods. You want wood? Then you go convince the peons to work. And keep them safe! I cannot afford to lose any more! "
191,The Lost Gem,Find the Glowing Gem. ,"As you rummage through Teronis' belongings, you find a water-damaged journal. Quickly flipping through the last legible pages, you read that Teronis makes mention of finding the gem, but then of having lost it in the Falathim area. The only thing left to do is find it. Perhaps the tendrils have it. . . ? "
192,A New Adornment,Obtain Ran Bloodtooth's Skull and Dartol's Rod. ,"I'm certain that the long-dead wizard, Dartol, intended to use his rod to subjugate and destroy us just as the night elves and orcs have, but I think now we'll put that thing to an unintended use. Ran Bloodtooth is the king of all of the Ashenvale furbolg. His tribe, the Bloodtooth, are the most powerful and keep themselves secluded in a camp just to the east. Kill them all and bring back his skull. Let us see if we can put it to good use. "
193,Recover the Remains,Collect 10 Warsong Lumber. ,"While what the satyrs have done to the trees is horrible, nothing compares to the mass slaughter that the orcs have been engaging in! <The ancient shakes with visible rage, his leaves falling all around you. ><race>, I would have you head across the road here at the lumber camp and recover the remains of those trees, treants, and ancients that the Horde have hewn down in their prime. "
194,Vile Satyr! Dryads in Danger! ,Find Anilia at Xavian in Ashenvale. ,"Listen, I don't know who you are, but I need your help. My sisters went to take back the Branch of Cenarius from the satyr. They said they'd be back soon, but it's been two whole days! <name>, you have to find them! They were looking for the ruins of a night elf temple in Xavian to the northwest. I don't know what to think. Look for Anilia, she was leading them on the search. "
195,In a Bind,Obtain Kaliva's Heart. ,"<name>, you must be cautious. Kaliva is still about and when she captured us, she specifically mentioned your name. Only her heart can free us from these chains, but I think it's all a trap for you! "
196,Defend the Tree! ,Speak with Halannia to summon the Shade of Shadumbra and use its power to destroy any 50 Warsong enemies at Raynewood Retreat. ,"We have been using the power of the Forest Heart to defend the tree from the Horde, but its power is not without limit. We must use it to take the fight to them! Shadumbra, the great cat of the forest, prowls nearby. It is from her that we shall draw our inspiration. You will become one with the shade of Shadumbra. You will take the essence of the panther into you and lay waste to those who dare attack the might of Ashenvale! "
197,"Small Stature, Short Fuse",Use the Improvised Explosive Stick on the Broken-down Wagon at Hellscream's Watch. ,"< Tweedle gesticulates emphatically. >I've done it! This should satisfy even Goggath! We just need a test that will sufficiently show off our efforts. . . ahh, the wagon! The bossman's wanted that rotted out piece of junk hauled off for days. Use my explosives to get rid of it, then see what the captain has to say! "
198,Freedom to Ruul,"Escort Ruul, then speak with Yama Snowhoof in Splintertree Post. ","Eh?  Who are you? <name>?  You're no furbolg.  They are cursed!  They thought I was a bear and captured me, and now they starve me!  My strength is failing. . . Help me escape, then speak with my sister Yama at the Splintertree Post to the east. <name>! I must escape! "
199,Crisis at Splintertree,Gorka wants you to accompany her to Mor'shan Ramparts and report to Kadrak. ,There will be no help coming from Splintertree. The elves have launched a major assault on our stronghold there and they have the place surrounded! We must inform Kadrak or die trying! Your kodo has been loaded up with the wood you collected. Let me know when you're ready and we'll charge the enemy lines. 
200,Sentinel Advanced Care Package,"You've certainly begun to prove yourself to us, &lt; name&gt; . ","You've certainly begun to prove yourself to us, <name>.  As a reward, please take this care package!  Inside it you'll find rations and bandages that are usable only inside Warsong Gulch. As you continue to prove yourself inside the Gulch, you'll find that these items will become available to you for purchase.  Rations become available when you are Friendly with us, and bandages when you are Honored. "
201,Deep Despair,Kill 6 Blackfathom Tide Priestesses. ,"There is more to this naga problem than meets the eye, <class>.  It appears that the issue will not be resolved by merely thinning their numbers. To humble them, a more severe impression must be made. Travel to the northern end of Zoram Strand and enter Blackfathom Deep. Once there, demonstrate to the naga that their presence in this region will no longer be tolerated! "
202,The Goblin Braintrust,Obtain Sploder's Head. ,"If we could just stop the damned bombing from the goblins' creations we'd be able to launch a counter-offensive to take back Silverwind Refuge! It's been my experience that goblins are either lazy and unproductive, or too productive and end up killing themselves with their own explosives. Unfortunately for us, they're being motivated by the brilliant Chief Bombgineer Sploder. Get up to the Skunkworks on the west side of the refuge and don't come back until you have the Chief Bombgineer's head! "
203,To The Ramparts! ,Speak with Kulg Gorespatter at the Ashenvale/Azshara border to be transported to the Mor'shan Ramparts. ,"These woods may be silent but our enemies lurk behind every trunk. I've discovered many an orc with arrows in his back, his weapon still sheathed. It is treacherous here, behind the lines, but we could use strong arms and sharp minds down at the Mor'shan Ramparts. Kadrak is preparing an offensive from there - he prefers action to talk. You and he will get along. Speak with me when you are ready and I will fly you there. "
204,"Farewell, Minnow",Speak to Sorata Firespinner in Bilgewater Harbor. ,"Thank you, little one. Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the throes of love and lose sight of things, even as a dragon. I plan to rededicate myself entirely to making sure Kalec never steps up to take Malygos' place. It's the most noble cause I can think of. You should head back to the harbor. I believe someone's waiting for you there. Try not to get squashed or eaten by anything. "
205,The Trial of Fire,Complete the Trial of Fire by standing in the fire runes without getting hit by flame for 10 consecutive bursts. ,"The Trial of Fire. . . oooh. . . sounds intimidating, doesn't it? No? Hm. Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens. To beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win! There are little signs to help you - fire hopping to its new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do. "
206,Beating the Market,Track down a Bilgewater Foreman somewhere in Bilgewater Harbor and knock him around a little. ,"<It's not hard to see why the Foebreaker is behind schedule. Every other day, a foreman comes in and changes the blueprints. ><Most troubling are the recent alterations. The workers have been ordered to remove rivets to save on costs! ><You'd better track down one of the Bilgewater foremen responsible for this and make an example out of him, before any Horde lives are lost in a faulty ship. >"
207,Smoot's Samophlange,Find Smoot somewhere in Bilgewater Harbor. ,"It was the Captain who insisted his new engines use an induction samophlange. Those things hadn't even been invented yet! I tasked Smoot with creating one based on some stolen Venture Company schematics, and he's finally built a working model. Now that he's got his samophlange, he's drunk with power. He's running all over town with it like a goblin possessed. Smack Smoot and snag my samophlange, <name>. "
208,The Trial of Frost,Complete the Trial of Frost by gathering 20 Essence of Ice without getting hit by Frostburn. ,"You know, some of my apprentices have called me cold hearted. I always say though, I shall not let the temperature of my body parts stand in the way of true learning. To reach the Trial of Frost, touch the Frost crystal to open a portal. Once there, the goal is quite simple - gather the little floaty ice orb thingies. To counter the simple, the rotating Frostburns may put back your progress, as it were. If you want to be fancy, you can use the rune traps to jump over them as they rotate by. Neat, eh? "
209,The Blackmaw Doublecross,Wear the Ambassador Disguise and talk to Andorel Sunsworn to teleport into Blackmaw Hold. ,"Andorel here has crafted a little bit of magic for me. Come, stand next to my fire, and steep yourself in the fumes from the tea. Drape the robes around you and you'll take on the appearance of a night elven ambassador to the Blackmaw. Don your disguise and speak to Andorel here in camp. He'll teleport you to the heart of Blackmaw hold, where the negotiations are to take place. Speak with Chieftain Ungarl and sabotage the treaty. Then, kill as many Blackmaw as you can on the way back! "
210,Azsharite Experiment Number One,Grab a giant-sized laxative from the gnomish tower in the Ruined Reaches. ,"Well, I can think of one surefire way to send a giant running to the bathroom, but you're not going to like it. What we need is a. . . massive. . . laxative. Oh hey! Would you believe the gnomes have something of the sort? That can't be a coincidence. I wonder what they're trying to push through over there? Our intelligence reports that the laxative was delivered to Gadgetspring's tower, down on the shoreline south of the Secret Lab. Retrieve that laxative and feed it to Gormungan! "
211,Fade to Black,Kill Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion in Sable Ridge. ,"Now we put an end to all this madness. We need to rout the black dragonflight from Azshara entirely before they can return with any communication for their master. I still don't know what they have up their sleeve for capturing us, so I'd like to ask this one last thing of you - go into sable ridge and kill their leaders, Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion. If things get hairy, I will come help. I just don't want to risk falling into whatever trap they set for Azuregos. "
212,Ready the Air Force,Look for Fleep at her junkyard within Bilgewater Harbor in Azshara. ,"I gave Hellscream my personal guarantee that I'd have his airfleet ready this week, but our flagship - The Spear of Durotar - still doesn't have its primary engines installed. Fleep promised me a dangerously shiny new engine last week. Go to her junkyard behind the bank and find out what the holdup is. The airfleet is waiting on us, <name>! "
213,Wasn't It Obvious? ,Use the portal behind Joanna at Xylem's tower to find Anara the Spirit Healer and--hopefully--Azuregos. ,"Azuregos! Yes, of course. Troubled old dragon, but lovely heart. I don't think all the years of vagabonds assaulting him have done him much good. He's a mite strange these days. Not long ago, when returning yet again to our local Spirit Healer, Anara, I couldn't help but notice that her and Azuregos seemed to be hitting it off. I imagine he's still keeping her company. The portal behind me is probably the quickest way to reach her. It might sting a little though. "
214,Watch Your Step,Receive 6 Energized charges from the Energy Conduits as you ascend to the top of the Arcane Pinnacle. ,"This is somewhat simple and somewhat not simple. All the way up there are Energy Conduits. Rather like this one right here one might say! Indeed, I do say. Now for you. You must use my jump pads to ascend the pinnacle, and you must touch all of the conduits you see along the way. When you get to me at the top, you should be all juicy with energy, because really that's the only way to be. And be sure to keep moving or you're likely to be sent for quite a trip! "
215,The Terrible Tinkers of the Ruined Reaches,"Slay Bingham Gadgetspring in the Ruined Reaches, along with 4 Netgun Gnomes and 6 Zapper Gnomes. ","Scoundrels! Infidels! Ever since I started my operation here in Azshara the Gadgetspring family has hampered my studies and sabotaged my research. And now a mob of middling, second-rate tinkers have rallied to their aid! I have pressing business to attend to: see to it that those gnomes are finished for good. Head to the Ruined Reaches on the coast, south of my Secret Lab, and start rolling some of their disproportionately enormous heads for me. "
216,Trouble Under Foot,Use your Personal Arcane Assistant to turn 12 Legash demons into insects and then squash them. ,"Look at you. Doing errands. Quite responsible of you. You're moving up up up, you are. . . up up! There be demons ahead! Demons of many unpleasant kinds. Demons that would quite like your innards! Legash demons of a southeasternly heading! But do not worry. No no, no reason to worry, for I shall provide you with a companion! Point, bugify, squash. Point, bugify, squash! Quite efficient. Quite messy too. . . but again, worry not. No no, worry not, for afterwards, we don't have to clean up! "
217,Friends Come In All Colors,Locate Ergll on the coast of the Ruins of Arkkoran. ,"My brothers and I are being hunted. Our sire was recently killed and the black dragonflight seeks to rout those of us that still live. I'm here to find Azuregos and take him to safety, if only he would let it be that easy. Azuregos doesn't make many friends, and his taste in them tends to be a bit. . . unique. The only one I know of here is a murloc named Ergll. You should be able to find him on the coast northeast of here. Do whatever it takes to find Azuregos and send him to me. Please hurry. "
218,Runaway Shredder! ,Attack one of the Runaway Shredders near the rear gates of Orgrimmar and hop inside once it's been significantly damaged. ,"I've been trying to impress our new Horde allies with our legendary goblin efficiency, but in hindsight automating the shredders was a bad idea. Now they're mindless killing machines, rampaging over the countryside. Don't get me wrong - that kind of thing has its place - but for the time being I need a brave <class> to help me get these things under control. It's easy. Automated shredders, like all machines, must first be beaten into submission. Afterwards, seize the controls and I'll radio you instructions. "
219,Azshara Blues,Meet with Kalec in Bilgewater Harbor. ,"Hey! I'm glad I caught you. I come on behalf of my master, Kalec. He requires your aid. Find him under the bridge in the slums as soon as you can! "
220,Stone Cold,Collect a stonified Mountainfoot Miner from the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and bring him or her back to Horzak Zignibble at the Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange. ,"Workers act like it's their job to complain. If it isn't the backbreaking labor, the long hours, or the low pay, it's being turned to stone by basilisks. It's always something! But I'm thinking maybe this whole workers-to-stone business could be a big moneymaker for me. What if those guys are now high-quality stone? My whiny employees could be worth more to me as luxury building materials than a source of labor! Grab a stonified mountainfoot miner and haul him or her back to me. "
221,Raptor Raptor Rocket,Release five Experimental Raptors from their cages in the Secret Lab and deliver them to the rocket beside Subject Nine. ,"Shortly after my intellect was augmented, I bred with Subject Four in order to create a unique race of cognitively superior raptors. Subsequently, Subject Four neither called nor wrote: I have determined to disembowel him upon our next encounter. Nonetheless, there are enough raptor children imprisoned in this lab to provide adequate genetic stock for repopulating my race. Please release them from their cages and carry them to the rocket. "
222,Ready the Navy,Investigate the Hull of the Foebreaker. ,"Hellscream expects an armada of ships for his invasion, but the docks here are weeks behind schedule. Costs are rampant and quality is poor. Corruption is the problem, <name>! And I need you to root it out. The Foebreaker, a warship berthed at the northwest pier, should have been outfitted days ago. Something reeks. Go there and oversee the construction yourself. Find out who's disrupting our naval preparations and deal with them! "
223,Twilight Skies,Check in with Friz Groundspin at the Southern Rocketway Terminus in Azshara. ,"I just got word from Orgrimmar that the Warchief wants us to move out. We wouldn't have been ready if it wasn't for your help! The plan is for the air fleet to take off immediately, and for the navy to follow close behind. Hellscream will be accompanying the air fleet and specifically requested that you come along with us. No time to delay! Go to the Southern Rocketway Terminus here in Azshara, and check in with Friz Groundspin. I'll bring the zeppelin around to pick you up. "
224,First Degree Mortar,Use a Goblin Mortar to slaughter 60 Spitelash Attackers. ,"Hey bud! Like explosions? Of course you do. Who doesn't like explosions? ! I've got mortars set up on the ridge to the east to hold the naga back. Go forth, recruit. Mortar them. . . mortar them all! Ahahahah. "
225,Survey the Lakeshore,"Escort a Goblin Surveyor to the three pieces of Surveyor's Equipment that surround Lake Mennar, and defend her while she takes readings. ","All these cruddy ancient ruins have to be bulldozed if we're ever to see Azshara 's full potential. Look on my map here - you see Lake Mennar, to the East? I'll tell you what I see: a future rocket fuel depot! But we need an accurate lay of the land before we can clearcut, bulldoze, landfill, and pave over that lake. All of my surveyors have been spooked off by the oogly-boogleys haunting that area. Escort one of my Jr. grade surveyors to the area and take readings from the equipment that's been set up. "
226,There Are Many Like It,"Use a rocket to reach the Shattered Strand, and then report for duty to Lieutenant Drex. ","Enough small talk. Get off your butt and onto a rocket, soldier. And remember, you don't get paid if you're dead. "
227,Ticker Required,Bring Ticker into the ruins and cover him as he sets up bombs at 3 of the Spitelash Runestones. ,"Our best demo-man, Ticker, is on assignment with the Gob Squad. He's got WAY more than enough explosives for all the runestones in the ruins. All you have to do is get him there and keep him covered - he'll handle the rest. "
228,Azsharite Experiment Number Two,Speak with Assistant Greely to be shrunken down to rat-size. ,"Okay, new plan. We'll SCARE it out of 'em! In my experience most large creatures are terrified of tiny ones - like rats. Hmm. This place is crawling with rats, but how do we coax them over to the giant? Hey! You don't mind having your cellular matrix broken down and reassembled do you? It's only painful while it's happening. I can shrink you down to rat-sized and you can ride one of these brutes over there like a horse. It's so crazy it's got to work! Speak with me when you're ready for shrinkage. . . "
229,Mystery of the Sarcen Stone,Retrieve the Sarcen Stone from the bottom of Lake Mennar. ,"Before she died, Kalytha was charged with burying something at the bottom of the lake, a powerful artifact that the archmages of Mennar spent their last moments creating. No doubt Malynea Skyreaver will want to see the artifact, presuming it still exists. You resolve to search the bottom of Lake Mennar for the Sarcen Stone. "
230,The Conquest of Azshara,Slay Commander Jarrodenus in Talrendis Point and collect his head. ,"<name>! Was it you who piloted the wind rider who bombed the command center? It was a direct hit! My scouts tell me that you gravely wounded Jarrodenus, flight master of the night-elven skychasers and de facto commander of the opposition. The opportunity to strike is now - I don't have time to assemble a full assault. Rush the command center building and kill Commander Jarrodenus before his backup arrives. Bring me his head. . . and Azshara is ours! "
231,Airborne Again,Secure a ride to Valormok with the Airborne Priests in the eastern portion of Bilgewater Harbor. ,"We just got word from Valormok that we can't send anymore windriders that way unless we want them shot down by Talrendis snipers. We can't give up Valormok if we want a secure route to Ashenvale, so we're going in another way. The airborne priests have graciously offered to drop some people in for us from above sniper range. Head up to the military area and secure a ride on one of their planes. They'll get you there in one piece, and hopefully once you're there, you can resecure our windrider lines. "
232,Pre-Flight Checklist,Talk to Captain Krazz at Bilgewater Harbor in Azshara. ,"This new engine is extremely fast. And dangerous. I'd use the word ""volatile. ""That's the way the Captain likes it. Run back up the hill and let him know that I'll install this bad boy right now and that he should meet me at the construction site. "
233,Segmentation Fault: Core Dumped,Activate the Reactor Control Console and escort the Azsharite Core back to the Southern Rocketway Terminus. ,"Once we flush the central reactor, I need you to return the core to me. It's 100% refined azsharite crystal, which is both powerful and dangerous. And lovely. Oh precious azsharite, the shaper of worlds to come! The giant lever to your left will dump the core and send it to me via the rail system. The core will be superheated, so you'll need to periodically douse it with the Fireliminator on the way here. . . don't let it reach critical temperature! "
234,Another Warm Body,Report to Commander Molotov on Forlorn Ridge. ,"Oh have I got a deal for you! Immerse yourself in foreign cultures, go on epic adventures, blow things up, and get paid to do it! Sound too good to be true? Well it's not - this is what we do! If you're interested, head over to Gallywix Defense Post on Forlorn Ridge to the north and look for Commander Molotov. "
235,Blacken the Skies,Mount a Grounded Wind Rider and fly over Talrendis Point. ,"<name>! Give us a hand here, will ya? Gorsch here had a bad experience at the all-you-can-eat seafood joint back in town, and now we're short a pilot. My job was to take out those elven glaive throwers before they cut our air units to ribbons. Hop on this wind rider and take to the skies! One of my bombardier buddies will ride with you and bomb the targets at your command. And hey! Chuck a bomb straight at the night elven command center - the large building south of here, beside the bridge. Glorious! "
236,Basilisk Bashin',Kill 10 Greystone Basilisks in the Mountainfoot Strip Mine. ,"We moved this whole mountain to strip mine the minerals below. But what we didn't take into consideration were the subterranean basilisks that are now, uh, terranean. You look like you've got some initiative - go in there and kill some of those nuisances and I'll dip into our petty cash fund for you. "
237,Ice Cold,Use the Cryomatic 16 to freeze and kill 8 Sable Drakes. ,"I've got the perfect solution to our drake problem. My very own Cryomatic 16. I originally developed it to freeze my workers during transport and between shifts so that I wouldn't have to feed and entertain them, but there were. . . complications. It should be perfect for dropping these drakes out of the sky though! "
238,Wash Out,Speak to Sorata Firespinner at the Northern Rocketway Exchange. ,"Delicious! Azy always trying to get his hands on magic artifacts. Said he was trying to make friends with that archmage person. Xylem! Xylem has LOTS of apprentices. Takes in all kinds, burns'm out, leaves them wandering all over. High turnover. Last one was last night. Headed over towards that big goblin tower construction thing, way west. Maybe he'll help you meet Xylem? Maybe Xylem knows where Azy is? Play nice! "
239,Ready the Ground Troops,Search Bilgewater Harbor and convince 12 AWOL Grunts to report for duty. ,"It was a bad idea to muster the troops in this festering goblin metropolis. Every vice that coin can buy is within arm's reach. Our mighty veterans are running rampant, blowing years of Northrend back-pay in a city-wide debacle. Can you make a sweep through the city and gather up any stragglers that have gone AWOL? My axebite warriors are unmatched on the battlefield, but I won't have them disgrace their uniforms while on shore leave. "
240,The Trial of Shadow,Complete the Trial of Shadow by luring 20 Weeping Souls into the shadow runes without getting touched. ,"Let us not be confined by the bounds of the mage repertoire of magic. I, for one, choose not to be classist. Necromancy can just be so much fun! Touch the Shadow Crystal to open a portal to my Trial of Shadow. Once there, move to the Altar when you are ready to begin. Weeping Souls shall begin to pursue you. . . your goal is simply to drag them into the traps. And be sure not to let them touch you. "
241,Xylem's Asylum,Take the portal to Archmage Xylem's tower and seek out Joanna inside. ,"Quite marvelous of you! A pleasure to observe. Much to study. Off you go now, retire to my tower. Joanna will get you situated. I shall open a portal for you. "
242,Operation Fishgut,Report for active duty to Commander Molotov under the main cannon in Bilgewater Harbor. ,The Bilgewater Battalion are now accepting recruits for OPERATION FISHGUT. Wages will consist of 1 gold piece at the time of operation completion for all active soldiers in good standing. All wages will be forfeited in the event of death. A fee of 20 silver will be charged for any resurrections performed in the line of duty. All recruits are to report for duty directly to Commander Molotov under the main cannon. 
243,The Pinnacle of Learning,Speak to the Image of Archmage Xylem at the base of the Arcane Pinnacle. ,"This is so exciting! What's exciting you might ask? Well THIS is of course! Time to trial. . . time for YOU to trial. So many challenges to overcome, so much learning to be done. You learning about trials. Me learning about you. So now, off you go. To my Arcane Pinnacle. I will meet you there of course, because I'm quite everywhere. "
244,Beyond Durotar,Report to Ag'tor Bloodfist at the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Azshara. ,"Hmmph. . . it looks like your services are being requested elsewhere. Ag'tor Bloodfist is looking for recruits to assist the Horde's ventures in Azshara, north of Orgrimmar. I'm sure you still have work to do here in Durotar, and I understand that they'll shortly be asking for your help in the Barrens.  I wouldn't be going anywhere yet if I were you, but if you're itching for some manifest destiny. . . Azshara awaits. "
245,The Keystone Shard,Find the Keystone Shard nearby. ,"The air around this strange stone crackles with energy. The stone itself is smooth and icy cold. It pulses periodically as you run your hands over it, like the crashing of surf. A wedge-shaped piece appears to be missing from the top surface of the artifact. This ' keystone shard ' is likely the key to unlocking the secrets of the stone. Search the grounds near the temple and locate the keystone shard. "
246,The Captain's Logs,Use the Reprogrammed Shredder to collect 6 piles of Azshara Lumber. ,"Now that you've got that thing under control, let's gather up the lumber I was supposed to be collecting. Otherwise these orcs are going to build a catapult out of ME! Fresh lumber should be stockpiled all around the area. Use the shredder to collect all you can. "
247,Absorbent,Collect 20 Simmering Water Droplets from the Vile Splashes east of the Ruins of Arkkoran. ,"One other thing I need. Hot water. Not easy around here. Not hot springs, no friends to share. One good way though. Have this sponge. . . it's ultra absorbent! Use it to go soak Vile Splashes at the sandbar eastish. With enough, go squeeze them out over near the tower to summon jumbo elemental. He has hot water. "
248,Where's My Head? ,You've been sent to meet with the goblin assassin Slinky Sharpshiv at the base of the northern tower of Talrendis Point. ,"He's here, <name>! Captain Grunwald is a high-ranking Alliance officer from Northwatch Hold, no doubt here to coordinate an assault on Orgrimmar with his night elven allies. We have observed him entering the tower southwest of here. I want his head, <class>. I want to send it back to Northwatch to drive a wedge between our enemies! I've sent a goblin assassin, Slinky Sharpshiv, to the tower but she hasn't returned. Go find her. And get me that head! "
249,Befriending Giants,Talk to Gormungan outside of the Southern Rocketway Terminus and discover the secret of azsharite. ,"A cursory study of the azsharite you brought me reveals that it's not biological in nature, nor is it naturally formed. There's another creature in Azshara with similar properties: the cliff giants that lumber around these cliffs. One of the giants seems willing to help our research along. Take the meat you collected to Gormungan, the giant standing just west of here. Befriend him, then grill him - find out if he knows the secret of azsharite! "
250,Halo Drops,Call in Airborne Priests at the bodies of 8 Wounded Soldiers on the Shattered Strand. ,"We've got ""soldiers"" all over the beach trying to get out of their work by dying on us. Find the slackers and use this flaregun to call in a priest to take care of the situation. We can't have men thinking they can get off that easy. "
251,Military Breakthrough,Kill Warlord Krellian and recover the SFG. ,"We've lost contact with Sergeant Dynamo, stationed at the next ridge to the north of the central minefield. They were probably overrun. He had our last SFG. Go over there and get it back. Clear out any naga that have broken through while you're there. "
252,Handling the Goods,Collect 12 Highborne Tablets from the Ruins of Eldarath. ,"Hey there, buddy. Want to make a quick buck? Bring me back any highborne tablets you find in the ruins. "

Get back here right away. Hurry back to the gates - we're under attack! Help us fend off the invaders. I'm arming your grenade launcher! ! "
254,Dozercism,"Use the Blessed Flare Gun near Clubnik's Dozer to summon in help, then 'Exorcise' the bulldozer. ",". . . what we need is a priest! Fortunately I have a small budget set aside for the blessing of machinery. Take this flare gun and head over to Margene, my poor sweet busted bulldozer. Fire off the signal and one of our finest airborne priests should airdrop in to get a handle on the situation. Come back when my bulldozer is taken care of! "
255,Waste of Thyme,Collect 8 bundles of Living Ire Thyme near the Ruins of Nordressa. ,"Living Ire Thyme. I must have more! Be quick about it, will you? "
256,Mysterious Azsharite,Collect 5 Azsharite Samples from the nearby cliffs. ,"Azsharite! This mysterious crystalline substance has been used to forge weapons of fel power, but in our hands, we've discovered that it's capable of focusing enormous amounts of energy. It may be the biggest goblin discovery since kaja'mite. But what is it? Where does it come from? Why is it located only here? Science demands an answer! I need more samples to study. Search out Azsharite deposits all along the nearby cliffs. "
257,Arborcide,Use the Shredder to destroy the Talrendis Ancient. ,"How's that shredder holding up? I think I can bring your emergency power supplies online - that'll recharge you when you're wounded. Listen, these night elves are being strengthened by an ancient of war who's taken root just west of the gates. He's a big, giant tree. You know what to do! Take him out! You were made for this! ! "
258,Return of the Highborne? ,Deliver the Scout's Orders to Ag'tor Bloodfist at the rear gate to Orgrimmar. ,"The wax seal on these orders has been freshly broken. You can't read the carefully-penned night elven script, but a small hand-drawn map indicates the nearby ruins. Underneath the map, written in a different language entirely, are a series of runes penned in a metallic, shimmering ink. Ag'tor will no doubt want to see this important piece of intelligence. "
259,A Little Pick-me-up,Collect 10 Kawphi Beans from the plants in the Ruins of Arkkoran. ,"Azuregos. . . Azuregos. Azy? The dragon? We're friends, definitely! Taught me to speak. Said he liked my hue. . . kinda colorist, eh? Don't remember where he went. Mmm. . . maybe something to help my memory? I plant Kawphi plants all over the beach. They like sand. Kinda weird. Could you go collect some? "
260,Memories of the Dead,Take Kalytha's Ring to the shores of Lake Mennar. ,"The runes on this ring you found are still legible: it was given to ""Kalytha"" when she was granted admission to the Academy. With the right spell or two, this personal trinket of hers is the gateway to her soul. Take the ring back to Lake Mennar. Kalytha's spirit should now be visible to you on the shore of the lake. Touch her and the ring will allow you to see the world as she sees it, forever reliving her final hours. Probe her mind, <name>! Speak to the others and learn the secrets of Lake Mennar. . . "
261,Profitability Scouting,Use the stealth field generator to infiltrate the Ruins of Eldarath and identify the Heart of Arkkoroc. ,"Things seem to be quieting down a bit. Gallywix will probably keep forking out cash to keep us posted here, but I have a feeling we might be able to milk a bit more out of the deal. Naga and Sea Giants aren't normally friends, so the naga must be controlling them somehow. Take this stealth field generator, get in those ruins, and let me know if you find something that looks really pricey. "
262,Renewable Resource,Use the Arcane Charge to retrieve 5 Animate Basalt from Balboa near the Ruins of Nordressa. ,"We're going to need some more animate basalt. There's only one reliable source for that in the area, a mountain giant named Balboa. We can't be killing the mountain giant if we want to keep stocked in the stuff long term, so we've just been chipping off pieces at a time. You'll be able to see his path northeast and east of here. Find him, place the charge ahead on the path, and then hide until it goes off. Once he's cleared the area, you should be able to retrieve the basalt and bring it back to me. "
263,Sisters of the Sea,Kill Lady Silisthra and Lady Vesthra by disabling their power stones. ,"Two Naga witches have been masterminding the assault on this outpost. They've repelled direct attacks from some of my best grunts, but you can finish the job where others have failed. Seek out and slay Lady Silisthra and Lady Vesthra at the eastern edge of the cliffs, around the ruins of the ancient night elven colossus. You will first need to destroy the powerstones that give them their strength. Do not disappoint me, <class>! "
264,Extermination,Kill 30 Spitelash Naga in the Ruins of Eldarath. ,"We're sending you in there to clean up this naga infestation. Lethal force has been authorized. Gob Squad will be backing you up on this one, so it should be a cakewalk. "
265,A Quota to Meet,Gather 20 ingots of Mountainfoot Iron from the Mountainfoot Strip Mine in Azshara. ,"Mountainfoot iron is a brittle alloy, but with the right bribes it meets goblin safety standards. Zignibble here is having trouble on the production end of things, but that doesn't change any of my deadlines. I've got a quota to fill! Head down into the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and gather up any ingots of Mountainfoot iron you find. There should be piles of it smelted and ready for shipment. "
266,Investigating the Sea Shrine,Investigate the Naga shrine for Torg Twocrush. ,"The Naga invaders have set up a series of shrines along the cliffs. I don't know their purpose, <name>, but I believe they're strengthening our foes. I need someone to get in there and root out this threat. One nearby shrine is lightly defended: Cross the first bridge east of here and then head north towards the bay. You'll find it on a small outcropping. Investigate that shrine and come back with some info I can use. "
267,That's Just Rude! ,Kill 10 Makrinni in the Ruins of Arkkoran. ,I'd share if they asked. They just go clickity-claking up my kawphi plants. So rude! You should teach them a lesson. Dumb Makrinni. 
268,To Gut a Fish,Slay 6 Spitelash Stormfuries and 6 Spitelash Seacallers. ,"It tries my patience, defending against creatures who can disappear into the sea at will and emerge where they please. But I will not back down until their like has been wiped from Azshara. Spitelash Naga have slithered up the cliff walls and are besieging this post from the east. Destroy them, <name>. Gut them head to tail, so that they may know the full fury of my Horde. "
269,Easy is Boring,Convince Azuregos to return to the world of the living and rendezvous with Kalecgos. ,"After a long search with some questionable turns, you've finally found Azuregos. Now it's just a matter of convincing him to meet up with Kalecgos and put an end to the threat of the black dragonflight in Azshara. "
270,Hand-me-downs,Retrieve 12 Military Supply Packs from the central minefield. ,"First things first - we need more supplies for you and the other new recruits. There are some perfectly good standard issue packs on the bodies of our last round of recruits, in the minefield to the north. Taking their lessons to heart, I'd recommend you avoid stepping on mines yourself. "
271,Commando Drop,Slay 5 Talrendis Lorekeepers and locate a Lorekeeper Summoning Stone somewhere within Talrendis Point. ,"Are you sensitive to the tremors of the local ley-lines, <name>? I can feel the occasional thrum, like the plucking of a string. It's the kind of resonance I'd expect from a long-range summoning spell. The Lorekeepers in Talrendis, with their laughably primitive magics, are trying to summon in backup from Darnassus. We can use this to our advantage, <name>. If you can compromise their summoning stone, we can teleport a crack team of commandos behind enemy lines. Locate the summoning stone in Talrendis! "
272,Dressed to Impress,Put on your new wizard hat and then speak to the Image of Archmage Xylem just northeast of the Northern Rocketway Exchange. ,"Every man's got to learn his own lessons I suppose. Here, take my wizard hat. I have no doubt that he'll take you on as an apprentice if you look the role. . . you just might have to jump through some hoops first. Tiny flaming hoops, suspended over spikes, with spinning blades on the other side. You should be able to find an image of Xylem on top of that hill to the northeast. "
273,Shore Leave,Bring the Heart of Arkkoroc to Uncle Bedlam in Bilgewater Harbor. ,"We're looking pretty good here at this point. It's definitely been a pleasure working with you, soldier. If you're ready to take the artifact back, we've got a Gyrocopter ready to take you back to Bilgewater Harbor so that you can deliver it to Uncle Bedlam personally. "
274,Turning the Tables,"Speak to Anara to return to the world of the living, then meet with Kalecgos at the Northern Rocketway Terminus. ","Azuregos and Kalecgos are due to meet up at the Northern Rocketway Terminus. You should meet with them there to make sure that Kalecgos doesn't require any additional help. Should you prefer to not be dead, Anara will likely be able to help. "
275,A Thousand Stories in the Sand,Collect 5 Recovered Artifacts from the ruins around Lake Mennar in Azshara. ,"The ruins around Lake Mennar, to our east, have a tale to tell. The lesser races - like those clumsy dwarves - would go after the truth with picks and shovels. <Malynea wrinkles her nose. > We'll be using more elegant methods. My scrying magic is somewhat rusty, but with the right trinket I should be able to peer through the shrouds of time. The bones of my forefathers have long since rotted away but some of their personal treasures may remain - bring me some. "
276,Pro-liberation,Use Ironwrought Keys from cultists and dragonkin to free 4 Goblin Workers in Sable Ridge. ,I knew these guys would be trouble as soon as we started building this tower. Scoffing our bribes. Stealing our workers. Labor isn't cheap with all the construction in Azshara. I need those men back! 
277,In The Face! ,Use an SFG to kill an Enslaved Son of Arkkoroc in the southern minefield. ,The naga are using those giants to stamp paths through our minefields. Time to put that SFG to use! Head over to the entrance to the southern minefield - I think you can figure out the rest. 
278,Full of Hot Water,Obtain a Globe of Boiling Water from a Scalding Water Lord at the Tower of Eldara. ,"Ergll indicated that you should be able to use the Engorged Azshara Sea Sponge to summon a ""jumbo"" elemental near the Tower of Eldara to the northeast. "
279,Shear Will,Obtain 80 Pristine Thunderhead Feathers from the Hippogryphs near the Ruins of Nordressa. ,"I'd be amazing! At archmagery. Amazing! He won't even talk to me because I don't have a stupid robe and hat. Pffft. The most amazing archmage this land has ever seen can't just have any robe and hat. I need to show him that I'm something special, and I know just how to do it. Go out there and kill some of those hippogryph things. Bring me back a TON of feathers. You heard me! A whole bunch of feathers! Go go, I'll have the robe ready for them by the time you get back. "
280,Report to Twocrush,Return to Torg Twocrush at the Southern Rocketway Terminus in Azshara with news of your discovery. ,"A magical barrier pulses around you, chilling your bones. You feel secure behind this enchanted wall. Torg Twocrush will want to know what you've discovered here! "
281,Private Chat,Speak to Private Worcester at the Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange. ,"Look. . . one last favor before you run off. Private Worcester is still back at that tower ""recruiting. "" Go and let him know that we're good to pack it up now. Back to town. Pleasure working with you, recruit. "
282,Report to the Labor Captain,Report to Labor Captain Grabbit at the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Azshara. ,Your people are working on the terraforming of Azshara. The land will be remade in the image of the Horde so that all will know that Kalimdor belongs to us! Go north through the city. On the far side of the Valley of Honor you will find the Orgrimmar Rear Gate. Report to Labor Captain Grabbit outside the gates. For the Horde! ! ! 
284,Mortar the Point,Collect 5 Goblin Mortar Shells from the Secret Lab complex in Azshara. ,"The Naga started making a move on the peninsula here after we finished building this rocketway terminal. But there's no problem in this world that can't be solved with gratuitous firepower! That's what my daddy used to say. Before the accident. I'm running short on supplies, though. Do me a favor and collect the mortar shells I left stockpiled in the Secret Lab just west of here. Keep me supplied and I'll let you call in the artillery strikes! "
285,A Gigantic Snack,Collect 8 Mutilated Mistwing Carcasses from Mistwing Cliffdwellers. ,"While you're here running around the cliffs, perhaps you can help me with another line of investigation. The giants who walk these cliffs have been here since these mountains formed. Maybe they know where the Azsharite comes from? It's in our best interest to befriend these giants and find out. Gather up a gigantic meal for me as a peace offering! Kill the mistwing cliffdwellers that have been such a nuisance to our studies and collect their carcasses for me. "
286,Push the Button! ,Detonate the explosives! A level 5 Azshara Quest. ,"Lemme check the connections. . . and we're set. You do the honors, <name>. Push it. Push the button! Push the button, <name>! After the fireworks, go tell Kroum back at Valormok that his skies are clear. Push the button! "
287,Nine's Plan,Acquire the Secret Rocket Plans from the Laboratory Archives building at the eastern end of the Secret Lab. ,"My benefactors used their diminutive intellect to construct an interplanetary transport. As designed, this so-called ""Rocket"" is a death trap. But I suspect a simple re-engineering of the fuel catalyst semifold would render a stable mixture, providing a breathable oxygen byproduct. To implement such changes, I require the original engineering plans. Locate the Laboratory Archives and ring the doorbell to gain entry. The plans will be held by the lab director himself, presuming he still lives. "
288,Up a Tree,"Use the shredder's buzzsaw to cut down Azshara Saplings, and kill 9 Talrendis Snipers as they emerge. ","Hold still a second, I'm going to bring your main buzzsaw controls online. Night elven snipers from Talrendis have been hiding in the trees, taking potshots at my workers. I want you to take care of those snipers. . . by first taking care of those trees. Look for Azshara saplings east of the main gates. Your shredder will know what to do. Chop to it! "
289,Manual Labor,Retrieve the Abjurer's Manual from the Lagash Encampment. ,"The local demons seem to get quite a kick out of stealing all of our arcane manuals. I highly doubt most of them can even read, so they're probably doing it just to spite us. I could care less about most of the books they've taken, but they took an Abjurer's Manual that I'm going to need if there's any hope of keeping apprentices like you alive amidst Xylem's ""trials. "" Find the demons at the Lagash Encampment to the southeast and retrieve the Abjurer's Manual. That's all. Scoot. "
290,When Science Attacks,Use the Fireliminator X-21 to extinguish 8 fires and to rescue 6 Research Interns from the inferno at the Secret Lab. ,"Did you see the explosions on the way in? The Secret Lab is engulfed in flames! Again! If we don't stamp out those flames we're going to hit critical temperatacity and resonate into a meltdown cascade. Here, I'm entrusting you with a canister of experimental hypercooled pressurized liquigel: The most volatile fire retardant known to science! (Keep that canister away from open flame. ) Put out the fires and hose down my interns, then contact me via the squawkbox in central control. "
292,Mop Up,Kill 12 Spitelash Naga on the Shattered Strand. ,"There are a lot of naga left on this beach. Looks like you have some wet work ahead of you, <son/girl>. "
293,Refleshification,Use The Refleshifier to de-stonify eight Mountainfoot Miners within the Mountainfoot Strip Mine. ,"<The nearby radio calls out to you. >Hey <name>, you got that gun? Good! Don't point it directly at your eye. Aim that baby at my stonified workers and the refracted light should reverse the petrification process. Or it will melt them. Whatever. Return my workers to a state of profitability! And if the refleshification process makes them crazy-go-nuts, they should be killed for insurance purposes. Horzak OUT! "
294,Head of the Snake,Kill Lord Kassarus in the Temple of Zin-Malor. ,"They taught us at officers camp to always cut off the head of the snake. Seemed dumb considering we never fought any snakes, but I guess it kind of makes sense now. Take your men in there and kill Lord Kassarus. "
295,The Eyes of Ashenvale,Kill 8 Talrendis Scouts. ,"Our enemies abound, <class>, even here at our very doorstep. The night elves have reinforced Talrendis Point in an attempt to stop our advance into Ashenvale. As we speak, their scouts patrol the nearby hills, reporting every movement to and from these gates. We must remove these eyes of Ashenvale. Go. Your prey stalks all around these gates, especially to the east. Slay the scouts who shadow us! "
296,Prismbreak,Take the Crystal Pendant to the Weapons Cabinet in the Mountainfoot Strip Mine Headquarters. ,"If that prism of yours is tuned to refract a basilisk's gaze, we can use its crystal properties to reverse the process. All we need is a source of power. In the weapons cabinet to your right, you'll find our prototype laser mining drill. I loved that thing but the near daily dismemberments got to be a real bother. Grab the laser drill and swap out the lens with that crystal of yours. . . "
297,Warchief's Command: Azshara! ,Report to Labor Captain Grabbit at the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Azshara. ,All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Ag'tor Bloodfist at the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Azshara. Aid in driving back the encroaching Alliance forces and assist in securing Azshara for the glory of the Horde! Depart Orgrimmar through its northern gate to reach the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Azshara. Destiny calls! 
298,Lightning Strike Assassination,Talk to Slinky Sharpshiv to ascend the tower and assassinate Captain Grunwald. ,"The base of the tower is patrolled by the Captain's elite guards. So here's what we're going to do: we're going to grapple straight up to the top, slice-and-dice the VIPs, and bail out using my portable low-altitude parachute. I'll rig the tower to explode behind us. You be sure to grab Captain Grunwald's head for Chawg. Got it? Do NOT accept this mission unless you are prepared for UNMITIGATED BADASSERY. Is that clear? "
299,Rigged to Blow,Arm the three Explosive Charges located around the base of the southern-most tower at Talrendis Point. ,"This tower was out of cannon range, so I thought we'd blow it up the old-fashioned way - in person. We set all the main charges but the guards fought us back before we could arm the detonators. <name>! Get up there and arm the three detonators we placed around the base of the tower. Those things are wired into a pack of thermals I set up along the spine. . . It'll be some show! "
300,Still Beating Heart,Recover the Heart of Arkkoroc from the center of the Ruins of Eldarath. ,"Commander Molotov found a party at the Secret Lab willing to act as buyer for the artifact that you scouted out earlier. Undoubtedly, it's still in the center of the ruins with the High Priestess, where you initially spotted it. Get it back here undamaged, soldier. "
301,Field Promotion,Report to Captain Tork at the forward post in the Ruins of Eldarath. ,"Commander Molotov sent word directly that you should be dispatched to our forward post. We're preparing to send squads into the ruins to rout the naga and recover the artifact, and he would like you to lead one of them. Get to the northwest corner of the beach and follow the path up to our forward post. "
303,Bandits! ,Take the Blood Elf Communication to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch. ,"This appears to be a bounty ledger. You cannot understand the blood elf language but you note that there is a picture depicting a dead draenei, a smiling blood elf standing over the corpse, and a symbol of what you think is some sort of blood elf currency. They've put a hit out on draenei! You must inform the exarch. "
304,Gurf's Dignity,Return Gurf's Dignity to Gurf at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle. ,"You recover the piece of fur that Gurf had ""lost"" in his struggle with the murlocs. Return the fur to Gurf and let him know that the fearsome Murgurgula has been slain. "
305,Show Gnomercy,"Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing wants you to recover the Traitor's Communication from Engineer ""Spark"" Overgrind. ","Spark must be brought to justice! I need you to go down to the beach and find that deceitful gnome. Once you find him, get whatever information you can out of him! If a high ranking official of the Alliance has committed treasonous acts, who knows how many others are corrupt? And <name>, use force if you have to. . . "
306,All That Remains,Cowlen on Azuremyst Isle wants you to recover the Remains of Cowlen's Family. ,"We had lived peacefully among the Owlbeasts of this island for many years. You can imagine my surprise when they stormed the beach and attacked us. I fought tooth and nail but was easily overpowered. As I blacked out from the vicious blows that I had been dealt, I prayed that my family not suffer. When I awoke, all was quiet. The sand was soaked red with blood - their blood. They were devoured whole. I care not for vengeance, <name>. I only ask that their remains be returned to me for proper burial. "
307,Learning the Language,Read the Stillpine Furbolg Language Primer that Aurren gave you and interact with the Totem of Akida at Azure Watch. ,"I think I've cracked it, <name>! <Aurren points to the totem. >All that we need to know about the Stillpine furbolg language is imprinted on their totems. With just a rudimentary understanding of how their symbols work, we can study the totems and learn to communicate with the furbolgs. I've written down the basics of the symbol matrix on this parchment. Study it and then examine the totem. It should lead you to the next language totem. Speak to Arugoo when you return an educated <race>! "
308,A Hearty Thanks! ,Speak with Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch. ,"You saved my life, <name>! Thank you so much! That beast would have torn me to shreds if it weren't for you. If you see the exarch at Azure Watch, tell him of what you did. I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear such news! "

310,The Great Moongraze Hunt,Bring 6 Moongraze Stag Tenderloins to Acteon at Azure Watch. ,"You're starting to make a name for yourself, <name>. How about trying your hand at hunting? Back on Draenor, our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a talbuk. If you think yourself draenei enough, go out into the wilds and kill enough stags to fill your pack with meat. You will find them grazing south of Azure Watch. Watch out for their horns! "
311,Reclaiming the Ruins,"Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill 5 Wrathscale Myrmidons, 5 Wrathscale Naga and 5 Wrathscale Sirens. ","While some may look at our current predicament as an unfortunate turn of events, I sense that we are here for a reason. The invisible hand of fate has pushed us in this direction. The reason why will become evident in time. To the west lies an ancient night elf city, now in ruin and overrun with naga. It would be remiss of me to sit idly by as the naga tainted my ancestral lands. You have shown yourself a capable <class>. Honor my people and cleanse the ruins of their unwelcome inhabitants. "
312,The Kurken's Hide,Deliver the Kurken's Hide to Moordo at Stillpine Hold. ,"Take the Kurken's hide to Moordo, on the other side of the village. He will fashion the hide into an item of your choice. "
313,A Cry For Help,Escort Magwin through the island to her home. ,"My family was attacked by the murlocs and owlkin of this island several weeks ago. I managed to escape but I think that both my mother and father have been slain. I don't know what I'm going to do now, but I must try and get back to my home - or what's left of it. . . Will you help me get through the forest? "
314,Word from Azure Watch,Speak with Caregiver Chellan at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle. ,"<class>! A couple mutated beasts jumped me and my leg is injured. I was sent on a scouting mission from Azure Watch after we received word from Zhanaa. Please, could you go speak with Caregiver Chellan in my stead? She needs to know how many people to expect in Azure Watch. Just cross the Crystalbrook River here and continue following the road until you get to Azure Watch. Be sure to ask her for a place for yourself to stay in. "
315,The Kurken is Lurkin',Kurz the Revelator at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill the Kurken and bring back the Kurken's Hide. ,"After the crystal storm had subsided, a beast of myth appeared in our village. Brought here by the invading wildkin, this beast, the Kurken, laid waste to our village. Many Stillpine were slain in defense of our lands by this fiend and many have since lost their lives attempting to subdue the beast. In my visions, I have seen one defeat the Kurken. The one must be you, <name>. You are our only hope. Enter Stillpine Hold and slay the Kurken. Bring me his hide as proof of deed. "
316,Search Stillpine Hold,Search Stillpine Hold for clues. ,"As High Chief, my immediate concern is the root of the corruption in Stillpine Hold. Why did the wildkin - once our allies - attack us? Why have they taken residence in Stillpine Hold? Perhaps something inside will hold the answer. Search Stillpine Hold for clues as to the source of corruption. "
317,The Great Moongraze Hunt,Bring 6 Moongraze Buck Hides to Acteon at Azure Watch. ,"Well done, <name>! Well done! Now that you've cut your teeth with the moongraze stag, it's time you graduated to more formidable prey. Do not allow the casual disinterest of the moongraze bucks to fool you: when provoked, they are a fearsome foe. You'll find the bucks north of here. Good hunting. "
318,Red Snapper - Very Tasty! ,Use the Draenei Fishing Net to catch 10 Red Snappers. ,"I've found that these waters are bustling with red snapper, a very tasty fish. With a fishing net, I can catch enough to feed dozens of draenei! Unfortunately, I was recently attacked by a creature known as a murloc while netting in the river and have suffered some injuries that prevent me from doing my job. I need help! Use this fishing net near schools of red snapper, found in the Crystalbrook river to the east, to catch the fish. What do you say? Remember to return the net when you are finished. "
319,Murlocs. . . Why Here? Why Now? ,Gurf at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to recover 5 sacks of Stillpine Grain. ,"These are dark days, Promised One. Even the murlocs are kicking our tails - literally. Unfortunately, more than just my ego has been bruised. While our relationship with the Siltfin murlocs had always been tenuous, never could we have imagined that they would have the gall to attack us and steal from our food stores! Travel west to the Silting Shore and recover our stolen food-stuffs! And if you see a dark-skinned murloc with a patch of white fur stuck in between his webbed toes. . . "
320,An Alternative Alternative,Daedal at Azure Watch wants you to bring him 5 Azure Snapdragon Bulbs. ,"The girl is too far gone for mere ointments to be effective. There may be another way. . . The forest of Azuremyst holds many secrets, one of those being a rare plant known as the azure snapdragon that some claim to be a panacea - a cure all. You can identify the plant by its stark contrast to the other plants of Azuremyst and its need to grow at the base of the azure pine trees. Make haste! And <name>, be wary of the root threshers of the region as they consume snapdragon for sustenance. "
321,Blood Crystals,Speak with High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold. ,"On the surface, the crystal appears to be a piece of the Exodar. Something has gone terribly wrong with this crystal, however, as it is blood red and rapidly dissolving into the water supply of the cave. This may explain the unusually aggressive behavior of the creatures in Azuremyst. Return to High Chief Stillpine with this information. "
322,Learn to Ride at the Exodar,Return this pamphlet to Aalun outside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle. ,This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Aalun. Aalun can be found at the entrance to the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle. 
323,Beasts of the Apocalypse! ,Moordo at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him 8 Ravager Hides. ,"My brother and I were hunting in the woods to the east when we were ambushed by strange, insect-like beasts. Such aberrations have never before been seen in Azuremyst! Could they be a sign of the coming apocalypse? The apocalypse that YOU are destined to prevent? If you truly are the Promised One, you will strike the creatures of the apocalypse down. . . and bring me their hides. From their hides, I can fashion armor of great power! Find them to the east, beyond the road. "
324,Medicinal Purpose,Anchorite Fateema at Azure Watch wants you to bring her 8 Root Trapper Vines. ,"I have found that lashers milling about on the island hold restorative medicinal properties in their vines. Through proper treatment, the vines can be broken down into a powerful healing ointment. Unfortunately, with so many injured draenei passing through Azure Watch, we are always in short supply. Our delicate guest was found injured and unconscious by the Crystalbrook only yesterday. If you bring me vines, we may be able to save her. You will find root trappers both south and east of Azure Watch. "
325,Warlord Sriss'tiz,Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill Warlord Sriss'tiz. ,"A naga invasion would be disastrous, <name>. I've seen what naga can do and I would not want to see such a catastrophe befall any being. If I were to guess, this Warlord Sriss'tiz will be hidden in a cave - probably along the coast to the west. Find Warlord Sriss'tiz and put an end to his reign. "
326,Precious and Fragile Things Need Special Handling,Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him 8 Ancient Relics. ,"The priestess tells me that the ruins to the west are what's left of a night elf civilization. That got me thinking about what my pappy used to always say about night elf ruins, ""Sonny, whenever you see night elf ruins, night elf relics are sure to be close by. ""Now what kind of a dwarf would I be if I didn't hire the first person I saw to go digging up night elf relics for me? Now get going! "
327,A Small Start,Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing wants you to recover the Nautical Compass and Nautical Map stolen by the Venture Co. ,"I am Admiral Odesyus of Alliance Naval Command. Our ship was forced to port on your island due to an infestation of sorts. It's embarrassing to even talk about, but goblins somehow managed to stow away in the holds of both of my ships. Last night, while most of the ship's crew was asleep below deck, they struck! Stranger still, they took our navigation gear and jumped ship! They disappeared into the thicket, east of here. Will you go in search of our gear? It will make for a strong gesture. "
328,Deliver Them From Evil. . . ,Deliver the Traitor's Communication to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch. ,"You must get this information to your people, <name>. While your brave acts have certainly slowed down the plans of Kael'thas and his dark master, the attacks will undoubtedly continue. Take the traitor's communication to your leaders. They must see this for themselves. Perhaps they will be able to better understand some of what was written. "
329,The Prophecy of Akida,Free 8 Stillpine Captives from cages found in Bristlelimb Village. ,"The images on this totem depict a war between the Stillpine and the Bristlelimb furbolg tribes. The etchings show that the Bristlelimb have done unconscionable things to the furbolgs of Stillpine. Amidst the chaos, a prophecy has begun to unfold: A hero will rise - not of furbolg blood - and save the Stillpine tribe. Slay Bristlelimb furbolgs at Bristlelimb Village for their keys. Use the keys to free the Stillpine captives. Return to Arugoo of the Stillpine when you have freed them all! "
330,The Prophecy of Velen,Daedal wants you to travel south and seek out the people that the injured creature mentioned. ,"The Prophet spoke of this day: That on this island, in this new world, our allies would find us. ""We will be tested. They will ask that we pay for the sins of our fathers. . . ""At the time, I did not understand the meaning behind his words, but seeing this creature and her reaction to us, it is now coming into focus. The corruption of our people has been felt even here. Venture south. It is there that we found this being. Find its kin and tell them of our people. "
331,Rune Covered Tablet,Take the Rune Covered Tablet to Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle. ,You cannot make out any of the symbols on the tablet. Perhaps the priestess would be able to decipher the mysterious runes. 
332,Totem of Vark,Find the Totem of Vark using the clues provided to you. ,"You no longer see unrecognizable symbology in the totems. The totem of Yor reads to you just as easily as your native tongue. The markings identify another furbolg den, due west of here. You are able to expertly decipher the language on the totem and know that your destination is Bristlelimb Village. Yor will guide you but if you get lost, you know that you are able to take the ancient elven road in the forest leading west to reach your destination. "
333,Find Acteon! ,Deliver the Crate of Red Snapper to Acteon at Azure Watch. ,"You did a wonderful job, <name>. Our people will be thankful for this bounty. With that said, would you mind taking this haul of red snapper to Acteon at Azure Watch? He shouldn't be hard to find as he is awaiting this catch. "
334,Tree's Company,Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to observe the meeting that is to take place between Geezle and the traitor. ,"According to the plans, the traitor and the leader of the goblins, Geezle, are to meet at a cove on the western island. I need you to be at that meeting, <name>. Remember the tree and leaves? You're going to wear them! It's a perfect disguise. Go to the cove and look for a naga flag. If the flag is there, it means a meeting is planned. Use the disguise kit when you see the flag and wait. Eventually the traitor will show up. Let the meeting finish then return to me with the identity of the scoundrel. "
335,Chieftain Oomooroo,Stillpine the Younger at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to slay Chieftain Oomooroo and 9 Crazed Wildkin. ,"I am Stillpine the Younger, heir to the Stillpine legacy. As you can see, my defenders have set up a death trap for the raving wildkin that attack from inside Stillpine Hold. While we are able to hold them off out here, none of my defenders have been able to infiltrate the hold. If you could get inside and slay their leader, it might give us an opportunity to strike! Find Chieftain Oomooroo and destroy him. Slay any crazed wildkin that you encounter inside as well. "
336,"Nightstalker Clean Up, Isle 2. . . ",Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch has asked that you slay 8 Infected Nightstalker Runts. ,"I'm not going to make any excuses for what you've found. This is clearly our fault. We had gotten reports of crushed crystal fragments showing up in the river to the east but chose to ignore the implications. Now we can either sit around on this island and cry about the tragedy that has befallen this land or we can do something about it and prevent it from spreading. If you've got the stomach for it, I want you to go back into the wilds and kill as many of the infected nightstalkers as you can find. "
337,Return to Caregiver Chellan,Speak with Stephanos to purchase a hippogryph ride back to Azure Watch. ,"If I remember correctly, Azure Watch's hippogryph master is Zaldaan.  If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him. That's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there. Since you arrived on one of Zaldaan's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to Azure Watch with the caregiver's supplies. "
338,Cookie's Jumbo Gumbo,"""Cookie"" McWeaksauce at the Odesyus' Landing wants you to bring him 6 Skittering Crawler Meat. ","The Admiral be right, ye are a resourceful one. Mayhap ye could help Cookie out? If I serve the crew chicken for dinner again, I'll be sent to the brig fer sure. I noticed that thar be crawlers all along the coastline - lots o' crawlers! Bring me crawler meats and I'll be forever indebted to ya. Help a reformed pirate out? "
339,"Beds, Bandages, and Beyond",Take Chellan's List to the hippogryph master Zaldaan at Azure Watch. ,"Welcome to Azure Watch, <class>. Please excuse the disorder you see around you. It's easy to take simple things for granted, like a fully furnished and stocked inn, until you're forced to build one from nothing. We've managed to salvage this pod for a building, but without the proper furnishings and first aid supplies, the inn is little more than a glorified tent. Nurguni at the Exodar has offered to put together a package to help with our most immediate needs, but I need someone to deliver this list to him. "
340,Strange Findings,Deliver the Faintly Glowing Crystal to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch. ,The crystal you found on the nightstalker runt's body appears to be a piece of the Exodar. This may help explain the unusual appearance and demeanor of some of the animals in this region. Take the crystal back to Azure Watch. The exarch will surely want to know about this discovery. 
341,Totem of Tikti,Find the Totem of Tikti using the clues provided to you. ,"You begin to read the totem, better able to pronounce the words and phrases. Words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go across the Crystalbrook river to the east. Perhaps your destination is on the other side of the river. "
342,Hippogryph Master Stephanos,Find Stephanos at the Seat of the Naaru inside the Exodar and purchase a hippogryph ride back to Azure Watch. ,"Here's the box, <name>. That should be enough for Chellan to get the inn up and running. Let her know that she can keep sending in orders as the need arises. Azure Watch urgently needs a place to care for the wounded and put up any travelers they receive. When you're ready to return to Azure Watch, seek out Stephanos near the Seat of the Naaru in the Exodar. "
343,Warn Your People,Speak with Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch. ,"The Hold is saved and soon my people will make their way back to the ancestral home. The prophecy has come to pass and a new age of prosperity begins for the Stillpine. But I fear that darkness looms ahead for your own people. There are questions left unanswered - visions of prophecy unseen. Return to your leaders and tell them of what you have seen here. And Promised One, should you ever require the aid of Stillpine, you have merely to ask. "
344,I've Got a Plant,Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him a Hollowed Out Tree and 5 Piles of Leaves. ,"I've wondered about this for some time now, but this proves it to be true. There is a traitor among us. The plans left behind by the goblins document the conspiracy. Since I don't know who it could be, I'm going to need your help in finding the traitor. None of my crew can be trusted. If this is going to work, I'm going to need a hollowed out tree and leaves. Search near the loggers north of us for the tree. You'll need to find the leaves by yourself. Check the forest. "
345,Totem of Coo,Find the Totem of Coo using the clues provided to you. ,"You begin to read the totem, barely able to pronounce the awkward words and phrases. Slowly, words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go up the nearby hill, to the northeast. "
346,On the Wings of a Hippogryph,Purchase a hippogryph ride to the Exodar from Zaldaan. ,"For a small fee, you can rent one of my hippogryphs to fly you to the Exodar. Taking the hippogryph is a faster, not to mention safer, alternative for someone carrying an important message. If you'd like to take a ride, speak to me again and I'll make the arrangements. "
347,Travel to Azure Watch,Speak with Technician Dyvuun at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle. ,"By all that is good, <name>, you must go at once to this Azure Watch and speak with Dyvuun! There is a path that leads west off of this tiny isle.  Follow it and cross the Crystalbrook River to arrive on the larger part of the isle.  Continue to follow the path and you should find Azure Watch. See if you can convince them to send us some aid and supplies.  The rest of us will follow when we can. Thank you, we wouldn't have made it without you! "
348,Totem of Yor,Find the Totem of Yor using the clues provided to you. ,"The symbols on this totem seem to translate much faster. The patterns and imagery all seem to blend into familiar words. You are fairly certain the totem is pointing you south, down the river. Something is at the bottom of the river itself. "
349,The Missing Fisherman,Find Cowlen at the southeast docks of Silvermyst Isle off the coast of Azuremyst. ,"In the fevered dreams of our injured guest, she spoke of a fisherman, Cowlen, who was in some distress at Silvermyst Isle, to the southwest, off the coast of Azuremyst. With all that has been happening, no one has had the opportunity to look into it, but I do feel a bit of worry. Perhaps there's something you can do, <name>? "
350,Ending Their World,Follow and protect Demolitionist Legoso as he attempts to destroy the Vector Coil and slay Sironas. ,"Don't accept this assignment if you value your life. You see that gigantic power core jutting out of the mountain side over yonder? Whoever takes on this burden will need to fight their way through that mountain, battling an army of Sunhawks while protecting me as I rig the core up for demolition. Sironas the eredar is somewhere up there as well. I won't think less of you if you just walk away, <name>. But maybe you're the one - the one to destroy the Vector Coil and take down Sironas. Well, are you? "
351,Ysera's Tears,Maatparm at Blood Watch wants 2 Ysera's Tears. ,"Good to see you again, <name>! You were exceptionally efficient in completing the last task that I offered you. Perhaps you would be interested in another? To the northeast lies Wyrmscar Island, home to a rare species of mushroom known as Ysera's tear - named after the green dragonlings that inhabit the island. I only require a small sampling of the mushroom, but I must warn you that the denizens of the island do not welcome visitors. Tread carefully. "
352,Matis the Cruel,Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to capture Matis the Cruel. ,"Matis will be brought to justice, <name>; and I want you to be the one to find him and bring him back to the Triumvirate. Scour the island for this killer. Should you find him, use this flare gun. When my trackers see the flare, they'll come and assist in capturing Matis. Return to me after he's been captured. "
353,Declaration of Power,Kessel at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle wants you to kill Lord Xiz at Wrathscale Lair and drive the Draenei Banner through his dead body. ,"Have you seen the serpent men? The ones that call themselves naga? < Kessel spits. >They dared make an advance upon this camp under cover of darkness only three nights ago. Can you believe the audacity of those primitive beasts? I need you to deliver a message to their leadership, <name>. To the northeast is Wrathscale Lair, home to Lord Xiz. Find him, slay him where he stands and drive this banner through his corpse. Let them know fear whenever they should see our standard! "
354,The Kessel Run,"Kessel at Kessel's Crossing wants you to warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing of the imminent blood elf invasion. ","You're just in time, <name>. Blood elf activity in this area has doubled in the past week. Our agents have informed us that the blood elves that call themselves Sunhawks plan to launch an offensive upon Azuremyst soon. I need you to get a warning out to our allies and compatriots. Warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing. Time is of the essence so I am lending you my elekk. Be sure to keep it out of water. "
355,Saving Princess Stillpine,Release Princess Stillpine from her cage and then speak with Stillpine Ambassador Frasaboo at Blood Watch. ,"Help me, <name>! The Bristlelimb captured me and are planning to sacrifice me to their foul gods! High Chief Bristlelimb holds the key that opens the cage. To force him to appear, you must slaughter the evil Bristlelimb furbolgs that inhabit the enclave, just two camps to the west of this camp. If you kill enough of them, he will surely come for vengeance! When he shows up, kill him and get the key! My father will richly reward you if you can save me! "
356,I Shoot Magic Into the Darkness,Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to locate the Sun Portal Site and slay 5 Void Anomalies. ,"Velen states that if the blood elves have been opening rifts between this island and the Outland, there will be residue or anomalies left in the areas where the portals have been opened. You must search the island for locations that exhibit or display these anomalies. Be warned, <name>; some of these anomalies will be creatures from the void itself. Should you find void anomalies, slay them! Report back to me with any new information that you may find. Begin your search to the north, near the Warp Piston. "
357,The Unwritten Prophecy,These islands will serve as the home to thousands. ,"These islands will serve as the home to thousands. Most of these people will remain here their entire lives. If you so desired, you could do the same. But that's not what you want, is it, <name>? You will do many more great things before you pass. You must embrace your destiny and meet it head on! Before you leave, I present you with two gifts: This tabard is worn by only the most revered of the Hand of Argus and this signet ring worn by our wisest sages. Wear them both with pride, <name>. "
358,Signs of the Legion,"Kill 8 Nazzivus Satyr and 8 Nazzivus Felsworn, then bring Tzerak's Armor Plate to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch. ","The armor scrap is forged from a deep black metal that seems to absorb light. Although it doesn't appear to be enchanted, there is an unmistakable sense of wrongness about it. Such armor is only used by one force - the Burning Legion. The Legion's presence here can only mean that they're intending to mobilize the island's satyr against the draenei. Take action against the local satyr, then return to Blood Watch and show this armor scrap to Vindicator Aalesia. "
359,Pilfered Equipment,"Bring Clopper's Equipment back to Clopper Wizbang, who is hiding in a beached turtle shell. ","Shh! Keep your voice down and don't call attention to me. If the murlocs detect my presence, the experiment will be ruined! I've already come perilously close to contaminating my data. While I was foraging yesterday, one of them must've wandered too close and discovered my camp. I returned just in time to see two of them carrying off a crate with most of my equipment! It's bound to be in one of their settlements around here, but I can't risk revealing my presence. Are you willing to help? "
360,Blood Watch,Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Spies. ,"Blood Watch is one of two forward bases operated by the Hand of Argus. You have already been to the other base, Azure Watch; things are completely different in Bloodmyst. When we first got here, the land was as beautiful as Azuremyst. We even called it Silvergale but now sickness is spreading across the land, worse yet, the blood elves that we were battling on the Exodar survived the crash. This brings me to your assignment: Venture northwest into Bladewood and terminate any blood elves that you find. "
361,The Sun Gate,Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to destroy the Sun Gate. ,"Thanks to you and the work you did, my scouts were able to find the sun gate. The elves keep the portal location mobile so that they can move it at a moment's notice. That's why the site you investigated was empty. The strength of such a system is also its greatest weakness. The sun gate is stabilized by portal controllers. If we can take down the controllers, the portal will be ours to destroy. The current sun gate location can be found west of here, south of the Vector Coil. Find it and destroy it! "
362,Into the Dream,Prince Toreth at Wyrmscar Island has asked that you slay 5 Veridian Whelps and 5 Veridian Broodlings. ,"The whelps that you see on this island are the agitated spirits of the green dragonflight. Like me, they are bound to the land, unable to ascend to their final resting place in the Dream. Recovering the bones of the fallen has settled them somewhat but you must take further action. Destroy their ethereal manifestations. I cannot leave this place until it is done. They must be released! "
363,Razormaw,Prince Toreth at Wyrmscar Island has asked that you slay Razormaw. ,"Many of the black dragonflight were slain during the attacks. One of them, a lieutenant of Deathwing himself, still haunts this place. If you look to the heavens, you can see his spectral countenance circling the skies. His hatred is so great that he remains even in death. Take the bones that you gathered for me earlier to the top of the mountain on this island and place them in the ever-burning pyre. This act should signal Razormaw to descend. When he does, slay his undead form. "
364,Victims of Corruption,Bring 6 pieces of Crystallized Bark to Morae in Blood Watch. ,"Bloodmyst Isle was forever changed by our arrival. The Exodar's crash scattered debris all over the islands and I think it's beginning to have an adverse effect on the wildlife. Before I can be certain of my conclusion, I'll need to get a closer look. The crystals seem to have affected the trees the fastest, so it seems that the treants would be the most likely to show symptoms. If you bring me samples of bark from corrupted treants, I can begin my in-depth studies. "
365,Catch and Release,Morae at Blood Watch wants you to 'mark' 6 Blacksilt Scouts using the Murloc Tagger. ,"The Blacksilt murlocs on the southwestern coast are curious creatures. In some ways, they act barely sentient, yet in others, they show a remarkable degree of organization. I have a few theories about that, but no real way to test them until recently. I've devised a method that will allow me to track the murlocs I'm interested in without doing any lasting harm or interfering with their natural behavior. If you're willing to help with the marking, I'll gladly pay you for your assistance. "
366,Galaen's Journal - The Fate of Vindicator Saruan,Take Galaen's Journal to Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch. ,Your hands tremble as you pick up the book. Kuros must be told about this tragedy. Return the book to him. 
367,What Argus Means to Me,Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch has told you to speak with Vindicator Boros. ,"What does Argus mean to you, <name>? Many draenei probably do not know or remember our home planet. It is there that we split from the man'ari: the twisted demonic reflections of ourselves that were 'gifted' by Sargeras. Or as they call themselves, eredar. Eredar. . . this word once held meaning. <Admetius smacks his lips as if to taste the word. >Disgusting. Let us not waste anymore time. Find Vindicator Boros to begin your training. "
368,Galaen's Fate,Bring Galaen's Amulet to Morae at Blood Watch. ,"You have no means of identifying the corpse as Galaen with the information Morae gave you, but the clothing appears to have been torn in search of valuables. The blood elves in the area would've claimed anything of value from the wreckage, including Galaen's jeweled amulet. Although her husband did not survive the crash, you believe that Morae would be grateful if you recovered her husband's amulet from the blood elves. "
369,Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie,"Maatparm at Blood Watch wants 1 Aquatic Stinkhorn, 1 Blood Mushroom, 1 Ruinous Polyspore, and 1 Fel Cone Fungus. ","Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers! What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me. "
370,What We Know. . . ,Speak to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch. ,"We've learned much of our enemies in recent days. The blood elves are led by a being known as Sironas and plot to destroy us. Ultimately, they seek to enslave O'ros and regain control of the Exodar. Light be praised, we have stopped their supply line by destroying the sun gate. Unfortunately, they continue to use the contaminant of the Vector Coil to poison the land, using the mutagenic properties of the fallout to their advantage. With this knowledge, Admetius has devised a plan. Seek him out. "
371,Urgent Delivery,Are you &lt; name&gt; ? It's about time! I'd just about given up on finding you! There's an urgent message waiting for you at the mailbox. ,Are you <name>? It's about time! I'd just about given up on finding you! There's an urgent message waiting for you at the mailbox. The person that gave it to me was a human admiral from Azuremyst. Admiral Odesy-something. . . the name escapes me. He said you would know who he was. 
372,Salvaging the Data,Obtain the Survey Data Crystal from the Wrathscale near the dead cartographers and return it to Harbinger Mikolaas at Blood Watch. ,"It's too late to assist the cartographers in completing their mission, but it appears they collected the data Harbinger Mikolaas was expecting. The crystal storing their survey information was not among their ransacked packs, so it must be in the hands of the Wrathscale naga. You know that Harbinger Mikolaas will be saddened by the loss of the survey crew, but would want to salvage the survey data. "
373,Intercepting the Message,"Kill Sunhawk elves until you find the Sunhawk Missive, then return it to Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch. ","It is good to see you again, <name>. I have a quandary that you might be able to solve. Our agents situated behind Sunhawk lines have reported seeing Sunhawk soldiers parsing an unusual document. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in acquiring a copy of the document for ourselves. I need you to go out in the field and try to recover the document. I am certain that if you apply enough pressure, a Sunhawk agent will turn over the information we seek. I leave the use of force to your discretion. "
374,The Cryo-Core,Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to recover 12 boxes of Medical Supplies. ,"We have others pursuing leads on the sun portals, <name>. I need you to focus on the task at hand. Boros has received new reports of another crash site. What we've since discovered is that the crash site is actually the Exodar's cryo-core. This is a pod holding area that houses pods exactly like the ones we draenei crawled out of in Ammen Vale. This area also holds medical supplies. Head to the Cryo-Core, directly west of Blood Watch. Search for supplies and search for survivors. "
375,A Favorite Treat,Aonar at Kessel's Crossing wants you to bring him 10 Sand Pears. ,"I've made a wonderful discovery, <class>. On the uncorrupted part of the island grows a remarkable fruit called the sand pear. They're found near the bottoms of the trees. I've been preparing pies from them, but if I'm not careful, the elekk will start to wander over and steal my fruit. I've taken to gathering enough to share with the animals, but my stores are gone and the craving for pie has returned. Would you be willing to help gather the fruit I need for another batch of pies? I promise I'll share! "
376,Clearing the Way,Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest wants you to slay 8 Sunhawk Saboteurs and 8 Sunhawk Agents. ,"Only the most battle hardened, noble and positively fearless will submit to Legoso's mission. The exarch will not order any agent of the Hand to take on the task of destroying the Vector Coil and dispatching Sironas. He refuses to send any draenei to their death - which is what the mission is: suicide. . . <Corin sighs. >My job is to soften up the Sunhawk defenses. You are to slay Sunhawks near the Vector Coil and keep the path clear for our champion - whoever that may be. "
377,Audience with the Prophet,Take the Translated Sunhawk Missive to Prophet Velen at the Exodar. ,"I need you to deliver the translated documents to Velen personally, <name>. I don't trust that deranged messenger. Explain to the Prophet that the blood elves are receiving reinforcements from the Outland and that they have a spy amongst the draenei at the Exodar. Velen resides in the Vault of Lights inside the Exodar. Make haste! "
378,Artifacts of the Blacksilt,"Bring 3 Crude Murloc Idols and 6 Crude Murloc Knives to Clopper Wizbang, who is hiding in a beached turtle shell. ","My observations and writings about the Blacksilt murlocs are quite illuminating, <name>, but they are just the beginning. I plan to return to Ironforge with items produced by the Blacksilts' rudimentary crafting skills. The problem is that the Blacksilt carry these items with them at all times, and I can't have their blood on my conscience. If you're willing to help me gather the idols carried by Blacksilt seers and crude knives of the Blacksilt warriors and shorestrikers, I won't ask how you came by them. "
379,What We Don't Know. . . ,Speak to a Captured Sunhawk Agent at Blood Watch and recover Sunhawk Information. ,"Our attempts at interrogation have failed miserably, <name>. Torture is - of course - out of the question. What we need is a <race> on the inside. I can cast a spell upon you that would make you appear blood elf and adjust your language. Through subterfuge, we may be able to get the information we need out of the captured agent. Under this guise, I want you to get whatever information you can out of the prisoner. And <name>, do not leave Blood Watch while disguised as the spell will fail. "
380,The Final Sample,Get an Axxarian Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Axxarien Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,"There's just one sample remaining before I can send this set of crystals to the Exodar, <name>. The final sample must come from the satyr stronghold of Axxarien to the northwest. I'm not certain what to expect from this crystal sample, but I'm sure there will be some signs of corruption. Take care to mine your shard from the crystal that looks like the ones you took your previous samples from, or else our researchers cannot make a valid comparison. "
381,Irradiated Crystal Shards,Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to bring him 10 Irradiated Crystal Shards. ,"The Exodar's crash scattered pieces of fouled crystals all over Bloodmyst Isle, corrupting the water and the landscape. We've even begun finding pieces of the crystals inside the flesh of animals taken for meat. I've uncovered a way to purify the shard and turn them into functional crystals, so if you bring me enough shards, I'll trade one of my completed crystals for them. So far I've found the shards in the bodies of bears, ravagers, flutterers, and treants inhabiting the corrupted part of the island. "
382,Translations. . . ,Take the Sunhawk Missive to Interrogator Elysia at Blood Watch. ,"Our chief interrogator, Elysia, is fluent in Thalassian. Take the document to her and see what she has to say. "
383,Truth or Fiction,Take Velen's Orders to Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch. ,"I thank you for the timely delivery, <name>. You are turning out to be one of the Hand's better agents. If only we knew who they reported to in Bloodmyst and more importantly, where this sun portal was. . . They seem to have it tightly guarded - wherever it may be. Would you be interested in some reconnaissance work? If so, take these orders back to Vindicator Boros. He will give you your next mission. "
384,Limits of Physical Exhaustion,Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Pyromancers and 10 Sunhawk Defenders. ,"Victory is close at hand, <name>. With the discovery of the sun gate, it won't be long until their supply lines are completely closed off. Now is the time to strike at their numbers. To the west you will find numerous Sunhawk camps. The Sunhawk pyromancers and defenders occupy the vast majority of the area. Find them, kill them and return to me. "
385,Vindicator's Rest,Speak with Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest on Bloodmyst Isle. ,"I would not ask you to single-handedly bear the burden of destroying the Vector Coil and slaying Sironas, <name>; however, I believe that you can be of some help in clearing the way for others that might take on such a dangerous assignment. Take the road going north out of Blood Watch and follow it until you get to the fork. Once there, take the left road and follow it until you see Vindicator's Rest - it will be slightly west of the road itself. Corin will be waiting for you. "
386,Elekks Are Serious Business,Speak with Vorkhan the Elekk Herder on Bloodmyst Isle. ,"Is he crazy? Entrusting something like this to some no-named <race> youngling! Just remember this kid: You'll never make it as a Hand of Argus! You don't have the guts! I guess I'll have to humor him this time. Speak with Vorkhan at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle. Just follow the road north from here, and when it forks, just keep on going north. "
387,Critters of the Void,Kill 12 Void Critters and report to Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch. ,"Aesom sent my squad out on a reconnaissance mission to search for the sun gate a few days ago. Needless to say, we found it. . . <Loryi points at Jorli. >Whatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released. The area is teaming with void critters. We must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies. You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate. Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done. "
388,Don't Drink the Water,Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to use the Water Sample Flask to get a Bloodmyst Water Sample. ,Our shaman claim that the elements of water have become greatly agitated by the pollution of the water source. We know that the Exodar's power core is lodged into the mountain to the west. It must be leaking volatile fluids into the water supply! I need you to get me more information. <Aesom points to a flask and nods. >You are to take this flask and follow the beach north until you reach the area where the rivers of Bloodmyst drain into the ocean. Take a sample from that location and return to me. 
389,WANTED: Deathclaw,Bring Deathclaw's Paw to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,By order of Harbinger Mikolaas: A bounty to be paid to the brave soul who returns with proof of the marauding bear Deathclaw's demise. Deathclaw should be considered extremely dangerous and is responsible for the killing of a survey team on the coast to the northwest of Blood Watch. Travelers are advised to avoid the area. 
390,Restoring Sanctity,Prince Toreth on Wyrmscar Island wants you to recover 8 Dragon Bones. ,"Not long ago, the once tranquil owlkin of the region appeared on the shores of this island. One by one they would come to steal the bones of the fallen dragons. I do not know what would cause these creatures such distress or why they would want the bones of the deceased, but the spirits of the brood have grown restless due to this sacrilege. To the west, across the Crimson Reach, you will find Ragefeather Ridge. Venture to the owlkin encampments and recover the pilfered dragon bones. "
391,Hero's Call: Bloodmyst Isle! ,Report to Vorkhan the Elekk Herder at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Vorkhan the Elekk Herder at Kessel's Crossing. The people of Bloodmyst need your help to deal with treacherous blood elves and dangerous creatures loose on the island. You can reach Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle by taking the bridge north from Azuremyst Isle. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
392,The Bloodcursed Naga,Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to kill 10 Bloodcursed Naga. ,"They say when the world was sundered, this land cried the loudest. It was here that thousands of night elves faded into oblivion and in their place rose terrible creatures of hate - the naga. Obedient to their twisted queen, Azshara, they would destroy all that would dare pass through their sea. It would remain this way for thousands of years - until now. The first order of business is to remove the bloodcursed naga from the reef. "
393,Cutting a Path,Kill 10 Enraged Ravagers and return to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest. ,"During our mission to reconnoiter the Sunhawks and their portal, I sustained a serious wound. Scout Loryi has managed to staunch the bleeding and she's trying to figure out a way to evacuate me to Blood Watch. The problem is that we'd have to abandon our position here in order to guarantee a safe return. As soon as we leave this consecrated ground, we'll be set upon by ravagers. If you can clear some of the enraged ravagers, it might allow us to make the trip back safely. "
394,Know Thine Enemy,Find the Nazzivus Monument in Nazzivian and retrieve a Nazzivus Monument Glyph. ,"It's good to see another new face here in Blood Watch, <class>. Although the blood elves are the most immediate threat, there are other sinister creatures that call Bloodmyst Isle home. The Nazzivus satyr are of particular concern. They are foul, demonic creatures, commanding dark magics and feeding on the corruption created by the Exodar's crash. We must hold them in check, but first we must learn more about them. Go southwest to Nazzivian and learn what you can from their grotesque monument. "
395,"Explorers' League, Is That Something for Gnomes? ",Find Clopper Wizbang camped in an old turtle shell on the shore north of Blood Watch. ,"Babysitting! Would you believe it? They pulled me out of a promising dig and sent me along with Captain Odesyus' expedition to babysit that little gnome! I'd never heard o' a gnome wanting to become a prospector before, so I asked. Seems we are takin' gnomes now, and this particular one has a fascination with murlocs! Well, he's gone off and set up shop in an old turtle shell on the northern shore of the island. Go and have a look if you don't believe me! "
396,Fouled Water Spirits,Kill 6 Fouled Water Spirits and return to Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest. ,"Most of the creatures touched by the crystals' energy have been corrupted in the same ways: strange marks on their flesh, increased aggression, and small crystal shards in their bodies. However, the fouled water spirits north of here appear to be turning entirely to crystal. I've never seen anything react to the crystals this way before, when we explored the foul pool, they were particularly dangerous. We must get rid of them before the Sunhawks can exploit them as a new source of energy. "
397,Cruelfin's Necklace,Bring the Red Crystal Pendant to Morae at Blood Watch. ,"Examining the crudely constructed pendant, you notice the crystal pulsating softly. Though it emits little light, you can almost feel the crystal radiating a sense of wrongness. You're not quite sure what might have possessed Cruelfin to create this pendant, but the find is too important to ignore. You should probably show it to someone at Blood Watch. "
398,Culling the Flutterers,Tracker Lyceon at Blood Watch wants you to kill 10 Royal Blue Flutterers. ,"When we first encountered flutterers, they showed few signs of mutation. As the corruption got progressively worse, the moths and other species began to show signs of contamination. It has progressed to the point where they damage nearly everything they come in contact with. They're amplifying the damage being done by the crystal shards scattered by the Exodar's crash. We have no choice but to begin culling their population in the lands north of Blood Watch. "
399,"Oh, the Tangled Webs They Weave",Kill 8 Mutated Tanglers and report to Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest. ,"We don't dare abandon our post, or wander too far from Vindicator's Rest, <race>. The mutated creatures closest to the Vector Coil have been changed profoundly by energy leaking from the crystals. The mutated tanglers appear to have gained a certain degree of sentience. They've learned to create, set, and conceal vicious traps that can ensnare even the most careful warrior. We'll never be able to move against the Sunhawks if we're constantly forced to look underfoot. Attack the problem at its source, <name>. "
400,Nolkai's Words,Find the location described in Nolkai's journal and discover his long-buried possessions. ,"The translation is ready now, <name>. < Anchorite Paetheus points out a block of text at the end of his translation. >'The enemy is nearly upon us. We've gathered up all the survivors and retreated to the temple to the east. It's the last ground we truly hold on the island, and there is a sense among the survivors that we will make our last stand here. I've taken care to bury my last few possessions on the grounds of the temple, with the hope that someone will find them and know what happened here. '"
401,A Map to Where? ,Locate the pavilion described by the map and search for what the map's maker was trying to record. ,"The crudely-drawn map reveals nothing of its maker, but it appears to have been drawn with an unsteady hand. Wavering lines and symbols depict a small pavilion with broken columns located to the west of a partially submerged tower. If the map is to be believed, this cluster of ruins appears to be located on the eastern coast of the island. You have no idea what you'll find, but it was important enough for the map's creator to record. "
402,Talk to the Hand,Report to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest. ,"The Hand of Argus has established a forward base at Vindicator's Rest, but they are sorely outnumbered by both the blood elves and mutated wildlife. Without backup, their outpost is in danger of falling, and we'd have no way to keep an eye on events near the Vector Coil. Report to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest to the northwest and offer her your assistance, <name>. "
403,Coming of Age,"Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch has asked that you deliver the Exarch's Orders to Torallius the Pack Handler, standing outside of the Exodar. ","You have survived the wilds of our new home and shown yourself a cut above the others. I believe that you have come of age to assist those battling on the front lines of Bloodmyst. The Hand of Argus could use a <race> like you. Report to Torallius the Pack Handler. You will find him outside the Exodar, tending to the elekk. Give him these orders so that he may direct you towards your new duties on Bloodmyst. "
404,Alien Predators,Kill 10 Bloodmyst Hatchlings then return to Vorkhan the Elekk Herder at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle. ,"One thing we've learned in our travels is that extreme care must be taken when introducing wildlife from one world to another. When the Exodar crashed, it was carrying specimens of various Outland species, including an insectoid predator called the ravager. Some of the specimens were lost, but many others survived and took to the wild. If we don't keep them in check, they will upset the natural balance here on the islands. You'll find these ravagers to the west of Kessel's Crossing, near the coast. "
405,Containing the Threat,"Kill 5 Axxarien Shadowstalkers, 5 Axxarien Hellcallers, and Zevrax, then gather 5 Corrupted Crystals and return to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch. ","Now that we have made our presence known to the satyr, we must send a message that we will not tolerate the Burning Legion's hounds in these lands. Too long have the draenei fled in the wake of the Legion and its minions, <name>. Wherever they have found us, they have shown no mercy. We must not permit the satyr to exploit the Exodar's crash and use the corrupted crystals as weapons. Go north to where their leader resides in Axxarien, destroy him, and recover the corrupted crystals he has been gathering! "
406,Newfound Allies,Take the Letter of Introduction to Huntress Kella Nightbow in Azuremyst Isle. ,"Harbinger Mikolaas has done a commendable job of safeguarding Blood Watch, <class>, but our enemies are many and our resources few. Our weakness is well known to our enemies, but your contact with the forces of the Alliance is something they haven't accounted for. I have prepared a letter of introduction to the people of Auberdine, the closest Alliance settlement, proposing cooperation in the fight against our foes. Take it with you and seek out Huntress Kella Nightbow near the docks west of the Exodar. "
407,The Missing Expedition,"Kill 8 Myst Spinners, 8 Myst Leechers and their leader, Zarakh. ","About a week ago, my research team and I were out exploring the western wilds of Bloodmyst when we were attacked by bloodthirsty spiders. The effect of the crystal contamination was clearly evident as these spiders were massive and extremely aggressive. I managed to escape but my team wasn't so lucky. We must not let the same fate befall others. Go west to the Amberweb Pass and destroy the spiders and their matriarch, Zarakh. "
408,The Bear Necessities,Bring 8 Elder Brown Bear Flanks to Tracker Lyceon in Blood Watch. ,"As I'm sure you've seen in your time on Bloodmyst Isle, very little remains unchanged by our arrival. My training and experience has taught me that even the products of an environment like this one can be put to use. With so few resources, we must rely on our ingenuity to provide for us. I've been supplementing our stores with meat from the bears that wander this island. With the proper preparation, it can safely be eaten. If you're going to be out in the field, why not help replenish our stocks? "
409,Searching for Galaen,Search for Morae's husband Galaen. ,"Do you think often of your family, <name>? There were a number of families aboard the Exodar, but I've heard of very few being reunited. I, myself, am looking for traces of my husband Galaen, who was a technician in the Cryo-Core. The wreckage of it is located to the west, and it's swarming with blood elves! I must find out what became of Galaen! Even news of his death is better than never knowing. My husband will be wearing a pendant identical to my own; they were a gift from my sister. "
410,More Irradiated Crystal Shards,"If you have more of the irradiated crystal shards, I'd be happy to exchange them for another of my crystals. ","Very well, here are the crystals that I have, <name>. Use them well. "
411,Learning from the Crystals,Get an Impact Site Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Impact Site Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,"Welcome to Blood Watch, <class>. Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the Exodar. The problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island. The first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge. "
412,Report to Exarch Admetius,Speak with Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch. ,"A Hand of Argus soldier is many things: Obedient, brave, intelligent, and above all, honorable. You may yet exhibit some of these traits, <class>. Report to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch if you are still interested in joining the Hand. He and his subordinates will further train you in the ways of the draenei soldier. And remember this, <name>: Honorable people do not always perform honorably. Sometimes they cannot. You will find Blood Watch just up this road, to the north. "
413,They're Alive! Maybe. . . ,Researcher Cornelius has asked that you free 5 Expedition Researchers. ,"It was a bloody mess, <name>. We were ambushed by a large pack of these spiders. Their progenitor descended upon us with incredible speed and wrapped us up in cocoons. After we were webbed, she began to lay eggs near us. We were to be food for her young! FOOD! I managed to cut my way out and escape but I will not leave the others behind. So far I've been unsuccessful in nearing the pass. Would you lend a hand? Destroy those cocoons! Hopefully some of our team is still alive! "
414,Constrictor Vines,Tracker Lyceon at Blood Watch wants you to bring him 6 Thorny Constrictor Vines. ,"A good woodsman makes use of every available resource, <class>. Even the most bizarre creatures possess attributes we can use to our advantage. With Blood Watch under constant assault from the Sunhawks, we're looking to a variety of natural defenses including traps. The lasher's thorny vines are perfectly suited to the construction of the traps I have in mind. The combination of sharp spines and deadly toxin will fell unwary attackers. Bring me the vines of mutated constrictors so that I can begin my work. "
415,The Second Sample,Get an Altered Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Altered Bloodmyst Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch. ,"Now that we have the baseline crystal, we're going to need samples from more dangerous areas of the island to complete the set I'll be sending to the Exodar. The next sample must come from the crystals controlled by the blood elves in the Bladewood area to the northwest of Blood Watch. I have heard reports that they alter and harvest the crystals for use in some magical apparatus. See if you can find one that has not yet been incorporated into one of their devices, and mine a sample from it. "
416,Deciphering the Book,Take the Ancient Journal to Anchorite Paetheus in Blood Watch. ,"Lacking the means to read the book's contents, you think about who might be able to help you separate the author's words from the mapmaker's scrawl. Remembering Anchorite Paetheus 's collection of artifacts from countless cultures, you wonder if his experienced eye might be able to help you decipher the book's contents. "
417,The Missing Survey Team,Harbinger Mikolaas wants you to find the Survey Team he sent to the Ruins of Loreth'Aran and assist them in any way you can. ,"As we've gotten ourselves established here at Blood Watch, I've been sending out survey teams to create more reliable maps of the island. In most cases, they returned unharmed with the data we need, but the team I sent east to the ruins hasn't reported back. I worry about what might have happened to them, but I can't spare the men to send another mission after them. Find them, <name>, and lend them any assistance they require to return with their survey data. "
418,The First Step,Follow the path East out of Camp Narache and find Grull Hawkwind. ,"What you see here is the work of the quilboar, young one. Year after year they have encroached on our village. The great cataclysm finally drove them from their dens to spread like locusts across the land, and now you see the result; my own mother, dead from their savagery. Today, you are of age. Today, you will take up your weapon and fight for the tribe, and avenge the Greatmother. Follow the path to the east, and find my son, Grull. He will lead you in our strike against the quilboar. "
419,Rites of the Earthmother,Speak to Dyami Windsoar atop Fargaze Mesa. ,"Today, you have undertaken a rite of passage far more difficult than we ask of most of our youths. Be proud. Now, it is time for you to continue on your journey. To the west, beyond our burial ground, you will find a path winding up the mesa. Follow it to the top, and speak with Dyami Windsoar. Walk with the Earth Mother, friend. You will always be welcome here. "
420,The Battleboars,Kill 10 Armored Battleboars. ,"There are more threats to be dealt with here.  The Bristleback are taming wild boars to be used against us. These armored battleboars have been abused beyond hope of recovery; they must be put down, for our safety and their peace.  Go to the pens to the south and slay them, <name>. Return to me afterwards. "
421,Rite of Strength,Kill 6 Bristleback Invaders. ,"Behold, <name>. The very presence of the Bristleback is a blight. Nothing is left in their wake but corpses and barren land. Camp Narache could become what we see here in but a few days, unless we stand and fight. This will be your Rite of Strength; the first ceremony of a tauren brave. Go into the heart of the thornsnarl and kill Bristleback quilboar, then return to me. "
422,Feed of Evil,Use Adana's Torch to set fire to all 3 Troughs in the Battleboar Pens. ,"We must do more than simply hunt boars here. The eyesore that has been left upon the land must be purged. To give them a wild thirst for blood, the battleboars are force-fed raw flesh. Take this torch, and use it to burn the troughs of meat and gore to cinders. "
423,Rite of the Winds,Drink the Water of Vision. ,"Look, <name>. The rolling plains of Mulgore stretch before you: our home, the cradle of the Earth Mother. Here she provides us with all we could ever need, a peaceful and verdant land. This is what you will fight to protect. Your journey will take you far beyond her sheltering arms, to the farthest and cruelest regions of this world, and beyond. Below us is Bloodhoof Village. The first step on your true path begins now. Drink deep of the Water of Vision, and let the spirits guide you onward. "
424,Stop the Thorncallers,Kill 7 Bristleback Thorncallers. ,"Knowing the ways of your prey is another aspect of the hunt. In the lands they come from, quilboar live in the shade and protection of huge thorned roots. When they move, their shamans seed and grow new roots for them to live in. These thorns mar the land and choke out other life, turning the earth around them barren.  Go to the south and stop these thorncallers before they have a chance to continue, <name>. "
425,Rite of Honor,Kill Chief Squealer Thornmantle. ,"Chief Squealer Thornmantle leads these quilboar. It was he that set upon Greatmother Hawkwind and took her life, leading the attack on Camp Narache. He fled and hid afterwards, but we've found him. He lurks to the west within his foul den of thorns, fending off any braves we send in after him. You've proven yourself as a brave defender of our people, <name>. Kill Thornmantle and bring his mane back to Chief Hawkwind, in honor of our Greatmother! "
426,"Our Tribe, Imprisoned",Open 4 Quilboar Cages. ,"Despite their size, the Bristleback greatly outnumber us. A pack ambush can easily overwhelm even the largest tauren. Many new initiates have taken up arms to defend our home. Some have given their lives, but others have been captured alive. Please, find their cages and free them. The battle should keep the quilboar distracted. "
427,Go to Adana,Go to Adana Thunderhorn to the Southwest. ,"We've struck a great blow against the quilboar here. I will stay here, and hold the line, but you need to move on. Seek Adana Thunderhorn; she has taken a few braves to the southwest to root out the rest of the Bristleback. "
428,Rite of Courage,Recover 7 Stolen Rifles from Bristleback Gun Thieves. ,"One of the first lessons you should learn, <name>, is to never underestimate your prey. While we were distracted by the attack on Camp Narache, more of the Bristleback swept in unnoticed and stole a cache of our rifles. You can see them to the south now, filling the air with lead. This is your Rite of Courage: brave the hail of gunfire, hunt the Bristleback gun thieves, and bring back our rifles. "
429,"Last Rites, First Rites",Use the Ceremonial Offering at Greatmother Hawkwind's grave. ,"The camp is safe, and the quilboar driven off, all thanks to you, young one. You have my personal thanks for what you have done for my mother, my son, and for all of us. It is now time to put Greatmother Hawkwind to rest. Lay the final offering at her feet, <name>, and we will say our goodbyes. "
430,The Absent-Minded Prospector,Escort the confused Prospector Remtravel to his missing journal. ,"Who are you again? <name>? Have we met? If you're here from the League, you can tell them I'm not leaving! Not without my find. I had it, right in my hands! Then the screaming. Then the wetness. Listen here whos-yer-name, I documented the whole thing in my journal the day the tidal wave hit. And I know just where I left it! The journal. Not the find. Help me get the one so we can get the other! Or vice-versa! Do you follow? Follow me! "
431,A Taste for Grouper,Use your fishing skill to obtain 4 Darkshore Grouper. ,"Between boat rides and building, I'm exhausted. . . and hungry. You know what sounds tasty? Fish. Fish sound delicious. Darkshore is known for its grouper. If you fish me up some, I'll make it worth your time. "
432,One Shot. One Kill. ,"Protect Sentinel Aynasha, then speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale. ","I was traveling to Lor'danel with an important message when I was attacked by the furbolg Marosh and his trackers. During the attack I was poisoned, leaving me barely able to stand. I can make an antidote, but it will take time before it is ready. I would ask that you defend me until I can apply the antidote. I will aid you with my bow as best I can. Should we survive, I will be able to deliver my message to Lor'danel, while you speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post to inform her of this incident. "
433,Remembrance of Auberdine,I just want to offer my sincerest thanks for all that you've done for us. ,"I just want to offer my sincerest thanks for all that you've done for us. In my grief, I'm afraid that I didn't extend the gratitude that you truly deserve. We may not have made it here without you. Know that you will always have friends here. And you needn't worry about my loneliness. Grimclaw has taken to keeping me company, and I have to say he's a more comforting companion than I would have expected. Take this, and go with all our blessings. Until we meet again, <name>. "
434,The Looting of Althalaxx,Locate Narassin's Tome among the ruins of Althalaxx and kill the Forsaken commander Teegan Holloway. ,"Before you rejoin the battle, <class>, something urgent has come to my attention. My scouts report that the Forsaken are scouring the ruined tower of Althalaxx to our south. Prior to the assault, that bleak tower housed a fanatical arm of the Shadow Council commanded by the fallen highborne Athrikus Narassin. Narassin is long since dead, but if any of his work survives, we can't allow it out of our sight. Retrieve his research and kill the Forsaken commander who's plundering the ruins. "
435,The Last Wave of Survivors,Locate any refugees from Auberdine that are still alive. ,"It's too late for Laird, he didn't make it in time. The last wave of night elves from Auberdine attempted to escape a couple of hours ago. They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not. Quickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending Sentinels and Hippogryphs down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it. "
436,The Battle for Darkshore,Slay the Avatar of Soggoth at the Master's Glaive. ,"The ancients of the grove have come to our aid, <name>.  I can see through their eyes even as we speak. The Twilight's Hammer has been forced to hasten their ritual and have thus only managed to resurrect but a remnant of dread Soggoth. Destroy it before it's too late, <name>.  I am needed elsewhere. Return to the druids at the Grove of the Ancients when it is all over they will direct you further. "
437,The Shatterspear Invaders,Report to Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze at the Ruins of Mathystra. ,"If we didn't have enough on our hands with the land and the elements turning against us, it seems something has riled up the trolls to the northeast, and they've started on a war path. I'm not sure what their aims are, but they've already attacked several of our scouts and have besieged the cultists at the Tower of Althalaxx. We've sent a contingent of our best Sentinels to counter their attacks. If you would travel northeast to the ruins and join them, I'm certain that they could use the extra hand. "
438,The Bear's Blessing,Elder Brolg at Blackwood Hold wants you to bring him the Blessed Herb Bundle. ,"Before the bear's paw can be used to cleanse the afflicted, it must be completed and blessed. To the north of the village roams a tallstrider named Fleetfoot. You'll need its tailfeathers to complete the herb bundle. Bring the tailfeathers and the bear's paw bundle to the ancient bear statue in the ruins around the Grove of the Ancient, further north of where you'll find Fleetfoot. While at the shrine, combine the tailfeathers with the bear's paw and receive the bear spirit's blessing. "
439,The Twilight's Hammer,Slay High Cultist Azerynn and 10 Twilight Fanatics in the Twilight Encampment. ,"A group of Twilight's Hammer cultists has set up camp southwest of here.  They're preparing an army of water elementals to use against Lor'danel. Their leader, High Cultist Azerynn, has pacts with the dark Old Gods that grant his sect power over the elements.  Go and deal with them before it's too late, <name>. The cataclysm has left the elemental spirits in disarray. . . it's only a matter of time until they have enough elementals to overcome our defenses. "
440,The Seeds of Life,"Gather a Seed of the Earth, a Seed of the Sea, and a Seed of the Sky. ","Something is trying to devour the life of Darkshore from within! I'll ask around to learn more about the - thing - you discovered in the lake. Meanwhile, we need to protect the local wildlife from further harm. Can you gather some materials for me? I'll need life in all its incarnations. Talk to Onu here in the grove to acquire a Seed of the Earth. Capture a Darkshore Wisp floating amongst the trees and we'll have a Seed of the Sky. Find a Seed of the Sea within seashells along the coast, west of here. "
441,The Final Flame of Bashal'Aran,Extinguish the Final Flame of Bashal'Aran. ,"It is in times like these that we are forced to stop and examine our way of life. We are mortal now, and no matter how much we desire otherwise, we are deserving of our new place in this world. Bashal'Aran, down the road to the south, once a city of our ancestors, it now is home to their cursed ghosts. We held hope of salvation for them as with ourselves, but we have left them in torment for too long. It is time to extinguish the Final Flame of Bashal'Aran. "
442,Ritual Materials,"Retrieve 3 Moonstalker Whiskers, 3 Tufts of Mottled Doe Hair, and 3 Thistle Bear Fur. ","While we tend to Grimclaw, I would like you to peacefully gather some ritual materials for me from the nearby wildlife. I need whiskers from the moonstalkers to the west- pluck them from the sleeping ones and move away quickly. I need hair from the doe to the east, just avoid the stags. Finally, I need fur from the bears along the water to the northeast. Wait until they catch a fish, then get the sample quickly and get away before they finish eating. Please do not harm any of them. "
443,Naga In Our Midst,Return to Balren of the Claw at the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore. ,"The creature appears to have had its skull broken in a fight with Aros.  It looks like what you've heard described as a naga before. It is said that despite their monstrous features, naga are night elves warped by the arcane magic of Queen Azshara. It seems they've decided to stop you from obtaining the horn of the ancients. "
444,Threat from the Water,Kill 8 Vile Spray. ,"Some of the survivors of this last Auberdine attack are still trying to make it up the coast to safety. We only caught word that they were coming within the last hour. I wish that we had more warning. . . The coastline west of us is swarming with vile spray, vicious little water elementals. We need to clear them out if any of the survivors are to have a chance of making it to Lor'danel. Depart immediately and kill every elemental you see. "
445,Leave No Tracks,Sneak into the Master's Glaive using the Panther Figurine and spy on the Twilight's Hammer. ,"To the southwest lies the corpse of a being somehow related to the Old Gods that the Twilight's Hammer cultists worship. He was defeated before our time -- if not by the Titans themselves, certainly by one of their creations. We've noted an increase in cult activity in that area which can only mean something terrible is amiss. We're going to need to find out what they're planning to do there and why.  Take this figurine, it'll help you avoid being detected while you gather intelligence. "
446,Timely Arrival,Escort Sentinel Aynasha to safety. ,"It's good to see you. I wasn't looking forward to enduring what Alanndarian did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome. I saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield. Morra needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here. Help me to the dock - I'll make my way to Lor'danel via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel. "
447,Breaking Waves of Change,"Use the teleportation tree in western Darnassus to reach Rut'theran Village, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a ride to Lor'danel. ","You! You look able. And perhaps willing to help? Auberdine has finally fallen. Though many of its inhabitants departed long ago when the city first suffered the brunt of the Cataclysm, many of the more stubborn residents are yet unaccounted for. And it now appears that the city may have been overrun by water elementals. My sisters need help rescuing the survivors. Please, <class>, use the western tree to reach Rut'theran, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a flight to Lor'danel. Be swift! "
448,Buzzbox 413,Gather 4 Corrupted Tide Crawler Flesh samples and bring them to Buzzbox 413 for analysis. ,"Greetings! I'm helping Tharnariun here try to unravel what's been corrupting the wildlife in the area. I've set up some machines in the field that can analyze animal parts and possible corruption agents. If you can get me some good samples, we can get to the bottom of this affliction quickly. The first machine is Buzzbox 413. I set it up on the beach just east of town. I'll need you to gather some flesh from the nearby corrupted tide crawlers and bring it to the machine so that I can analyze it. "
449,Disturbing Connections,Bring the Hellscream's Missive to Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea at Lor'danel. ,"The letter from Garrosh Hellscream makes clear the suspicions that were raised during the offensive on the Shatterspear. The presence of forsaken at the tower ruins and horde supplies and enforcers at the Shatterspear War Camp were only the start. Garrosh himself contacted the Shatterspear to spur their offensive towards Lor'danel, and it seems clear that he fully intends to push from the south as well. Glynda Nal'Shea will need this information if the night elves are to be prepared. "
450,The Titans' Terminal,Use Buried Artifact Detector on the beach near Remtravel's Excavation site to locate 5 Ancient Device Fragments. ,"Now that we have the disc, a lot of our earlier finds are starting to make sense. Shortly after my arrival, Prospector Remtravel unearthed what he presumed to be a prehistoric toaster. It's my belief that this slotted box is some sort of data reader. Unfortunately, it broke apart and washed away with the rest of our base camp when the tidal wave struck! It can't have gone far, <name>. Pieces must be buried in the nearby sand. Here, use my trusty buried artifact detector to comb the beach for them. "
451,The Ancients' Ire,Utilize a Vengeful Protector to kill 30 Shatterspear trolls and destroy 6 Shatterspear Structures. ,"Come to join the offensive? If you're looking for Sandrya Moonfall, she's leading the attack on the Shatterspear leader at the cave in the back of the vale, you can meet her there. While you're here though, we could certainly use your help with routing the rest of their tribe. Go ahead and take the company of one of the Vengeful Protectors there and see to it that every last building is destroyed and every last troll killed. We can't have them coming back for revenge when we're less prepared, can we? "
452,War Supplies,Destroy 12 Shatterspear Armaments. ,"The trolls are building their forces and supplies at the war camp to the north. When they feel they are ready, they will almost certainly launch their attack on Lor'danel from that location. It shouldn't take us long to rout this rabble, but I'm not one for taking unnecessary risks. I want you to fight your way into the war camp and set fire to any stockpiles of supplies that you see. The setback should buy us quite a bit of time before they can muster a counterattack. "
453,Denying Manpower,Kill 6 Horde Enforcers and 6 Shatterspear Mystics. ,"To the north, the Shatterspear have a war camp where they are constructing their catapults. The camp is guarded by some of their mystics, but I've started receiving reports that there are sightings of orcs and tauren there as well. I don't want to make any assumptions as to what that suggests, but I do want you to go in and kill them before they can make any further strikes on our Sentinels. "
454,An Ocean Not So Deep,Gorbold Steelhand at Lor'danel wants you to speak to Gary for further instructions. ,"You look like an able sort! There are a great number of wrecks off of the coast here. . . most old, some new. For quite some time, I've been trying to get at their holds and put their valuables to more use, but there's a nasty infestation of murlocs that seem to have other ideas. I've sent scores of adventurers and none have returned. Worry not, I've learned my lesson, and that is not your fate. Swim to the due north and look for Gary. He'll explain the new plan. It's pretty simple really. "
455,Ending the Threat,"Speak to Sandrya Moonfall to start the attack, and aid her in killing Jor'kil the Soulripper. ","Their leader and his guard are before us. My Sentinels are ready to take care of his guard, we only awaited this arrow to seal their leader's fate. Let me know when you are prepared to attack. As soon as my Sentinels engage, I will shatter the leader's shield, and we will assault him together. Strike swiftly and we can rout this threat to our lands here and now. We await only you - speak to me when ready. "
456,Stepping Up Surveillance,Sneak into the Master's Glaive using the Panther Figurine and spy on the Twilight's Hammer leaders on the platform above. ,The cultists appear to be digging out the remains of a being known as Soggoth the Slitherer. Perhaps their superiors on the rafters above have more information. 
457,A Lost Companion,Locate Grimclaw. ,"Please help. . . I can barely sit up. My friend, a bear named Grimclaw, he's not here. I sent him ahead to let the Sentinels know we were coming before we left Auberdine, but he never arrived. I sensed something might be amiss as we were leaving, but with the evacuation, I never had a chance to act on it. If he's injured, there's only one place that he would go - the Withering Thicket, north of Auberdine, down the road to the south from here. Bring him back to me safely. . . he's my only family. "
458,The Eye of All Storms,Ride Thessera to defeat 12 Twilight Riders and destroy the Twilight Portal. ,Twilight riders circle the skies above the vortex.  I fear it is their magic that has kept the cataclysmic forces from being contained by our efforts. Take to the skies with Thessera and destroy the riders and the portal from whence they came. 
459,On the Brink,Retrieve 6 Shatterspear Amulets. ,"I've already been working on something for breaking down their protective wards. With a focus based in their power and a bit of druidic magic, we should be able to breach their shields. Find their shaman to the east and southeast and recover several of their amulets. I will prepare them and imbue an arrow that you can deliver to Sandrya Moonfall for the attack. "
460,The Waking Nightmare,Obtain the Emerald Scroll from the Nightmare Guardian inside the Earthshatter Cavern. ,"Malfurion's words are true, small one.  The rift that threatens to split Darkshore in half also threatens the separation between this world and yours. Let me aid you in any way that I can, lest further rifts between our worlds amplify the destruction taking place in both places. First you must undo the shackles cast upon me by retrieving the emerald scroll from the nightmare guardian that roams the halls below. "
461,Remnants of the Highborne,Retrieve 8 Highborne Relics. ,"There are several ruins similar to these spread through Darkshore, many of them inhabited by the troubled spirits of the Highborne. Out of mild courtesy for their cursed souls, we haven't been overly proactive about stripping the ruins of artifacts, but those hesitancies vanish in light of this new troll threat. While you're aiding the Sentinels in their goals within the ruins, please collect any artifacts that you stumble upon and bring them back to me. I would like to preserve what little I can. "
462,Twice Removed,"Use the Petrified Root to raise 6 Withered Ents and dispatch the naga leader, Lady Janira. ","We cannot condone reckless violence - it is not our nature. However, there are times when the consequences of avoiding battle are too tangible to ignore, as is the case with these naga. When the earth in the area shattered, a small section of ruins rose to our east. These ruins once housed those loyal to Queen Azshara, and it seems her kind have returned in search of something. Take this petrified root. You can use it on their fallen to raise ents to aid you. Deal with them and their leader swiftly. "
463,Bearer of Good Fortune,Free 8 Uncorrupted Thistle Bears or Uncorrupted Duskrats from the cages in Cliffspring Hollow. ,This key appears to be for the animal cages spread throughout Cliffspring Hollow. Tharnariun would surely appreciate if you took advantage of the situation to free some of the uncorrupted duskrats and thistle bears that are still being held captive. 
464,In Aid of the Refugees,Sentinel Lendra at Lor'danel wants you to speak to Priestess Alinya at the Refugee Camp. ,By Elune!  It appears that many of those we feared dead from the attack on old Auberdine have taken refuge in a camp outside the town ruins. The cultists at the Twilight Encampment were planning on making quick work of them.  It's a good thing that you successfully attacked their position. Seek out Priestess Alinya at the Refugee Camp east of old Auberdine and far south of here. 
465,The Bear's Paw,Bring 8 stalks of Bear's Paw to Elder Brolg at Blackwood Hold. ,"The foul satyr of Felwood have started to introduce their poison into Darkshore, into our lands. Their corruption kills the land and twists the creatures who live in it. My people are no exception. Our magic alone is not enough to bring them back to their senses. There is an herb, called bear's paw, that we use to break fevers and fortify the weak. With its help, we may be able to break the influence of the satyr. The herb grows in the wilds around the village. "
466,The Corruption's Source,Kill Zenn Foulhoof and 8 Vile Grell in Cliffspring Hollow. ,"I rushed here as soon as I heard the news from Wizbang. I know who's behind this mess now. Zenn Foulhoof. He came over from Teldrassil after he was chased out for performing perverse magics. The kinds of corruption he employs are not welcome among my people, and it seems he's taken it a step further this time, perhaps as some form of revenge. Zenn's been given too many chances, it's time we remove this threat to all that is natural. Kill Zenn and his minions, and then find me back in Lor'danel. "
467,In Defense of Darkshore,Talk to Orseus outside the Grove of the Ancients and mount a hippogryph. ,"Now that we know our preventative measures work, we should cover as much ground as possible. I've arranged to commandeer one of our hippogryphs, but I can't do this alone. Talk to my friend Orseus, next to the flight master right outside the grove here. Let him know when you're ready and I'll meet you there. We'll canvas Darkshore from the air and protect as many animals as we can! "
468,The Land Is in Their Blood,Speak to Elder Brownpaw at the Blackwood Camp southwest of the Eye of the Vortex. ,"If we're to stabilize the forces of nature, we'll need every little bit of help we can get.  The furbolg of the Blackwood tribe have long inhabited the area and have strong ties to the land. Their elder Shaman, Elder Brownpaw, wields great power over the elements -- his assistance would be invaluable.  See if you can obtain their aid. "
469,Protector of Ameth'Aran,Speak to Selenn at the Ruins of Ameth'Aran. ,"Nothing will repair the land quicker than the strength of those who inhabit it.  We night elves are fortunate that some of our best allies just happen to be both the land and its inhabitants at once. The Ancient of War known as Selenn was charged with guarding the ruins of Ameth'Aran, to the south.  Go there and seek his help. "
470,No Accounting for Taste,Retrieve a sample from a decomposing bear carcass east of Buzzbox 413. ,"<The machine buzzes for a few moments  before Wizbang's voice breaks through. >Interesting! The source of this corruption definitely came from something external--no surprises there--but it appears that in this case they've been eating something foul. A large mammal probably. Most likely a bear. Search the beach for a bear carcass for me. Slightly east of there would make the most sense, on the inland side of the beach. Bring me the sample back at town. "
471,The Defiler,Elder Brolg at Blackwood Hold wants you to kill Sharax the Defiler. ,"The Jadefire satyrs of Felwood have found their way into Darkshore, tainting the land, water, and creatures they encounter. You've seen what their corruption has done to my people and their homes. If we do not turn back the satyrs, all of us will share that fate. Within the cave to the east is Sharax the Defiler, the satyr responsible for the ills of the Blackwood. Slay him, <name>, and free us from his influence. Show the satyr that the Blackwood will not lay down and die so easily. "
472,Hero's Call: Darkshore! ,Report to Priestess Dentaria at Lor'danel in Darkshore. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Priestess Dentaria at Lor'danel in Darkshore. The people of Lor'danel need your aid in caring for the survivors of Auberdine's destruction and securing their town against Twilight's Hammer. Speak to Vesprystus, the hippogryph master at Rut'theran Village outside of Darnassus and he'll arrange a flight to Darkshore. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
473,Leaving the Dream,Speak to Malfurion at the Eye of the Vortex in Darkshore. ,"Hold on tight, <name>.  The journey back to the waking world can be a little rough on unprepared minds and bodies. "
474,The Devourer of Darkshore,Use the Lifebringer Sapling on the shore of the shallow lake south of the Grove of the Ancients to destroy the Devouring Artifact and its guardian. ,"Now that the creatures of Darkshore are safe, let's turn our attention to the artifact you found in the lake. I believe it's the work of a minion of the Old Gods. We'll fight these fiends using the very lifegiving energies of Darkshore itself! Take the Lifebringer Sapling to the shore of the shallow lake to the south of here. Wave it over the waters of the lake and it should disable that ancient artifact. Be careful, <name>. The artifact is likely to be guarded by who-knows-what. "
475,Power Over the Tides,Use the Orb of Elune on the remains of 6 Enraged Tidal Spirits. ,Do not worry about me.  My wounds are deep and death will soon come to me. It is all up to you now. . . you must stop the Twilight's Hammer. The Old Gods they worship have granted them power over the restless water spirits. . . but that power is tenuous.  Channel Elune's presence through this orb once the elementals have been defeated. Use the power of Elune to banish the spirits permanently. 
476,A Cure In The Dark,Retrieve 6 Samples of Foul Ichor from the creatures inside Cliffspring Hollow. ,"<Some unintelligible speech spews forth from the machine before you make out Wizbang's voice again. >Duskrats! They've been eating the duskrats! Those little buggers only come from one place, a cave against the cliff-face to the east. Find a path up to the northeast and look for an opening under the waterfall. The duskrats there are either getting into something nasty or someone's intentionally spreading some agent through them - in either case, just bring me back several samples of the stuff! "
477,Solace for the Highborne,Kill 6 Cursed Highborne and 6 Writhing Highborne. ,"I have come to Bashal'Aran to grant peace to the troubled spirits of the Highborne, but I find my hand hesitates with each blow. If you would like to aid me, you would have my gratitude. "
478,Unearthed Knowledge,Speak to Archaeologist Groff at Remtravel's Excavation. ,"Listen, <name>.  We need to learn more about what we're up against. To the southwest, beyond the Master's Glaive, there is a group of dwarven prospectors who were excavating the nearby ruins. Perhaps they have uncovered knowledge that is useful to us in this matter. "
479,The Front Line,Report to Huntress Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale. ,"Their forces are weakened, their supplies destroyed, and their subleaders are dead. It is time for us to take this fight to their home, and their leader. I'm admittedly still in the dark as to what spurred their sudden aggression, but perhaps we will find some answers on their doorstep. Take this arrow that Balthule prepared and report to Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale to join the attack. It would be best to secure a ride on one of our nightsabers - going on foot would be dangerous. "
480,Shatterspear Laborers,Kill 10 Shatterspear Laborers. ,"There are a large number of Shatterspear trolls picking through the ruins to the north and northeast. I suspect that they're looking for magical artifacts, but none of our scouts have reported the discovery of anything of significance turning up from their digs. They may well just be fueling their war. One thing is fairly certain though: less laborers would slow down their offensive, so less laborers is what they're going to get. You in? "
481,Strategic Strikes,Kill Sheya Stormweaver and Lorenth Thundercall. ,"Striking at the head of the beast doesn't work if there's another head to replace it. Before we can kill their leader, we need to kill the subleaders that may try to step up. Right now, they are not as well defended, and you should be able to best them without much support. Take this dryad spear and hunt them down. The poison on its tip should slow their incantations. My scouts reported one inside the water chamber in the ruins to the east and the other past the remains of the tower to the southwest. "
482,Cleansing the Afflicted,Elder Brolg wants you to use the Blessed Herb Bundle to cleanse 7 furbolg of Blackwood Hold and kill the Spirits of Corruption driving them mad. ,"With the sacred herbs and the bear's blessing, you must use this herb bundle to cleanse my brothers. The corruption spilling over from Felwood has driven them mad and they will attack any who come near. Expect the afflicted Blackwood to be angry with you until you have slain the spirits of corruption that haunt them. When you have freed my brothers from their madness, return to me. "
483,Aroom's Farewell,Obtain 8 Slain Wildkin's Feathers. ,<The creature hoots sadly as it addresses you. > Aroom is last of tribe. . . Others won't rest. . . need funeral pyre.  Bring Aroom the feathers of others. . . . let them rest. Then Aroom help you. 
484,Elune's Fire,Obtain Elune's Torch from Horoo the Flamekeeper. ,We need special flame for ritual.  We need Elune's fire. Horoo's spirit wanders east of here.  Horoo carries torch of Elune.  Bring here so spirits rest. Aroom thanks you. 
485,The Blackwood Pledge,Return to Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex. ,"It won't be immediate, but the elementals' anger will soon die down and my people will live to fight another day. I will go help you and Malfurion in any way that I can. "
486,Soggoth and Kronn,Return to Larien at the Grove of the Ancients with the information you've obtained. ,"The Master's Glaive was the site of an ancient battle, <name>.  The titans sent twenty of their stone giants against Soggoth. Of those twenty giants, one survived. The tablets say that Kronn, the largest of the stone giants allowed himself to be entangled by Soggoth's tendrils -- just long enough to be lifted close enough to the creature's skull. . . within reach of his mighty sword. It's a good thing he's dead. . . we don't really have twenty stone giants lying around to stop him again. "
487,Mutual Aid,Use the Soothing Totem to absorb the remains of 8 Unbound Fire Elementals. ,"With most of our brethren losing their way to madness or corruption, it would seem that we have little choice but to ally with you, <race>.  You can count on our aid. . . once you've proven we can count on yours. As you can see, my people are having a bit of a problem with the fire elementals.  Help fight them and use this totem on their fiery remains. We will return them to where they belong. . . whether they like it or not. "
488,The Boon of the Seas,Collect 16 Encrusted Clam Muscles. ,"It is good to see you. You were key in ensuring that our loved ones made it home, and I hold some hope that you may yet help us further. Like Laird, their wounds will be grave - every one of them battered by the coast and assaulted by the elementals. I am doing what I can, but it seems that those elementals hosted a toxin that is weakening their ability to heal. I believe I can concoct a salve, but I will need secretion from the muscles of the clams that inhabit this coast. Can you help me? "
489,An Ounce of Prevention,"Test the Lifebringer Sapling on any nearby healthy Grizzled Thistle Bear, Whitetail Stag, or Moonstalker Matriarch/Sire. ","Are you familiar with the Old Ones, <name>? Onu and I agree that the artifact you found in the lake can only be their work, and it's devouring Darkshore. Something is stirring up terrors we thought dead long ago. This is bigger than you or me, but my first concern is protecting the wildlife. Here, this sapling contains the life essence you gathered for me. I believe it can protect the local fauna. Test it out on a nearby un-consumed bear, stag, or moonstalker, and let me know what happens! "
490,The Wildkin's Oath,Return to Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex. ,"Wildkin with Elune. Aroom in your debt now. Aroom help you now.  Return to Malfurion, I join you soon. "
491,A New Home,Build a murloc hovel at a site Groff marked with a flag on the nearby shore. ,Can we build it? Yes we can! Just west of the dig site I planted a banner on the shore. The sand is firm and it's as good a site as any. Take my tools and the parts you collected and build these ornery pests a different place to live. 
492,Soothing the Elements,Place the Charged Soothing Totem at the top of the overlook in the Blazing Strand near the Flamestone. ,"Their fiery spirits are contained in the totem now. Take it to the top of the overlook in the Blazing Strand and set it on the ground. The totem's soothing energies will slowly wash over the elementals until their fury simmers down to calm. You must protect the totem, for fire does not react favorably to the ritual of soothing. "
493,The Darkscale Warlord,Slay Warlord Wrathspine inside Nazj'vel. ,"If the naga want to throw in their lot with the Twilight's Hammer, then may Elune have mercy on them. Go into their lair in the island of Nazj'vel and find their leader, the naga warlord known only as Wrathspine. Perhaps the horn of the ancients can still be saved. "
494,The Last Refugee,Escort Archaeologist Hollee to safety. ,"There was this massive earthquake and then everything went black. The next thing I know, I woke up here a prisoner. The whole place is overrun with air elementals! I hope that everyone's okay. These Twillight's Hammer scum better not have hurt any of my friends! Quick, <class>, use something sharp to jimmy the lock on this ball and chain. Together we should be able to make it to the refugee camp. "
495,The Tides Turn Against Us,Slay 8 Darkscale Myrmidons. ,"We cannot let the naga get away with this, <name>.  Slaying the keeper of the grove amounts to a declaration of war. You'll find their den inside a cave on the island of Naj'vel, far to the southwest. I want you to send them a clear message. "
496,Swamped Secrets,Find a Mud-Crusted Ancient Disc from within the nearby ruins. ,"Underneath Remtravel's forgetful exterior is the mind of a genius, an enigma cloaked in senility. But I'm not about to give up on the old man. Look at what I found in his notes. . . not there. . . no, that's a shopping list. . . Here, on the page where he's trying to figure out what year it is: The Disc! We think this Titan artifact is some sort of encrypted storage wheel. We were carefully unearthing it when the disaster hit, but hopefully it's still in the ruins. Dive in and grab it for me! "
497,Consumed,Kill 6 Consumed Thistle Bears and investigate the lake they're drinking from. ,"My first concern right now is for the thistle bear families who call what's left of these woods home. Just to our south, beyond the bear shrine, an entire generation has fallen ill. Gruesomely ill. <name>, I don't know what they're suffering from, but it's consumed them from within. It pains me that a whole generation is beyond saving, but we've got to kill them off so that the earth can reclaim their bodies. More importantly, we need to find the source. Investigate the shallow lake they drink from! "
498,Reason to Worry,Bring the Shatterspear Orders to Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze at the Ruins of Mathystra. ,"These appear to be orders dispatched to the overseers at the ruins from a superior in the Shatterspear War Camp. Most of the document contains negligible strategic value, but a couple lines stick out to you. ""We captured another night elf spying on our operation. She has been taken back to the camp to be tortured for more information. Keep an eye out for additional spies - we cannot afford for our operation to be compromised. ""The Lieutenant will surely want this information. "
499,Spirit of the Moonstalker,Keeper Karithus has instructed you to receive the blessing of the Great Moonstalker Spirit. ,"In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them. If you wish to align yourself with the Great Moonstalker Spirit, take this incense to the land just south of the Ruins of Lornesta. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me. "
500,Swift Response,Locate the night elf prisoners at the Shatterspear War Camp. ,"I have a scout that we lost contact with a couple days ago. I assumed her dead, but it appears that she's been captured. The trolls indicate that they have at least two captives though. . . the only other person that comes to mind is Alanndarian Nightsong, a civilian that was in the area against my advisement early yesterday. The Shatterspear have established a war camp to the north - it is almost certainly where any of their prisoners are being taken. Find them and free them if you're able. "
501,Spirit of the Stag,Keeper Karithus has instructed you to receive the blessing of the Great Stag Spirit. ,"In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them. If you wish to align yourself with the Great Stag Spirit, take this incense to the woods just north of Bashal'Aran. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me. "
502,The Slumbering Ancients,Find Aros northeast of the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore. ,"We may not have twenty stone giants to take on our enemy, but we giants of ancient lumber are as strong as any rock. Look around you, <race>.  My kindred sleep. . . yet they will heed the keeper's horn when the time of need is upon them. You will find Aros, the keeper of the grove, beyond the bridge northeast of here. Tell him the urgency of our situation. "
503,Breaking Waves of Change,Speak to Vesprystus in Rut'theran Village to secure a ride to Lor'danel. ,"It seems you have your first charge. You must travel back down to Rut'theran Village, where we first arrived, and speak to Vesprystus to secure a ride to Lor'danel. Once in Lor'danel, aid the night elves in any way that you are able. I am trusting you to treat them with the reverence that they deserve in light of all that they have done for us. I must travel to the distant city of Stormwind to meet with King Anduin. I hope to see your face again very soon, <name>. Until then, a fond farewell. "
504,What's Happening to the Blackwood Furbolg? ,Speak with Elder Brolg at Blackwood Hold. ,"Our ancestors lived alongside the Blackwood furbolgs for generations. But recently, we have lost contact with their settlements deeper in the forest. One of their larger villages, Blackwood Hold, can be found to the south. Travel there and find Elder Brolg. Ask him why his people have withdrawn from us and offer your help, if necessary. "
505,Unsavory Remedies,Recover 6 Fuming Toadstools. ,"I have no doubts that Grimclaw will recover with the help of my healing magics, though I can't say the same for the poachers that attacked him. Still, I could use some salve to close his wounds and lessen his pain while he heals. To the east you will find the Ruins of Lornesta. Among the crumbled stones, there is a variety of fuming toadstool that flourishes in the damp environment. Bring me some of the toadstools so that I can mix a salve for our friend here. "
506,Call Down the Thunder,Use Aetherion's Ritual Orb and obtain Aetherion's Essence. ,"Aetherion is almost in our world, but he can still be dealt with! At the end of the dock floats a ritual orb. I want you to use it to complete the ritual, beckoning the elemental lord down from his vortex. Trust me, <name>, I and the other spirits that you have freed will greatly weaken Aetherion. However, it will be up to you to finish him off for good and save the Kaldorei people of Darkshore from utter destruction. Deliver his essence to Corvine Moonrise at the refugee camp so he will know. "
507,One Bitter Wish,"Kill Rit'ko, the Shatterspear Torturer. ","Morra sent you? I should have listened to her - it's just hard to take trolls seriously I guess. <Alanndarian lets out a weak chuckle. >It's way too late for that anyway. We're mortal now. . . this is the fate we have to face, one way or another. I've had time to accept that. I have one request though. . . kill the torturer that did this to me. They call him Rit'ko. . . you can find him just ahead with the other prisoner. <Alanndarian offers a small smile, then winces and slumps back over in pain. >"
508,Twilight Plans,Obtain 6 Twilight Plans at the Twilight Encampment. ,"We're not fully aware of the intentions of the Twilight's Hammer cultists to the southwest.  We fear an attack on Lor'danel, however their motives might go well beyond that. I need you to go to the Twilight Encampment and get your hands on their plans.  Hurry, <name>.  We might not have much time. "
509,Spirit of the Thistle Bear,Keeper Karithus has instructed you to receive the blessing of the Great Thistle Bear Spirit. ,"In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them. If you wish to align yourself with the Great Thistle Bear Spirit, take this incense to a cave just east of the great whirlpool. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me. "
510,Calming the Earth,Kill 8 Enraged Earth Elementals. ,"I would be neglecting my responsibility if I abandoned my post just now, with so many elementals out of control in the ruins. Let us deal with them first, before we see how we can aid Malfurion.  What do you say, small one? "
511,Buzzbox 723,Gather 6 samples of Corrupted Thistle Bear Guts and bring them to Buzzbox 723 for analysis. ,"There are a couple other forms of wildlife that we've verified infected. It's actually good news that the crabs appear to have caught this from the bears - hopefully that means this all stems from one source. We need to focus our attention on those bears now. Buzzbox 723 is near the waterfalls to the east. It's going to be messy work, but it's necessary - I'll need you to bring some fresh bear guts to that buzzbox for analysis. We'll go from there once I have the information. "
512,A Troubling Prescription,Deliver the Apothecary's notes to Tharnariun Treetender in Lor'danel. ,"A crude, hastily-assembled apothecary's workbench stands here, heaped with scrawled notes and noxious brews. It looks as though the Forsaken have also been studying Foulhoof's handiwork. You grab the most important-looking notes and prepare to smash the laboratory before notifying Treetender of your discovery. "
513,Got Some Flotsam? ,Collect 5 pieces of Salvageable Greymist Wreckage from along the shore and in the water near the Remtravel Excavation. ,"We can figure this out, <name>. We just need some Dwarven ingenuity. Think, Groffy, think! These murlocs are just looking for a home, right? Let's do something constructive. I mean that literally. All sorts of debris was washed ashore during the catastrophe, and some of the decimated murloc hovels may still be salvageable. Run along the shore here and gather up any building materials fit for a murloc. That's an admittedly low standard. "
514,Against the Wind,Use the moonwell in the Ruins of Auberdine to destroy 8 sets of Frenzied Cyclone Bracers. ,"If we're going to take the Ruins of Auberdine back from the Twilight's Hammer, the elementals that they've summoned must be dealt with on a permanent basis. That's where you come in. Look, I don't expect you to retake the town, but while we're healing up here, you can soften them up for us. To permanently deal with the frenzied cyclones, head west, kill them, take their bracers, and put them in the moonwell. That will destroy the bracers and keep those elementals from being resummoned. "
515,Jadefire Braziers,Gren Tornfur at Blackwood Hold wants you to destroy 8 Jadefire Braziers. ,"The satyrs of Felwood have started pouring their hate and corruption into our lands. They have sent Sharax the Defiler to subdue parts of the forest that we Blackwood call home. In addition to poisoning the land, animals, and plants, he has set up Jadefire braziers throughout the village to help extend his control over our people. Destroying the braziers alone won't be enough to stop him, but it will help lessen his influence while you work with Elder Brolg to free our brothers. "
516,Sworn to Protect,Talk to Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex in Darkshore. ,"My duty here has been fulfilled as best it can.  Send word to Malfurion that I'll be joining him soon. Good luck to you, <name>.  Good luck to all of us. "
517,Grimclaw's Return,Return to Volcor and Grimclaw in Lor'danel. ,"With the binding complete, the blessing has taken hold. It will most certainly make your travels in these lands easier. Grimclaw made a full recovery. Before I could do anything to stop him, he bolted off towards Lor'danel. I suppose that means it's time for your departure. It was a great pleasure to have met you. For now, farewell - send my best wishes to Volcor and Grimclaw. "
518,Malfurion's Return,Look for Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex southeast of the Refugee Camp in Darkshore. ,"It was only recently that we heard the news of Malfurion's awakening, mere moments before the Cataclysm occurred. As soon as he regained consciousness, he gave a cryptic warning about the land splitting in two if something wasn't done and how all the shockwaves were converging here on Darkshore. He then reportedly set off for somewhere in this vicinity.  I was sent here to find him, but I've found my hands full helping the refugees. Perhaps you could look for him to the southeast for us. "
519,Writings of the Void,Bring the Writings of the Dark Herald to Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea at Lor'danel. ,"The scrolls are vague and appear to be a piece of a much larger puzzle, but if you are not mistaken, they seem to reveal some of the steps on the path to becoming a demon hunter. The dark oaths and rituals necessary for becoming a demon hunter are frowned on by most of the night elves, so this is likely something they would be very interested in keeping quiet. Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea will know what to do with these scrolls. "
520,The Last Wildkin,Speak to Aroom at the Moontouched Den north of the Eye of the Vortex. ,The wildkin were once numerous in Darkshore.  Such are their ties to the land that the Cataclysm that shattered Darkshore also decimated their numbers. The wildkin Aroom is the last of his tribe and is a powerful elder with a strong connection to Elune.  His help will be most necessary in healing the land -- you will find him north of here at the Moontouched Den. 
521,Mounting the Offensive,Speak to Balren of the Claw at the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore. ,"Our work in Darkshore is not yet done.  We might have stopped the landmass from shattering, but our enemies still have a strong presence in the area. I want you to contact a group of druids at the Grove of the Ancients, far to the south.  They are led by an old friend of mine, Balren of the Claw. Tell them that the time has come to take the battle to our foes.  I will come to aid them as soon as we stabilize the area. "
522,I Want It All,Defeat the Azerite Fury. ,"An elemental born of pure Azerite! I do not know what kind of threat this poses, champion. . . but please, do take care. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(52983))"
523,Three Hammers to Break,"Slay Cloudtamer Wildmane, Windmaster Tzu-Tzu, and Skylord Braax. ","I've flown through the ruins of Auberdine on a scouting mission. There are three Twilight's Hammer cultists that are responsible for the elementals that have overrun the destroyed town. Head west into the ruins. Seek out and slay Cloudtamer Wildmane, Windmaster Tzu-Tzu, and Skylord Braax. Only then will Sentinel Selarin and her forces stand a chance of taking back their home. "
524,Coaxing the Spirits,"Coax the spirits from Thundris Windweaver, Elissa Starbreeze, Taldan, and Caylais Moonfeather. ","Your friends back at the refugee camp are unaware of the true and imminent danger that the Twilight's Hammer cultists have already brought into the world. For you to deal with that, we'll first need to get some help from the dead of Auberdine. Search through the ruins of the town and find the corpses of Thundris Windweaver, Elissa Starbreeze, Taldan, and Caylais Moonfeather. Coax the spirits from their bodies and then return with them to me here. "
525,Sweeping Clean the Ruins,Kill 10 of any combination of Greymist Oracles or Greymist Refugees squatting within Remtravel's Excavation. ,"The big beards at Ironforge sent me here to check on Remtravel's dig the moment they got word of the disaster. Look at it! Precious artifacts washed to sea, months of tedious digging undone in a moment. When the tidal waves hit, they demolished the murloc encampments along the shore. Good news? Naw, not with my luck. The survivors are squatting in the shelter of the ruins, and they're doing more damage than the elements ever could. Would you mind getting your waders on and taking care of things? "
526,The Howling Oak,Speak to Genn Greymane at the Howling Oak in Darnassus. ,"So this is it. . . our new home. I'm not sure if I'll ever feel like I truly have a home again. We mustn't be unappreciative of what the night elves have offered us though. Their race is not one to throw out idle welcomes to just anyone. It is a true testament to faith and generosity that they've taken us in. Gwen and Greymane are in the city proper, at the Howling Oak. You should stop by. Take the portal beneath the tree north of us, then seek out the Howling Oak in the northern portion of the city. "
527,Learn to Ride in Darnassus,Return the pamphlet to Jartsam at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus. ,This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Jartsam. Jartsam can be found at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus. 
528,While You're Here,You are to scour the Valley of Spears to find 6 Defiled Relics. ,"The Maraudine have raided the Gelkis camps for many years, stealing anything they could get their hands on. One of their favorite torments is to take these relics of power which the Gelkis hold sacred, and bring them here to be defiled. The Gelkis clan would certainly be grateful if you were to find and destroy these defiled artifacts. "
529,Shadowprey Village,Karnum Marshweaver wants you to speak with Mai'Lahii. ,"Hello again, <class>. I have received news that Shadowprey Village is in need of some assistance. Our hands are more than full here, so I must call upon you to travel there and be of assistance to them. The village lies on the coast to the southwest of here. When you arrive, seek out the one named Mai'Lahii. "
530,Behind Closed Doors,You are to find Kherrah somewhere behind the doors to Maraudon. ,"You've discovered the location of Khan Shodo's daughter, Kherrah. She is being held behind the doors to Maraudon! The rescue attempt is certain to be risky, but if you seek the Gelkis clan's cooperation, you must free the Khan's daughter. "
531,Death to Agogridon,Defeat Agogridon. ,"Our goal is within sight, <name>! We can break the will of this demon army by bringing down the one who leads them. If we can succeed, Desolace will be ours! When you are ready, lead a group of centaurs through the pass to the south, into Shadowbreak Ravine. Find where Agogridon hides! I will gather the other khans and meet you there to face him in battle. "
532,Blubbergut,Mai'Lahii wants you to kill Blubbergut. ,"Ahoy, mon! You think you be able ta do something for da village here? Most whales we can handle fine, but there be a special whale out there that be too big for our spears. Blubbergut been gettin' bigger an' bigger - eatin' up the fish we use to live on! Get out there and find the thing, then make him pay for his gluttony! "
533,Delicate Negotiations,Khan Leh'prah wants you to place the Spear of the Kolkar Khan in the Fatherstone and defend it from the Magram until Khan Kammah appears. ,"There is but one way to win the trust and loyalty of the Magram. It must be beaten out of them. They have suffered many losses in their war against my clan. They now possess an unfamiliar land, where they struggle just to feed themselves. Now is the time to strike. Speak to me when you are ready, then ride in and plant my spear in the Fatherstone. If we can kill enough of them, their Khan will submit to our will. "
534,Deep Impact,Priestess Valishj wants you to find the Ancient Engravings of Neptulon. ,"Queen Azshara seeks entrance into the plane of water, for what I do not know. She believes that the ancients held the keys to finding its location. I have personally been charged with scouring the ruins in this region, and none shall rest until we discover the secrets we seek! Submerged just to the north are a concentration of ruins. Use this staff to search through the rubble. Return to me only when you have located that which we seek! "
535,Ghost Walker Post,Karnum Marshweaver wants you to speak with Maurin Bonesplitter. ,"Greetings, <class>. It is good to see that you still draw breath. The time has come for me to call upon your services. Just southwest of this glade stands Ghost Walker Post. There you will find a forsaken by the name of Maurin Bonesplitter. He may have a solution for one of the problems we face here. Speak with him and do what you can to assist him. "
536,Fish in a Bucket,Jinar'Zillen wants you to collect 5 Shellfish from the traps near Shadowprey Village. ,"I'll reward anyone who makes my life a bit easier. . . I enjoy doing as little as possible, mon! Below the docks here in Shadowprey Village, I've many shellfish traps.  If you're kind enough to do my work and collect me my shellfish, then I'll reward you with something you want. . . get my drift mon? "
537,Blood Theory,Collect 10 Blood-filled Leeches. ,"The land is not all that has changed in Desolace. Here, the wildlife has responded to their new environment in strange and sometimes exciting ways. I am particularly interested in the Rejuvenated Thunder Lizards that roam just to the west. I need a sample of their blood. You may begin helping me by using this jar of leeches on a few of them. Once they've filled on the blood of those beasts, return them to me. "
538,Hunting Brendol,Recover Brendol's Satchel. ,"I'm too busy collectin' artifacts to busy myself with much else, but there is a bit of an issue here I wouldn't mind sortin' out. There's a forsaken apothecary who's been pokin' around these parts for a while now. Normally, I'd ignore him, but three times now he's snuck into my camp and pilfered my supplies. . . . enough's enough! Find the thief and bring me whatever's left o' my things! "
539,The Karnitol Shipwreck,Find Karnitol's Chest in Desolace. ,"Greetings, friend. Have yerself a seat here. . . My first order of business is for the mage Karnitol--a noble of some sort in Stormwind. Seems his ship was attacked by sea giants while off the coast in the northwest of Desolace. He and his servants tried to bring one of his more valuable chests ashore, but when the sea giants attacked in droves, he chose to abandon it and teleport himself and his servants to safety. He wants us to find the chest and its contents, and return it to him in Stormwind. "
540,Firestarter,You are to create a Raging Vortex by defeating 7 Disciples of Elune in the presence of your firestorm. ,"You are now able to understand the script in which the journal was written. Along the runestone, it is explained that the monument's gemstones were imbued with the power to summon a firestorm. The storm could grow to be a mighty weapon either through sustained worship of Elune, or charged by spiritual energies of the fallen. Looking down upon the newly revealed ghosts of Elune's disciples, you reason that you have neither the time, nor the inclination to worship the goddess of your enemy. . . . "
541,Return and Report,You are to return to Cenarion Researcher Korrah at Ethel Rethor. ,"It is done! Together we were able to bring down a dangerous adversary. Neptulon himself shall hear of your exploits here, <class>. Allow me to extend you his thanks. . . You should leave now. This place will not remain safe for long. Soon, the naga will seek vengeance for their priestess. "
542,Kodo Roundup,Bring 3 Tamed Kodos and the Kodo Kombobulator back to Smeed Scrabblescrew at Scrabblescrew's Camp. ,"Bibbly thinks he is the only goblin in Desolace who knows how to make money.  Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me.  Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership. Take the kombobulator and use it on any ancient or aged kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me. "
543,Ghost-o-plasm Round Up,Collect 8 Ghost-o-plasms. ,"There's a valley to the southeast, the Valley of Bones, haunted by Magram ghosts.  Sounds scary, doesn't it?  Well think how scary it is to the Magram!  If we captured ghost energy from that place, I bet it'd be worth plenty to those centaurs. Here, take this crate of ghost magnets.  If you place one between the two big skeletons in the valley, the Dead Goliaths, then ghosts will wander to it.  Distance yourself, take out the ghosts and get their ghost-o-plasm --that's what we'll sell to the Magram. "
544,Elune's Gifts,Visit Elune's Relics in Sargeron. ,"Simply intolerable! Satyrs of all things, desecrating our sacred lands. . . Their days are numbered, <race>. I can assure you of that. As soon as we have the numbers, I shall lead a charge that will rid this land of the wicked creatures. For now, though, perhaps you could put my mind at ease? Travel just east of here to Sargeron and scour the ruins. Find the relics of Elune and ensure that they are in good condition. I'll pay you well for this favor. "
545,Mystery Solved,You are to bring the Ancient Engravings of Neptulon to Cenarion Researcher Korrah. ,"Your efforts have paid off. The great risks you have taken have proven worthwhile. You have discovered the object of the nagas' desire and their reason for overrunning the coast of Desolace. As for the engravings you've discovered, your duty is clear. . . "
546,The Karnitol Shipwreck,Find Karnitol's Satchel and return it to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace. ,"Intriguing. Well, we might not be without hope quite yet. Along that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet. If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches. "
547,Portals of the Legion,Banish 6 Portals at Mannoroc Coven and return to Felgur Twocuts at Ghost Walker Post. ,Here it is - the Hand of Iruxos. Got it from one of the Burning Blade leaders myself. You must possess it if the demon portals at Mannoroc Coven are to be banished. . . which is what I now ask you to do. With the demon threat increasing we must close these portals to stem the tide of demons to this world. 
548,Ethel Rethor,Cerelia at Furien's Post wants you to speak to Korrah at Ethel Rethor. ,"We have plenty of enemies in this region without raising the ire of the Cenarion Circle. When we established our post here, we were asked to keep a watch over one of their researchers. Korrah was last seen at the tower to the west. Do be a dear and pay her a visit. It's been some time since we've bothered to check on her. "
549,Bone Collector,Bring 10 Kodo Bones from the Kodo Graveyard to Bibbly F'utzbuckle at Kormek's Hut. ,"We're sitting on a goldmine here, I tell you - a goldmine! Kodo bones will change the world forever. . . I have customers making furniture, music instruments, and even blasting powder out of them. There's a caravan that comes by and picks up my Kodo bones and then sells them at Shadowprey Village.  If you can travel to the kodo graveyard south of here and bring me ten Kodo bones, I'll give you something in return.  Is it a deal? "
550,My Word is My Bond,Khan Kammah wants you to speak to Khan Leh'prah. ,"It would seem that we have no choice. As reluctant as I am to cooperate with the Kolkar, there is wisdom in the words of their Khan. You may give him my word that we shall lend our spears to the battle. "
551,Into the Fray! ,"Khan Leh'prah wants you to defeat 15 Burning Blade Warlocks, 3 Doomguard Invaders, and Priestess Than'darissa. ","For untold generations, the centaur clans have fought against one another, but no more. Because of your deeds, we stand here together fighting a common foe. We shall win our ancestral lands back from these demons, or we shall die as brothers. What of you, <name>? You have earned the right to fight alongside us. I have a group of my best centaurs for you to lead into battle. Will you take up the spear? "
552,Breakout! ,Kill the Magram Warden at the Magram Village. ,"It began with a dream that repeatedly warned me of the danger to come. I saw the demonic legions bearing down upon our kind, overrunning our lands. The dream has become real. The Burning Blade and their demon masters have pushed the Magram out of their lands in the south. In turn, the Magram have defeated my people and taken over our homes. The fight was ferocious. Only a handful of the Kolkar still live. I would ask that you visit what was once my land in the east, and free them from their prison. "
553,Nothing a Couple of Melons Won't Fix,You must gather 8 Melonfruit and squeeze their juices into the Cup of Elune at Sargeron. ,"The markings on the Sargeron ruins, combined with what you've gleaned from Furien's text make one thing clear: There is something special about the old fountain in the Sanctuary of Elune. It would seem that one could expect special power from washing their face in the fountain. First, of course, there would need to be something in the ancient fountain with which to wash. Pondering this problem, you spot a melonfruit at the base of a nearby tree. . . . "
554,Infernal Encroachment,Destroy 10 Lesser Infernals. ,"Listen up, now. An' lookie here. < Thargad points off to the east. >Yeh see them big green glowin' balls that be fallin' from the sky? Those be a nasty buncha demons roamin' the lands unchecked. Well, almost unchecked. . . I've been keepin' 'em on their toes, givin' 'em sumthin' ta think about. How 'bout you get over there an' pick up where I left off? "
555,A Time to Reap,Collect 10 Aloe Thistles. ,"No one knows better than the Cenarion Circle that this lush oasis could dry up as quickly as it appeared. We must take care not to interfere with the processes taking place here, but to support and preserve them, A new species of plant, very plentiful in the surrounding region, has appeared since the great change. Collect samples of these for me, that I might study them and learn what they have to teach us, "
556,Rerouted! ,Officer Jankie wants you to ride her mount to Nijel's Point and speak to Corporal Melkins. ,"Halt! On behalf of the Nijel's Point Guard, I am under orders to send all able-bodied allies to report directly to Corporal Melkins. I am not authorized to offer any other information. What I can offer is transportation. You are free to use my mount. It will deliver you directly. Dismissed. "
557,Putting Their Heads Together,"Collect 100 Bleached Skulls from Thunder Axe Fortress, then place them at the Burning Blade Summoning Circle, then kill Nazargen. ","So it's true. . . . The parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the Burning Blade have ever been known to possess. Clearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs! Perhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted. "
558,The Emerging Threat,Korrah wants you to speak to her when you are ready to be shown the Naga threat. ,"I am all that remains of my company, sent to monitor the many changes on this coast of Desolace. I have reported of the dramatic increase of naga here, but to no effect. My peers are focused on other crises, so I must ask you, a stranger, to assist me in my research. First, though, allow me to show you the threat we face. "
559,Ethel Rethor,Corporal Melkins wants you to speak to Korrah at Ethel Rethor. ,"We have recently received a plea for help from a researcher of the Cenarion Circle. We have no one we can spare to send, so I ask that you pay her a visit on our behalf. Korrah is posted near the ruined tower of Ethel Rethor, on the coast to the west. "
560,Blessings From Above,"You are to collect 10 pieces of Satyr Flesh from the various Satyrs in Sargeron, and place them on Elune's Brazier. ",You feel a deep connection to the distant past having partaken of the ancient blessing granted by this relic. You determine to make as much as you can of this divine gift. 
561,Wetter Than Wet,Defeat 5 Servants of Neptulon. ,"Neptulon's minions have arrived here and are doing all they can to thwart us. Clearly, they've discovered our motives. This only confirms my suspicion that what we seek is indeed somewhere in these ruins! These water elementals are no match for our forces! Take this trident and use it to destroy the worthless servants of the Tidehunter. When we find what we seek here, Neptulon himself shall fear for his life! "
562,My Time Has Passed,"Furien at Tethris Aran wants you to ride his Dragonhawk to Furien's Post and inform his sister, Cerelia of his death. ","<Weakly, Furien beckons you near and struggles to speak. >Careless. . . I was shot down by Alliance fire. . . You must. . . inform my sister. Take my mount, <race>. . . he'll bring you to her. . . < Furien expires. >"
563,Cenarion Property,Collect 7 Cenarion Supply Crates from the Magram Lands. ,"Since the demons have invaded their lands, the Magram have broken all ties with any outsiders. They are untrusting and hostile and have taken to stealing from others instead of providing for themselves. Many of our needed supplies have gone missing of late and we suspect that the Magram are to blame. Please, <name>, go to their lands in the east and search for our belongings. "
564,Translation,Sorrem wants you to find the Ancient Tablets. ,"It is true that Furien dedicated his last days to a special research project. What that was, he would not share with me. Fortunately, I was able to recover his journal, but it's written in a code that I cannot decipher. Perhaps there is a clue to its translation in the region to the east where he spent his time. Take the journal, <class>, and speak with Narimar when you are ready to investigate this mystery. "
565,Lay of the Land,Captain Pentigast wants you to speak to Vahlarriel in Nijel's Point. ,"Yes, yes. Welcome to Desolace, <race>. Sorry we had to be so insistent, but we're a small outpost, and there are big problems in this region - most of them quite urgent. Bottom line: We need all the help we can muster. To start with, our friend Vahlarriel over there has been getting pretty antsy, insisting that we send a contingent to visit the ruins to the east. Why don't you go introduce yourself. . . . "
566,Help for Desolace,Report to Officer Jankie at Tethris Aran in Desolace. ,"I've received a disturbing message from Nijel's Point in Desolace. It would seem as if the great upheaval has created some new problems for them, which they are ill-equipped to handle. I was given no further information. Report to Office Jankie in Desolace. She will direct you to Nijel's Point. Good luck, <name>. "
567,Cleansing Our Crevasse,"Use Maurin's Concoction to kill 10 Slitherblade Invaders, 10 Slitherblade Sirens, and 3 Sea Giants. ","I recognize this foul creation. It's a terrible disease that kills almost instantly, and in a most violent manner. Loathe as I am to employ such devices, I fear we have no choice here. As you of course know, the naga remain a serious threat to the region. The time has come for us to drive them back into the sea! When you are ready, Grimfeather will take you to the crevasse where they are preparing a violent assault. Use the concoction on the naga and their allies to make Desolace safe! "
568,Get Me Out of Here! ,Escort Melizza Brimbuzzle. ,"Get me out of here! I came up to the Valley of Spears to talk to the Maraudines.  I thought I could do a little business with them. . . but they don't want to talk!  I think they want to eat me! Get me out of here and my brother Hornizz will pay you big!  He's at our camp next to the kodo graveyard, to the east. Let's hurry, <name>.  Not two minutes ago I heard some centaurs talking about getting wood for their cookpot. . . "
569,To the Hilt! ,"You are to collect 20 Satyr Sabers from the weapon racks and various satyrs in the region, then place them upon the statue, Elune's Handmaiden. ","You immediately recognize this statue from a sketch in Furien's Journal. Though the words associated with the entry elude you, the sketch seems self-explanatory. After battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort. As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack. . . . "
570,All Becoming Clearer,Furien's Journal has directed you to find the ruined Palace of Elune in northern Sargeron. ,"Something has changed. . . perhaps a side-effect of Elune's cleansing ritual. While it's by no means perfect yet, your understanding of the ancient language in the journal has vastly improved. The ruins in the northern mountains of Sargeron appear to be the main focus of Furien's enthusiasm. Something there, he felt, would aid him in driving the Alliance from this region. You close the journal determined to find this ruin and discover its secrets. "
571,Satyrical Offerings,"You are to collect 10 pieces of Satyr Flesh from the various Satyrs in Sargeron, and place them on Elune's Brazier. ",You find it most amusing to think that this ancient relic is bestowing upon you a blessing meant for your enemies. You determine to make as much as you can of this unintentional gift. 
572,Delivery Device,Maurin Bonesplitter wants you to collect 3 Hollow Kodo Horns from Dying Kodo. ,"As fate would have it, there's a special deed that needs doing - one that will benefit the Cenarion Circle as well as myself. You see, <class>, I am under pressure to create a special. . . concoction, shall we say. I believe my work to be complete, but I need to have it tested to be certain. The target of this test is to be the naga, who threaten this region from the west. Their demise would surely aid the Circle. First though, I need a delivery device. Hollow horns from the dying kodo should do nicely. "
573,A Revenant's Vengeance,Hydronis wants you to mount him and defeat Priestess Valishj. ,"I am Hydronis, a servant of Neptulon the Tidehunter, Lord over all waters. Azshara and her sinister naga have arrayed themselves against my master, and seek a war with him. This is the first battle in what shall surely be a long struggle. I have fought bitterly, <race>, and have grown weary. It seems that my actions here have attracted the attention of their priestess. Alone, I haven't the strength to overcome her. but perhaps together, we may prevail. "
574,Portals of the Legion,Banish 6 Portals at Mannoroc Coven. ,"Here it is - the Hand of Iruxos. Got it from one o' them Burning Blade leaders myself. Powerful thing! See, yeh use it on demon portals and they just disappear! Spooky magic, but these be desperate times. . . The demons keep comin' at this rate, and my camp will get overrun before ya know it. Here ya go, now. Get on with it. "
575,You'll Know It When You See It,Find the Ancient Summoning Ritual in Thunder Axe Fortress. ,"With his dying breath, Kohor mentioned the summoning of a demon that could threaten the entire region. He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking. This cannot wait for the Alliance's invasion of Desolace to take shape. You must scour Thunder Axe Fortress for clues and bring an end to this potential threat. "
576,Peace of Mind,Sorrem at Furien's Post wants you to kill Kohor. ,"We are a forward post, charged with monitoring potential adversaries. Once the Horde launches its Desolace campaign, our work here will ensure that nothing takes us by surprise. Recently, one of our scouts was caught and sacrificed by the Burning Blade at their stronghold to the east. Since then, we've been assaulted with threats and taunts from a Burning Blade wretch named Kohor. Their days here are numbered, but I will pay handsomely for that one to be silenced now! "
577,Pulling Weeds,Kill 7 Uprooted Lashers. ,"With such an abrupt change to the ecology, it is to be expected that some of the flora and fauna don't react as well as we'd hope. The uprooted lashers are a troublesome example of this. Roaming the fields to the east and south they are a detriment to the region and must be disposed of. While you're about, please deal with any of these pests that you find. "
578,Going Deep,Use the Slitherblade Charm. ,"I have fashioned a charm that will allow you to infiltrate the naga, giving you the appearance of one of their own. With this disguise, you will be able to speak and understand their language. They will be unable to discern your true identity. But beware! The sharks and other sea creatures here will expose you for all to see. Avoid them at all costs. Now go. Speak to the Priestess of Azshara and do what you must to learn of their purposes here. "
579,Furien's Footsteps,The Ancient Tablets at the Shrine of Elune have directed you to visit three of the prominent ruins in Sargeron. ,"You can decipher bits and pieces of the text, but it will require extensive study before Furien's work becomes coherent. For now, as you look off to the northeast, you think you can make out some of the ruins depicted in the journal. From what you can tell, these ruins seem to have been of some significance to Furien's research. "
580,An Introduction Is In Order,Garren Darkwind at Karnum's Glade wants you to speak to Khan Leh'prah. ,"I have heard of your exploits here in Desolace, <name>. We are in your debt. I'm afraid I must involve you in yet another crisis, one more pressing than the rest. The landscape is not all that has changed here of late. Old conflicts have made way for new, more dire ones. I should allow our guest to explain further. . . . Khan Leh'prah is among the last of the Kolkar tribe that once possessed all of eastern Desolace. We found him near death on our borders. Listen to his words. "
581,Chipping In,Kill 5 Drysnap Crawlers and 5 Drysnap Pincers. ,"As you have no doubt noticed by now, the recent changes to the land have had many side-effects. Some of these are beneficial, while others pose serious problems. Just south of the village the local lobstrok are emerging from the sea and choking off the road to the village. Please, <class>, go and thin the numbers of this pest. "
582,Putting Their Heads Together,"Collect 100 Bleached Skulls from Thunder Axe Fortress, place them at the Burning Blade Summoning Circle, then kill Nazargen. ","So it's true. . . . The parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the Burning Blade have ever been known to possess. Clearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs! Perhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted. "
583,The Enemy of Our Enemy,Cenarion Researcher Korrah wants you to speak with Lord Hydronis. ,"You have done us a great service, <class>. While they remain an imposing force, your efforts have kept an important artifact from the naga. I shall write to my peers of your findings. Meanwhile, the water revenant on Ranazjar Isle has stood alone against a steady onslaught of naga. I would have you find him and determine if there is some way we can assist him. "
584,Heavy Metal,You are to collect 7 pieces of Element 116 and bring them to Bizby at Bizby's Caravan. ,"You have a strong feeling that this stone is somehow responsible for the region's refusal to accept the encroaching regrowth. Looking off to the west, you notice a trail of smoldering debris that appears to be related to this mystery. You surmise that clearing the debris might assist Thunk's efforts here. And who knows what this stuff might be good for? "
585,Calming the Kodo,Use the Kodo Concoction near 5 Enraged Kodos. ,"As you have by now witnessed, the rapid changes to this region can have both positive and negative effects on the native creatures. To the south and east of here, enraged kodo are a constant threat to anyone nearby. It's time to put my theory to the test. I've used the rejuvenated thunder lizard's blood in the making of this concoction. I'm hoping it will soothe the kodo when they eat it. Place it near an enraged kodo and make sure you do it from a safe distance! "
586,Warchief's Command: Desolace! ,Report to Furien at Tethris Aran in Desolace. ,"All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Furien at Tethris Aran in Desolace. The brave Horde warriors of Desolace need your help to beat back the armies of the Alliance and ancient demons. To reach Tethris Aran, travel south from the Charred Vale in the Stonetalon Mountains. Destiny calls! "
587,Official Assessment,Cenarion Researcher Korrah wants you to take Korrah's Report to Karnum at Karnum's Glade. ,"You have accomplished much in your efforts against the naga, <name>. But I fear it is not nearly enough. . . . This is my official assessment of the naga presence. I'm confident that my peers in the wildlands will take the necessary action. Bring this to Karnum at the glade in the center of the Cenarion Wildlands to the southeast. He will know what to do. Thank you, <name>. And farewell. "
588,Time For Change,Kherrah wants you to speak with Khan Leh'prah. ,< Kherrah listens to you as you explain recent events. >I agree with the words of the Kolkar Khan. The time for ancient grudges is over. It is a shame that it has taken a demonic crisis to unite the tribes. I shall return to my father and convince him to join your cause. You have my word that he will comply. Return to Khan Leh'prah and inform him that the Gelkis will be ready when called upon. 
589,Infernal Encroachment,Felgur Twocuts wants you to destroy 10 Lesser Infernals. ,"The demons are on the move, <race>! If nothing is done, we'll be overrun in a matter of weeks. I've just returned from Mannoroc Coven, where the infernals there are falling from the sky! We need to at least buy ourselves some time. Get down there and pick up where I left off! "
590,Ears Are Burning,You are to bring 25 Burning Blade Ears to Sorrem at Furien's Post. ,"Sorrem has made no secret of his disdain for the Burning Blade at Thunder Axe Fortress. Surely, proof of their demise would be of value to him. "
591,Avenge Furien! ,Cerelia wants you to speak with Sorrem at Furien's Post. ,"This cannot be! My dear brother - slain by Alliance scum! They must be made to suffer, <race>! Find a way to bring them pain! I shall not rest until it is so. . . Furien had been researching ancient artifacts in the eastern regions before his death. Speak to Sorrem. Perhaps he can direct you in my brother's footsteps. "
592,Ten Pounds of Flesh,"You are to collect 10 pieces of Satyr Flesh from the various Satyrs in Sargeron, and place them on Elune's Brazier. ","According to Furien's Journal, this ancient brazier was placed here for the performing of sacrifices. As far as you can make out from the entry, a blessing is bestowed upon the being who places the flesh of Elune's enemies on the brazier's burning embers. Looking around, you determine that the satyrs who now possess this region would likely qualify. "
593,You'll Know It When You See It,Sorrem at Furien's Post wants you to find the Ancient Summoning Ritual in Thunder Axe Fortress. ,"With his dying breath, Kohor mentioned the summoning of a demon that could threaten the entire region. He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking. This cannot wait for the Horde's invasion of Desolace to take shape. You must scour Thunder Axe Fortress for clues and bring an end to this potential threat. "
594,Three Princes,"Slay Rhoho, Sherik, and Jorreth. ","The Gelkis reside in southwest Desolace. They are just as stubborn as the Magram, and since they have not suffered war and relocation, they are considerably stronger. Humbling the Gelkis will require an extreme show of force. Khan Shodo and his three sons rule the clan. Shodo is aging, and suffers from old war wounds. He never leaves the depths of his cave. The strength of his rule lies in his sons. Slay them, and persuade the Khan to commit to our cause. "
595,Early Adoption,Place 3 Swoop Eggs in Swoop Nests and protect them until they are collected. ,"As the region becomes more lush, the creatures of the desert are being forced into increasingly confined spaces. A particularly distressing result is the impending extinction of the local swoops. Predators feast on the birds and their eggs when they take nest. I have acquired some swoop eggs from Tanaris and coated them with an irresistible pheromone. Place one in each nest you find, then protect it until a swoop comes to carry it off. You will be doing a service to the balance of this land. "
596,Stubborn Winds,Destroy 5 Whirlwind Stormwalkers. ,"The winds of change are blowing, <race>. Of that there can be no doubt. There are many pressing issues vying for our attention and action. Chief among them is the spreading of our growing oasis. Its growth has surpassed our hopes as well as our understanding, yet now it faces opposition. To the west, where the grass meets the sand, whirlwinds prevent its penetration into the desert. Go and eliminate this hostile obstacle to life! "
597,Fletch Me Some Plumage! ,Collect 25 Dread Swoop Feathers. ,"Say, <class>, while you're out there exploring the desert wastes, do me a favor? Keep an eye out for Dread Swoops. Their oily feathers make for the best fletching, and to the right buyer they can fetch a handsome price. Lucky for you, I know all of the right buyers! "
598,Will Work For Food,Collect 5 Basilisk Flanks. ,"< Khan Kammah listens as you explain the demonic threat, and Khan Leh'prah's visions. >No one need lecture us about the demons, <race>. It is they who drove our clan from our ancestral lands. It is they who forced us to take over the Kolkar wastelands, where we struggle just to exist. The war against the Kolkar took a heavy toll on my people. What few of us remain are weary and hungry. Bring food for my people and then we shall discuss the demons. "
599,Smeed's Harnesses,Nataka at Ghost Walker Post wants you to deliver Smeed's Harnesses to Smeed. ,"Pardon me, young <race>. I'm in need of a little help. I've just finished filling an order for harnesses that must be delivered right away. I'm a bit old for the trip, especially considering how dangerous things have become lately. Would you mind? They need to go to Smeed, a goblin who lives just southeast of here. "
600,Peace of Mind,Kill Kohor. ,"We are a forward post, charged with monitoring potential adversaries. Once the Alliance launches its Desolace campaign, our work here will ensure that there are no surprises. Recently, one of our scouts was caught and sacrificed by the Burning Blade at their stronghold to the west. Since then, we've been assaulted with threats and taunts from a Burning Blade wretch named Kohor. Their days here are numbered, but I will pay handsomely for that one to be silenced now! "
601,Slitherblade Slaughter,"Collect 10 Slitherblade Bones from Slitherblade Naga, 30 Slitherblade Scales from Slitherblade Sorceresses, and 4 Slitherblade Fins from Slitherblade Warriors. ","Time and again, the naga have proven to be enemies to the balance of nature. I have no qualms with the spilling of their blood. Your best efforts though, would barely put a dent in their forces here. Where one falls, two seem to rise in their place. I have a plan, <class>. Your objective is not merely to take the lives of the enemy, but to gather components necessary for the next stage of our investigation. . . . "
602,Taking Part,Use the Cenarion Seeds next to 5 of the Fertile Mounds around the Cenarion Wildlands. ,"What a glorious time we live in! The former wastelands of Desolace are blooming, bursting with life. Imagine, <class>, if all of Azeroth's wastelands awoke in such a fashion! Perhaps someday. . . It's true that there are weighty issues at hand here, but why not take a moment to appreciate the wondrous miracle we are witnessing? In fact, why not take part in it? Here are some Cenarion Seeds. Use them at the more fertile spots of the wildlands. Perfect medicine for lifting a weary soul! "
603,An Impactful Discovery,Take the Mysterious Concoction to Karnum at Karnum's Glade. ,"< Thargad rummages through the satchel and pulls out a curious object. >Well now, this is odd. . . it's a hollow kodo horn with some sort of potion inside. < Thargad sniffs the potion. >WHEW! Definitely not any kind of healthy elixir. This mess is meant for one thing. . . killin'. How 'bout yeh run it back up to Karnum and see if there's anything he can do with it. . . "
604,Jugkar's Undoing,"You are to use the Infernal Power Core to take control of Lord Azrethoc at Jugkar's Altar, and use its powers to slay Jugkar Grim'rod. ","You recognize this as the essence of a summoned demon. Dangerous and rarely understood energies weave in and out of its surface. As you gaze upon it, a vision fills your mind - an image of yourself controlling demonic minions. A rush of excitement flows through you as you imagine wielding such power. Looking at your surroundings, you wonder how this treasure might be used against this demonic enemy. . . . "
605,Stubborn Lands,Thunk at Thunk's Abode wants you to find the Unnatural Outcropping. ,"By authority of the Cenarion Circle, I am charged with turning these harsh lands into lush prairie. The lands south of here welcomed the growth, but something here is fighting back - resisting the replenishment. Perhaps your eyes can succeed where mine have failed. Please, <race>. Scour these lands and discover the source of the desert's stubbornness. "
606,To the Hilt! ,Collect 20 Satyr Sabers from the weapon racks and various satyrs in the region. ,"The handmaiden of Elune! It's even more glorious than the stories tell. The legends surrounding this relic come to your mind as you draw near it: In ancient time, after battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort. As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack. . . . "
607,Rock Lobstrock! ,Get 7 Tender Lobstrock Tails. ,"Thargad works practically nonstop chasing after ancient Titan relics. He stays so busy that if it weren't for me, he'd probably forget to eat! Speaking of eating, I'd like to prepare him something special - perhaps you could help me out? Lobstrock roam all over the coast to the west. I'd never last in a fight with them myself, but I could make a great meal if you were to bring me some of their tails! "
608,The Karnitol Shipwreck,Return to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace. ,"You take a few moments to figure out what pried the chest open, and you notice along the sides and top of the chest, long, deep scratches that reveal that something other than a man or giant took interest in it. The marks don't appear as if they were caused by dagger or sword. After going through the chest you find it to be completely empty. Not having another course of action, you close the chest and prepare to leave. Kreldig will be disappointed. "
609,Nothing a Couple of Melons Won't Fix,Gather 8 Melonfruit. ,"The markings on the ruins here make one thing clear: There is something special about the old fountain in the Sanctuary of Elune. It would seem that one could expect special power from washing their face in the fountain. First, of course, there would need to be something in the ancient fountain with which to wash. Pondering this problem, you spot a melonfruit at the base of a nearby tree. . . . "
610,Jugkar's Undoing,"You are to use the Infernal Power Core to take control of Lord Azrethoc at Jugkar's Altar, and use its powers to slay Jugkar Grim'rod. ","You recognize this as the essence of a summoned demon. Dangerous and rarely understood energies weave in and out of its surface. As you gaze upon it, a vision fills your mind - an image of yourself controlling demonic minions. A rush of excitement flows through you as you imagine wielding such power. Looking at your surroundings, you wonder how this treasure might be used against this demonic enemy. . . . "
611,Thargad's Camp,Karnum Marshweaver wants you to speak to Thargad. ,"It pleases me to see that you still draw breath, <class>. I have been sent word that the demon activity in the south has been intensifying. There is a camp on the borderlands there that is in danger of being cut off if the demons move northward. Perhaps you could lend them a hand? I know the leader of the camp there is Thargad. He will be able to direct you wisely. Thank you, friend. Be well. "
612,Good Gold For Bad Tail,Find 15 Aged Basilisk Tails. ,"I need a crateload of tail, <class>! And not just any kind of tail. The tail I'm after needs to be old - ancient even. The more decrepit the better. The scales of a basilisk's tail are unique in that they harden with age without becoming brittle. The hardened scales are ideal for the production of certain armors. It's been many years since I've been reduced to peddling lizard scales, but who knows, maybe it'll build even more character in me! If that's even possible. . . . "
613,Not So Fast! ,Khan Shodo wants you to kill 10 Maraudine Maulers in the Valley of Spears. ,"<The Khan of the Gelkis clan stares at you with an empty gaze as you detail the demon threat and Leh'prah's visions. >It matters not to me what becomes of this land now. I have failed my clan and my forefathers. . . . There is but one thing left in this world that might bring my old soul hope, and she's likely dead as well. My precious daughter, Kherrah, was taken from me by the Maraudine clan. If you can bring her back to me alive, I shall consider your proposal. "
614,Ten Pounds of Flesh,Collect 10 pieces of Satyr Flesh from the various satyrs in Sargeron. ,"According to ancient legend, this ancient brazier was placed here for the performing of sacrifices. From what little you remember of the stories, a blessing is bestowed upon the being who places the flesh of Elune's enemies on the brazier's burning embers. Looking around, you determine that the satyrs who now possess this region would likely qualify. "
615,Maurin's Concoction,Maurin wants you to deliver Maurin's Concoction to Karnum at Karnum's Grove. ,"<Maurin carefully seals his concoction into the hollow kodo horns. >Here you are, <class>. Bring these to Karnum. It's up to him how he wants to use them on the naga. I'll be watching to gauge the effectiveness of my formula! "
616,Cleansing Our Crevasse,"Karnum Marshweaver wants you to use Maurin's Concoction to kill 10 Slitherblade Invaders, 10 Slitherblade Sirens, and 3 Sea Giants. ","As you of course know, <name>, the naga remain a serious threat to the region. The time has come for us to drive them back into the sea! When you are ready, Grimfeather will take you to the crevasse where they are preparing a violent assault. Once there, use Maurin's Concoction to teach them a lesson they shall not soon forget. "
617,Ears Are Burning,Collect 25 Burning Blade Ears. ,"Captain Pentigast has made no secret of his disdain for the Burning Blade at Thunder Axe Fortress. Surely, proof of their demise would be of value to him. "
618,Hero's Call: Desolace! ,Report to Officer Jankie at Tethris Aran in Desolace. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Officer Jankie on the road into Desolace at Tethris Aran. The brave soldiers of Nijel's Point are beset by demons and the armies of the Horde, and they need your help.

622,Nothing Left for You Here,Speak to Furien at Tethris Aran in Desolace. ,"There is nothing left for you here, <name>. As for me, I must lay Masha's body to rest. Once I have done that I will go to the bombing site and begin the process of regrowth. Perhaps one day a new grove will bloom - a grove infused with the spirit of my child and the fallen night elf youths. If you wish to travel to Desolace, I hear word of a blood elf named Furien seeking adventuring partners. Perhaps you should seek him out. Farewell, friend, I will never forget you. "

625,Securing the Lines,Kill 12 Durotar Harpies. ,"Gazlowe told me once, "" Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself. ""I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Harpies plague our supply routes.  If we kill the harpies, the caravans are safe. Of course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's ""You can get anything done for a price. "" You in, <name>?  Good. . . I recommend starting in the canyon to the east. "
626,Margoz,Speak with Margoz. ,"One of our more useful shaman, Margoz, knows more of the Burning Blade's corruption.  He speaks of a cave called Skull Rock in the mountains, just outside Orgrimmar, that shelters a large band of Burning Blade cultists. Before you go to Skull Rock, speak with Margoz.  He is wise and his council is valued. He is camped to the southeast, between the coast and Drygulch Ravine. Follow his advice, but whatever Margoz says, <name>, I still want you to crush those cultists! "
627,Meats to Orgrimmar,Bring Grimtak's Meats to Burok in Razor Hill. ,"I have some choice cuts of meat that I want to send to a friend.  Her name is Gryshka, the innkeeper in Orgrimmar.

628,Warchief's Emissary,Deliver the Sealed Package to the Darkspear Loyalist on the docks at Bladefist Bay in Durotar. ,"The goblins and the Horde have accomplished too much together to part ways now, <class>. I intend for the Bilgewater Cartel to become part of the Horde. I have something that I want you to deliver to the new warchief. Give this package to my Darkspear friend on the dock at Bladefist Bay in Durotar. She will help you to get into Orgrimmar safely.

629,Lost But Not Forgotten,Obtain 250 Crocolisk Teeth. ,"Today marks the anniversary of my son Kron's passing.  As long as I refused to admit it, I recognize now: Kron is not returning from his crocolisk hunt. I've been working on a project. . . something that will memorialize Kron's passion for the hunt.  It's a crocolisk-tooth necklace. . . rows and rows of teeth, suitable to be worn by only the bravest young orc.  I will place it on his grave. Kron was brave, but he was not strong, like you.  Will you bring me the teeth for my necklace? "
630,To Be Prepared,Visit Horde forces in Dranosh'ar Blockade. ,"Our allies have made the journey to Orgrimmar to support our war efforts.

Stop and visit with them, <name>. Their assistance will secure our victory today. "
631,The Battle for Broken Shore,Take Captain Russo's ship to the Broken Shore. ,"Your warship awaits at the end of the dock, <name>. May your weapon bring you many kills today.

The Warchief has already made landfall, I will wager you will simply need to follow the trail of demon blood. "
632,Unbidden Visitors,Attack 3 Wayward Plainstriders until they flee toward the Barrens. ,"Don' worry, Zen'Taji 's not in any trouble.  He just been studyin' what happens when the river overflows. Ya see the big tall birds that stand on the riverbank? Zen'Taji thinks they're in trouble.  The earthquake and the flood pushed the plainstriders over to this side of the water, but they can't fly back, and they're too scared to swim. They'll die if they stay here. Zen'Taji doesn't like violence, but maybe YOU can attack them and scare them over to the other side.  Yes? "
633,Demons Among Us,Learn what Allari the Souleater sees. ,"Look around.

634,The War of Northwatch Aggression,Destroy the 3 sets of Attack Plans held within Northwatch Foothold. ,"These humans in the west, they don't just wanna camp out in Durotar, mon.  They got bigger plans, and those plans involve takin' our home and leavin' our skulls on pikes. Well I'm not havin' it.  Nope!  Not Lar!  I've got family here in Sen'jin, and I'll be damned if I let one of those brutes put my Tai'tasi's head on a stick! They've got their plans written down in there, mon.  Big scrolls, real important-lookin'.  We gonna burn those scrolls before they burn us. "
635,Lost in the Floods,Use Thonk's Spyglass to search for survivors in Southfury Watershed. ,"The recent cataclysmic events have done more than wash a few boats onto our shore, <class>.  The Southfury River has overflowed, and Durotar 's entire western basin is now flooded. There are still people out there.  I've been searching for a while, but haven't been able to find anything.  Would you mind using my telescope and taking a look for yourself? "
636,Return to Razor Hill,"Buy a wind rider to Razor Hill from the wind rider master Doras, then bring Gryshka's Letter to Grimtak at Razor Hill. ","My wind riders are trained to fly to many different places, as long as you have already been to that place and spoken with the wind rider master there.

638,From Bad to Worse,"Kill 6 Northwatch Marines, 6 Northwatch Sharpshooters, and Lieutenant Palliter in Tiragarde Keep. ","Tiragarde Keep lies to the southeast of here, on Durotar 's eastern shore.  You probably passed it on your trip from Sen'jin Village.  This castle has been a thorn in my side for too long. Humans from Kul Tiras lived in the castle for years, thwarting my every attempt to crush them.  When the cataclysm hit us, the shore was wiped out, along with the castle and all the humans.  However, these upstarts from Northwatch have moved in to take their place! < Gar'Thok roars in aggravation. >"

He'll give you a ride to Razor Hill.  His wolves know the path well. "
641,Arnak Fireblade,Bring an Example Collar to Arnak Fireblade in Orgrimmar. ,"The Searing Collars you brought me are powerful demonic implements.  Divining their origin is, I'm afraid, beyond my skills as a shaman.  We will need a warlock to study them. Take a searing collar to Arnak Fireblade.  Although he is a skilled warlock, he professes to use his powers to thwart demons, and claims his research in the occult is benign.  Be that true or false, we may need his aid against the demonic cult in Durotar. You may find Arnak in Orgrimmar in the Cleft of Shadow. "
642,That's the End of That Raptor,Slay the raptor called Screamslash. ,"Many creatures died when the water came rushin' into the valley.  The raptors, however, thrived.  They're clever predators, and they've been living off the misfortune of the other creatures. One of the raptors is particularly cruel.  He's killing the little animals and letting them rot in the water without even eating them!  He goes by the name of Screamslash, and if we're not careful, he could seriously disrupt the balance of nature. Travel north, slay him, and give his body back to nature. "
643,Doras the Wind Rider Master,Bring Gryshka's Letter to Doras in Orgrimmar. ,"I've written a letter of thanks to Grimtak.  Will you deliver it for me?

But don't you worry, Bom'bay 's not gonna let you get hurt! Bom'bay 's got a big totem that you gonna stick in the ground when the scorpion strikes.  The totem gonna suck up all the poison, and you gonna walk away still breathing.  Sound good? "
645,Emissary,Speak with Allari the Souleater. ,"As if things weren't unsettled enough, guests have arrived. . . the Illidari. These demon hunters have been imprisoned since their master's fall at the Black Temple. For the Wardens to release them can only mean the peril is dire indeed. Their delegation's leader, Allari ""the Souleater, "" claims Orgimmar faces a hidden threat. I gave them leave to establish a camp within the city. . . for now. You will speak with her at once. Find out whether this threat is credible. "
646,Breaking the Chain,Destroy 3 Northwatch Supply Crates and kill 10 Northwatch Lugs. ,"Aw man, this ain't good.  Not one bit, mon. Thrall's off to sea, Vol'jin's taking care of business in Echo Isles, and old Master Gadrin is left behind to take care of Sen'jin.  And then what happens?  Those humans come outta Northwatch Hold and set up camp in our backyard! Lucky for us, they just got here, and they're still setting up their base.  You can help out old Gadrin by destroying those big supply crates they carry, and by killing the laborers carryin' them. You'll find'm to the southwest. "
647,Second Sight,Use your Spectral Sight. ,"Sylvanas becoming Warchief may be problematic. In life she was a proud ranger, known to many in our ranks. But since the Scourge took her, some of her own allies do not trust the Banshee Queen. The Legion will strike at the first hint of dissension. Even now, I sense something amiss, <name>. I fear that not all is as it seems. Quickly, use your Spectral Sight. We must know if there are foes among us! "
648,Fizzled,Obtain Fizzle's Orb from Fizzle Darkclaw in Thunder Ridge. ,"The flood to the southwest wiped out one of the few Burning Blade camps that still pockmark Durotar.  This one was led by a goblin named Fizzle Darkclaw, and believe me, we're better off without him. Darkclaw, however, did possess an orb that the Horde is interested in procuring.  Who knows why. . . I leave that to the warlocks.  All I know is that I need that orb. "
649,Loss Reduction,Rescue 4 Injured Razor Hill Grunts. ,"You've got to help us.  The elementals. . . they're stronger than they look, and they come in waves.  They took us completely by surprise, and we were overcome. Many of my fellow grunts lay dying on the beach.  If you could save them. . . I would be grateful, as would Gar'Thok back in Razor Hill. "
650,Cleaning Up the Coastline,Obtain 5 handfuls of Crawler Mucus. ,"Heya mon! Bom'bay be workin' on some new mojo.  You wanna try a piece of it?  Well, before ya do, Bom'bay 's gonna need ya to pick up some jujus. First, Bom'bay needs ya to get some o' the goop from the crabs down by the water.  Let me see your hands! < Bom'bay examines your hands closely. > Bom'bay gonna need 5 handfuls.  Go on now! "
651,Exploiting the Situation,Obtain 6 pieces of Kul Tiras Treasure. ,"<Hey there, handsome!  I've had my eye on those big, beefy biceps ever since you stepped into town. /What're you looking at> ugly?  I've seen you walking around Razor Hill, trying to steal MY men from me! ; Listen, I've got something for you to do.  I hear Gar'Thok's got you headed over to Tiragarde.  While you're there, think you could find some abandoned Kul Tiras knicknacks? <Thanks sweetie! /Don't ask why> just get to it! ; "
652,The Battle for Broken Shore,Take the wind rider to the Broken Shore. ,"This wind rider will take you to Broken Shore, <name>. May your weapon bring you many kills today.

The Warchief has already made landfall, I will wager you will simply need to follow the trail of demon blood. "
653,Purge the Valley,Defeat 12 Northwatch troops in Northwatch Foothold. ,"Northwatch is a highly-defended stronghold southwest of here, across the harbor.  It's a strategically-located stronghold that the Horde still struggles to overtake.  We don't need the humans setting up another Northwatch here in Durotar. Sweep through the valley to the west and slay these humans, <name>.  Let them know the power and the fury of Sen'jin. "
654,Ignoring the Warnings,Destroy 12 Warring Elementals. ,"Ignore the shaman, soldier.  Certain powers-that-be within the Horde demand that I keep him with me, but I assure you, that Thrall-loving farseer truly sees no farther than the borders of this hut. Elementals war against one another to the west of here.  I normally wouldn't mind, but I need that land clear to secure a broader shipping route to and from the Barrens.  The elementals are normally quite strong, but they are weakened by their attacks against one another.  Use this knowledge to destroy them. "
655,Raggaran's Fury,Kill 5 Razormane Dustrunners and 5 Razormane Battleguards. ,"I will not rest until they're defeated!  Slay them all! < Raggaran catches his breath. >Their stinking lairs are to the north, or to the southwest! "
656,Thunder Down Under,Attach a Mageweave Tether to 8 Drowned Thunder Lizards in Thunder Ridge. ,"Our army needs water, and luckily the elements gave us plenty of that when the cataclysm hit.  The water that filled up the canyon to the southwest should do the trick. Unfortunately, the corpses of thunder lizards still sit at the bottom of the canyon, and their electrical discharges are a bit too dangerous.  I've got grunts that can lift them out of the water, but we need someone agile enough to attach the other end of the rope.  Are you my <man/woman>, <name>? "
657,Shipwreck Searching,Obtain 4 sets of Gnomish Tools. ,"<Hey handsome, welcome back!  You wouldn't mind running another errand, would you?  I'd be EVER so grateful. . . /You!  Stop right there> you tramp!  I'm not finished with you yet. ; I hear you're headed off to the shore east of here.  The beach is filled with crashed ships, and those ships have gnomish tools in them. . . tools that I can use. <See you soon, beefcake! /Get cracking> missy! ; "
658,Raggaran's Rage,Kill 4 Razormane Quilboar and 4 Razormane Scouts. ,"The quilboar are a stain on the land that not even the river can wash away.  They told me to evacuate, but I told them that my job was not yet done. Hrrrraaagh!  I hate quilboar so much!  Will you help me kill them? "
659,Watershed Patrol,Search the Southfury Watershed and help the people you saw in the spyglass. ,"My post is here on the tower, <name>, and I cannot leave it.  I need someone to go out there and help the people who are still trapped in the river's overflow. Can I count on you? "
660,Learn to Ride in Durotar,Return the pamphlet to Xar'Ti at Sen'jin Village in southern Durotar. ,This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Xar'Ti. Xar'Ti can be found at Sen'jin Village in southern Durotar. 
661,Gaur Icehorn,Defeat Gaur Icehorn in combat. ,"I wouldn't normally keep a taunka as a captive, due to their close relationship with the Horde. . . but this one is a traitor, and a criminal to boot.  Exiled by his own tribe, he canoed down to Azshara and was found stealing supplies from Valormok.  He would have been put to the axe had I not been standing by, wallet in hand. Gaur is my winningest gladiator, <class>.  I'll bet you a fist full of silver that you can't beat him. "
662,Storming the Beaches,Kill 11 Foaming Sea Elementals. ,"Now that those humans are out of our hair for a bit, we can move on to more pressing matters. The cataclysm utterly decimated Durotar 's eastern coast.  You saw the wreckage that it made of Tiragarde.  The devastation was even worse on the coast to the east of here. After the first wave, the beach was overtaken by angry elementals that came from the sea.  I sent grunts to take care of it, but the onslaught was too much.  I'm guessing you'll have a little more luck than they did. Beware the tides! "
663,Thonk,Report to Thonk on the guard tower northwest of Razor Hill. ,"<Oh, sweetie, I just remembered! /Sorry if I've been mean to you.  Sometimes I get a little jealous when other women come into town> as I'm a little insecure about my appearance. ; My VERY good friend Thonk works in the guard tower on that cliff, just to the northwest of Razor Hill.  He said something about a river overflowing, lots of work to be done, and so on.  I wasn't really paying attention. . . I was staring into those deep brown eyes of his. <What, we can't see other people? /Thanks. >"
664,Ghislania,Defeat Ghislania in combat. ,"I own a couple gladiators that I put into competitions around Kalimdor.  You can see most of them chained up around here. . . we were lucky to rein these ones in after the cart broke down. Ghislania, that naga over there. . . she's lost her last three fights.  She could use a tune-up, or maybe just a little bit of thrashing.  Go challenge her, I'll bet even YOU are stronger than she is. "
665,Griswold Hanniston,Defeat Griswold Hanniston in combat. ,"Griswold, chained up over there on the cliffs, is my newest gladiator.  We found him just south of here, sniffing around with Northwatch soldiers.  I had my men nab him up, and now he works for me. He looks tough enough, but he hasn't really been battle-tested yet.  Go pick a fight with him so I can see if he's worth keeping around. "

670,Sent for Help,Report to Spiketooth at Deadeye Shore in Durotar. ,"You, <race>, stop a minute. My boss Spiketooth sent me to look for help and supplies.  You don't appear to be a merchant, but you can probably still help him out.  He's just to the southeast of here, next to the crashed cart.  Oh, and tell him I sent you. . . I want to make sure that he knows I'm not just slacking off over here. "

674,Recover the Cargo! ,Collect 1 Salvaged Strongbox. ,"Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though. The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce. "
675,Corrosion Prevention,Moxie Steelgrille wants you to dissolve 10 oozes and report back to her at Beezil's Wreck. ,"Just look at this area! It's swarming with oozes. If I don't find some way to keep them under control, they'll corrode the wreckage and the zeppelin's cargo! I can't go back empty-handed, <class>! Help me dissolve these oozes before they've digested everything! This device, when powered, will concentrate energy on the slimes, causing them to explode. The zeppelin's fragmented power core should power the device. The one near the main crash works all the time, but the others flicker on and off. "
676,Deadmire,Bring Deadmire's Tooth to Melor in Thunder Bluff. ,"Deadmire is an ancient crocolisk in Dustwallow marsh.  And it is his time to die. Old bones grind as he pulls his huge body through the swamp, and although he still moves with the strength and speed of youth, his aging body tortures the great spirit within it, a spirit whose flame will not waver. Yet now he lives in constant, maddening pain.  You must end the life of this noble creature, <name>.  You must lead Deadmire to peace. "
677,The Grimtotem Plot,Collect 4 Grimtotem Notes from Grimtotem Elders and combine them to form the full Grimtotem Battle Plan. ,"With the activities of the Grimtotems in Thousand Needles brought to light, many tauren now regard them with suspicion.  We've seen high-ranking Grimtotems engage in murder and kidnapping to advance their interests and I fear we may become their next target. Blackhoof Village, to the northeast, near Bluefen, is a large new Grimtotem settlement. Their leaders, the elders, will all have orders from Thunder Bluff. See if you can capture the orders and piece them together to learn the Grimtotems' plans. "
678,Challenge to the Black Flight,Plant the Stonemaul Banner near the entrance to Onyxia's Lair and defeat anyone who answers. ,"Brogg relishes the thought of taking his revenge on the black dragonkin of the marsh. <name>, you have been very helpful in preparing for this moment. Will you help? Take Brogg 's clan banner and travel east until you see a cave like a dragon's mouth. At the entrance to that cave, plant Stonemaul banner and issue Brogg 's challenge to Onyxia. Brogg and the Stonemaul will have their lands back! "
679,The Theramore Docks,Bring the Captain's Documents to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village. ,"<name>, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks.  They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea. One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize.  He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you. The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks.  Find those documents, <name>, and bring them to me. "
680,Survey Alcaz Island,Speak to Cassa Crimsonwing and use one of her gryphons to survey Alcaz Island. ,"It looks like Renn's hunch about Alcaz Island was right. We need to survey that island, but it would take a whole brigade of troops to fight our way in there. Theramore's defenses can't weather such a hit, so I've arranged with Cassa Crimsonwing, the apprentice to Theramore's gryphon master, to allow you to use one of her beasts to survey Alcaz from the air. Alcaz Island holds the key to the mystery of the Defias' involvement in this kidnapping. "
681,Twilight of the Dawn Runner,Balandar Brightstar in Brackenwall Village wants you to reclaim the Dawn Runner Cargo and rescue his first mate Ithania from forces of Theramore at North Point Tower. ,"The ogres here are useful for little more than crude jokes, sour ale, and bouts of headbutting. When my ship, the Dawn Runner, ran aground, those curs from Theramore made off with my cargo and last surviving crewman. I made my way here searching for help, but those good-for-nothing ogres stared blankly at me when I told them my story. I could use the help of a reliable <race> in recovering what remains of my cargo and freeing Ithania from North Point Tower, to the northeast, where they're being held. "
682,Jarl Needs a Blade,Obtain Razorspine's Sword. ,"I have cutting to do.  I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but. . . I need myself a blade.  A certain blade. . . Some people call it a sword.  I call it a swing blade. You help me?  Those fish-men, you know, murlocs or whatever they're called. . . . There's one they call Razorspine, carries a big sword, lives north of here near the beach. That's the sword I need! But don't sleep on this.  What I'm cutting won't keep forever. . . "
683,Prisoners of the Grimtotems,Collect Grimtotem Keys from the Grimtotem Tauren in Blackhoof Village and use them to free 5 Theramore Prisoners. ,"We're doing all we can to keep the Grimtotem raiders at bay, but they keep launching assaults on the tower. Even worse, they've managed to discover and capture the patrols the captain sends out to gather information and safeguard the road. I suspect the captives are being held in Blackhoof Village, to the northwest. Knowing the Grimtotems, the defenders of the village probably carry the keys to the prisoners' cages with them. I don't care what you have to do, <class>, just bring back my men alive. "
684,Marsh Frog Legs,Collect 10 Marsh Frog Legs from Giant Marsh Frogs. ,"I like cooking.  Good swamp cooking.  Fried green frog legs and the like. And I'm all out of legs. The manor is overrun with frogs, though. Giant marsh frogs. Think you could bring me some of those legs? Nothin' to it, really. Just bop 'em on the head and bring me the legs. Then I'll make a stew and stew it up and suck it down and give you some too. Do you like stew? "
685,Take Down Tethyr! ,Use the mortars to defeat Tethyr. ,"Sea monster or no, we're not going to risk the safety of our shipping. I've ordered our best marksmen to prepare for a confrontation with this Tethyr. The artillerymen have augmented the dock's defenses with three mortars. I'm going to order the lighthouse's lamp illuminated. If Tethyr does attack, it will be your job to operate the mortars and take down the beast before it can kill all of the marksmen. I wouldn't stand in one place too long, though. Using the mortars is likely to draw its attention. "
686,Identifying the Brood,Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village would like you to bring him 7 Searing Tongues and 7 Searing Hearts. ,"Whilst that craven fool, Mok'Morokk, wallows in power and Tharg wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home. Why the puzzled stare, <name>? Expecting me to speak like an uncouth ruffian merely because I am an ogre? Now back to business, bring to me the hearts and tongues from the whelps and hatchlings. I shall trace the root of this evil. . . "
687,Banner of the Stonemaul,Retrieve the Stonemaul Banner from within the Den of Flame. ,"When the dragons came and took over Brogg 's old home, Stonemaul ogres fled and left everything behind, including clan's banner. Brogg knows banner was kept deep in Stonemaul ogre mound, but these days it's called Den of Flame. Brogg must have clan banner to get his revenge on dragons who killed his friends. Brogg 's clan's old mound, Den of Flame, is northwest of Mudsprocket and crawling with dragonkin. Banner will be deep inside the cave. Be careful, <name>. "
688,Justice Dispensed,Return to Krog at Brackenwall Village. ,"I doubt the Grimtotems will give up their campaign to drive humans from the marsh, though I get the impression you probably don't mind that. At least we have dealt with the perpetrators of the crimes at the Shady Rest Inn. Go tell your leader that his vengeance has been sated. "
689,A Shambling Threat,Slay 7 Withervine Creepers or Withervine Ragers in the marsh north of Brackenwall Village. ,"Dustwallow is Horde territory, <name>. The humans may have their little island and their precious sand bar, but the marsh belongs to us. In time, we will surely win this stalemate with the humans. For now, we must master our own territory. The withervine bog beasts to the north rise from the marsh itself to attack any living thing that approaches. If we own this marsh, we must not let our own land fight back against us! Slay the bog beasts, if you wish to serve the Horde. You will be rewarded. "
690,WANTED: Goreclaw the Ravenous,Kill Goreclaw the Ravenous and report to Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket. ,"Travelers and Steamwheedle personnel working in the field are advised to avoid the Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town. The area is overrun with raptors lead by the cruel and cunning Goreclaw the Ravenous, who has already killed at least two Steamwheedle engineers. Drazzit Dripvalve has authorized a generous reward to be paid to the individual who rids Mudsprocket of this menace. "
691,Hungry as an Ogre! ,Collect 8 Mirefin Heads from Mirefin Murlocs. ,"You meet some people out here sometime. Nice people. Met an ogre once. Ogres get hungry just like me. I'll never forget what he said. He said ""Mud big ogre. Me hungry. Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you. ""So I got him those fish and he ate 'em up. That's when I started too. The heads are the best part, all soggy-like. Don't crush those heads now. It makes them sad. Sad heads aren't good eating. Get me happy heads and I'll eat them and be happy too. "
692,Overlord Mok'Morokk's Concern,"Collect Overlord Mok'Morokk's grog, snuff and strongbox from Dustwallow Marsh. ","Bow before Overlord Mok'Morokk! Rexxar make me mighty leader of Stonemaul Clan! Me good leader. Me keep clan safe. Big dragons come and make fire at old home. Me smart ogre. Find new home for clan here. Leave old home so fast, me forget stuff. Tiny <race>, go get my things. Go south and find my yummy grog, my snuff and my strongbox. Me like you after you do that. You look in Den of Flame and Stonemaul Ruins. . . they be there, me sure! "
693,SMASH BROODQUEEN,Obtain the Broodqueen Pedipalp. ,"<The following is written in very large print. >SPIDERS IN NORTH CAVE BAD. POISON OGRES. OGRES GET SICK. BAD! BIG BIG SPIDER IN CAVE MAKE MORE SPIDERS. MORE SPIDERS BAD! KILL BIG SPIDER, STOP MORE SPIDERS. KILL BIG SPIDER, GET BIG PRIZE! GOOD! <A crude drawing accompanies this. >"
694,Captain Vimes,Bring the Spy's Report to Captain Garran Vimes. ,"Captain Vimes should see the orc report you found, <name>.  He knows the orcish language better than most.  And he should know that there are Horde spies near Theramore! The captain is in the barracks, on the northeastern side of Theramore Isle. "
695,Warchief's Command: Dustwallow Marsh! ,Report to Krog at Brackenwall Village in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Krog at Brackenwall Village. The marsh is overrun with enemies of many kinds and the Alliance forces there are dangerously strong. You can travel to Dustwallow Marsh by following the path from the eastern part of the Southern Barrens toward Brackenwall Village. Or, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! "
696,Return to Jaina,Return to Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore. ,"We must make plans to destroy the remnants of the Defias. Please convey my thanks to Lady Jaina, back in Theramore. She has ever been a loyal friend and steadfast ally. Go to the Mage Quarter at the western end of the city and speak with Archmage Malin at the foot of the tower there. He will speed your return to Theramore. "
697,Peace at Last,Captain Garran Vimes at Foothold Citadel wants you to lay the Wreath at the Hyal Family Monument. ,"I wish we had a way of letting James Hyal's wife and son know that we have brought their murderers to justice. <Captain Vimes produces a small wreath decorated with flowers. >There are some who say that their spirits will know, even if we cannot reach them. It's not much, but I'd like you to lay this wreath at the Hyal family monument. It's one of the stones in the graveyard just north of Theramore's gates. "
698,Traitors Among Us,Confront 5 Deserter Agitators in Theramore. ,"It's good to meet you, <class>. I've come to Theramore to help eliminate the problem of the deserters. Not only have some of the men abandoned their posts, but some have filtered back into the town. These deserter agents are spreading lies and propaganda, hoping to convince others to join their ranks. They're at virtually every guard post throughout the town and the docks. Find them, expose them, and discredit them. At this point, anything more risks inspiring more sympathy for them. "
699,Secondhand Diving Gear,Bring the Tool Kit and Damaged Diving Gear to Renn McGill in the Dustwallow Marsh. ,"There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative ""borrowing"" first. Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time! "
700,Proof of Treachery,Speak with Jaina to travel to Stormwind and meet with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth. ,"Although Onyxia has been exposed and removed from the court, the Defias who carried out her plan must be punished. Carry word to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth in Stormwind castle that the Defias are the ones who carried out the Varian's kidnapping. I have little doubt that Stormwind's armies will mete out swift and terrible justice to those involved. I can use my magic to expedite your trip to Stormwind. Just speak to me when you're prepared to go, <name>. "
701,Delivery for Drazzit,Take the Zeppelin Cargo to Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket. ,"Drazzit will expect to hear something from me soon, but I don't think the site is secure enough for me to leave. If you have time, would you be willing to take some of the salvaged cargo down to him at Mudsprocket? If you haven't been there yet, it's a small settlement to the southwest of here, beyond the Stonemaul Ruins. You can take the road there from Tabetha's Farm, too. When you get to Mudsprocket, the guy you're looking for is Drazzit Dripvalve. "
702,The End of the Deserters,Defeat Gavis Greyshield aboard the ship southeast of Theramore. ,"Now that we've eliminated the deserters from Theramore, it's time to complete this operation. My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks. Arresting their leader, Gavis Greyshield, should cause the others to lose their will to fight. Find him within the ship and convince him to surrender. I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up a bit of a fight for show, but then surrenders when he understands he can't win. "
703,Unleash the Raptors,Place the Raptor Bait near the windmill in Blackhoof Village. ,"Now that we've got our raptors, our next move is to ""encourage"" them to attack the Grimtotems at Blackhoof Village to the northwest. I've got a leftover haunch of. . . well, it doesn't really matter what it is. It'll be your bait. Set it down on the ground in Blackhoof Village near the windmill in the center of the settlement. The raptors should take care of the rest, if their training took. "
704,This Old Lighthouse,Speak to Babs Fizzletorque at the lighthouse on the island east of Theramore. ,"The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten it into her head to get it working again. I don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know? "
705,Inspecting the Ruins,Investigate the Shady Rest Inn in at the border of the Barrens in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"If you follow the road south from the village, and then west toward the Barrens, you'll come across the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. Theramore has sent an investigator to discover how the inn met its fate. I had a man placed in that inn as a spy and I don't trust in the competence of these humans to uncover what happened. Whatever you find, don't give a scrap of it to that investigator. We'll handle this ourselves. "
706,Inspecting the Ruins,Speak to Inspector Tarem at the Shady Rest Inn. ,"Poor James never recovered from the destruction of the Shady Rest and the murder of his family. The boys and I are doing what we can to find the monsters who did this. I've sent our best investigator, Inspector Tarem, out to the ruins, but this is too big a job for any one man. If you'd lend Tarem a hand, we'd appreciate it. Light knows, we'd all like to be out there helping. The main road will lead you to the inn, but take care. Your journey will take you beyond the protection of my soldiers. "
707,The Brood of Onyxia,Destroy 5 Eggs of Onyxia. ,"Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the Dragonmurk. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch. Make haste to Wyrmbog in the south of Dustwallow Marsh. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them. We will never reclaim Stonemaul Village if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground. As for Mok'Morokk. . . I have other plans for the sod. "
708,Jaina Must Know,Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore. ,"You must bring news of our findings to Lady Jaina without delay! If the Defias were transporting a prisoner, there's no telling who it might be or if the person is still alive! One thing is for certain, <name>. The Defias wouldn't go to all this trouble for some petty grudge. Their prisoner must have been someone of importance. Lady Jaina would know better than anyone else what these findings mean. You'll find her at the top of the mage tower at Theramore's center. "
709,Spirits of Stonemaul Hold,Put 10 Stonemaul Spirits to rest at the Stonemaul Ruins. ,"Brogg has completed the totem that will put the spirits of his friends to rest. When the dragonkin came, they killed all Stonemaul who did not flee. Brogg fled with Overlord Mok'Morokk, hoping to lead a counterattack with other Stonemaul survivors. The counterattack never came and the spirits of the Stonemaul dead still haunt Brogg and the others. Take this totem north to Stonemaul Ruins and use it near ogre skeletons to draw the spirit to you. Defeat the spirit to give it rest with its bones. "
710,The Black Shield,Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Mosarn in Thunder Bluff. ,"Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before. In thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work. Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted. It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have. "
711,Confirming the Suspicion,Collect 4 Grimtotem Notes from Grimtotem Elders and combine them into the Grimtotem Battle Plan. ,"The Grimtotems may be the most warlike of all the tauren clans, but they're by no means unorganized. If they're the ones who put the torch to the Shady Rest Inn, they'll have had orders from one of their clan elders. There's a large Grimtotem settlement called Blackhoof Village to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek. "
712,Cleansing Witch Hill,Plant the Witchbane Torch at the end of the dock and defeat the evil haunting Witch Hill. ,"The torch is ready. Plant it at the end of the dock and be prepared to face whatever comes forth. I have no idea what the torch's smoke may reveal. . . if anything emerges at all. I must say, I have my doubts about this kind of folk magic, but we haven't time for anything else. For your sake and Jarl's, I wish you luck. "
713,Defias in Dustwallow? ,Obtain the Defias Orders from Garn Mathers. ,"My scouts have reported a shipwreck just off the beach to the northeast. Shipwrecks aren't all that unusual out here, but the reports also indicated the survivors were all wearing red bandanas. . . the symbol of the Defias! The reports indicate their leader resides on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession. "
714,Catch a Dragon by the Tail,Collect 8 Wyrmtail stalks in the Dragonmurk or Wyrmbog. ,"With the zeppelin crash delaying supplies, we've run out of medicines and bandages. We're making use of what we can, but between all the insects, the injuries, and the enemies we're encountering here, I can barely keep up! I've found one herb that seems to help heal wounds and dull pain, but it, too, is in short supply. It's called wyrmtail, and it's abundant in the Dragonmurk and Wyrmbog areas east of town. The plants themselves are made of coiled stalks, and seem to pulsate when you look at them. "
715,Questioning Reethe,Go with Ogron to speak with Reethe. ,"It took a long time, but I found Reethe. He hide good for a human. Ogron worried that he might be crazy after so much time in swamp. You come with me for we go get answers from him. "
716,A Grim Connection,Report to Captain Darill at North Point. ,"I've spoken with Inspector Tarem regarding the evidence you gathered from the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. He seems certain that the hoofprints and the shield you found there point to the Grimtotem clan of tauren. With reports of Grimtotem activity on the rise in the marsh, this has to be more than a mere coincidence. I'm sending you to speak with Captain Darill, who is something of an expert on the Grimtotems. Follow the road north out of town to North Point tower. It's the second outpost on the road. "
717,Flight to Theramore,Speak with Bragok in Ratchet to fly to Theramore. ,"Listen, I got no special love for the Alliance. . . but then again, I got no real hate for you guys either. Your gold is as good as anyone else's.  Sometimes better. Jeyne left some gold for your travel costs.  I believe the person you're looking for in Dustwallow goes by the name of Calia Hastings.  And the best way to get there is to talk to our flight master, Bragok.  He'll fly you there, if you want.  The flight's free, thanks to your friend. "
718,Is it Real? ,Talk to Nat Pagle at Nat's Landing in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"Oh, I'm sure you and Babs had a good laugh over the outlandish descriptions and sketches in the book, but have you stopped to consider there might be some truth to the legends? If you listen closely enough, I bet you can still hear sailors talk about Tethyr, the sea creature the book says lives right here! Of course, if you wanted to know for sure, you could always ask old Nat Pagle. He's got a small fishing camp on a little island in Tidefury Cove, which is southwest across Dustwallow Bay. "
719,Challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk,Defeat Mok'Morokk and report the news to Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village. ,You dare challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk? Haw! Me crush tiny <race>! You tell me when ready for good beating. 
720,The Call of Kalimdor,"Ride the ship from Booty Bay to Ratchet, then speak with Gazlowe. ","Say, you haven't seen a fish about this long?  Short fins?  Responds to the name Steve?  He's blue? Never mind, I'll keep looking. Actually. . . there was another reason I came here to Booty Bay.  Boss Krog, over in Dustwallow, is looking for new blood.  Someone to help us Stonemaul from getting overrun.  You look strong enough. Wait on the edge of the pier for the next ship, then ride to Ratchet. Gazlowe should be able to help you from there. Steve?  Steve! "
721,Seek Out Tabetha,Speak with Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire. ,"The arms you captured in Blackhoof Village have not seen any combat beyond mere training exercises, which means the Grimtotems who destroyed the Shady Rest are still at large. To the south, in the heart of the Quagmire, lives the witch Tabetha. Though she is a human, she has dealt honorably with us and trained some of our mages. Ask her for assistance in tracking down the band of Grimtotem responsible for burning the inn. The Alliance must not be allowed to think we were complicit in the attack. "
722,Raptor Captor,Use the Sturdy Rope to capture 6 Bloodfen Raptors or Bloodfen Screechers. ,"The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our Grimtotem neighbors. Take this rope and use it to capture Bloodfen raptors or Bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle. "
723,"Oh, It's Real",Speak with Major Mills at the docks in Theramore. ,"Yes, Tethyr is certainly real, and he lives in the waters off Theramore. Has a thing for bright lights. He's the reason they shut down the lighthouse in the first place, you know. . . And if you light it up again, he'll come right back. But no one in their right mind would do that. So that must be your plan! It's been good sharing a drink with you, but don't blame ol' Nat if Tethyr REALLY turns you into fish bait. If you're going to do this, make sure you consult Major Mills at the Theramore docks. "
724,The Black Shield,Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Do'gol in Brackenwall Village. ,"Hmm. . . I don't see anything out of the ordinary with this shield. We should have Do'gol, the blacksmith, take a look at it, and see if he can tell us more about it, but I wouldn't hold out hope. . . "
725,Lieutenant Paval Reethe,Bring Reethe's Badge to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing away debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore. Underneath the anchor is embossed the name ""Lieutenant Paval Reethe"". "
726,The Essence of Enmity,Bring 10 Black Dragonkin Essences to Brogg at Mudsprocket. ,"To make the totem Brogg will need for his ritual, he must use the essences of the creatures who killed his friends. The hate and anger of Brogg 's enemies will fuel the magic of his vengeance. Track down Firemane ash tails, scouts, or scalebanes and use Brogg's totem on their corpses. Only when the dragonkin die will they give up their essences. The creatures you seek swarm over the Den of Flame to the northwest and the Stonemaul Ruins to the north. "
727,The Black Shield,Collect 5 Acidic Venom Sacs from Darkmist spiders. ,"Hmmm, there's writing right here on the rim of the shield, but it's hard to read from all the burned stuff. I need acid to make it clear. Venom from the darkmist spiders would do good. The spiders have taken over an old mine, the Darkmist Cavern, northwest of the village. Get me some of their sacs and I can clean this up. "
728,Bloodfen Feathers,Collect 5 Bloodfen Feathers from Bloodfen Raptors. ,"Are you startled by Brogg 's presence here, little <race>? Don't worry. Goblins at Mudsprocket are Brogg 's friends and you can be, too. Brogg left Brackenwall Village when new overlord not take revenge against black dragonkin for destroying old home and killing many of Brogg 's old friends. Brogg come here to lay friends spirits to rest and avenge them, but Brogg need help preparing. For ritual, Brogg need feathers with strong magic, like ones worn by raptors at Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town. "
729,Tabetha's Assistance,Speak with Tabetha at her farm. ,"I can't spare any men to help search for a second Grimtotem outpost, but I think I know of someone who might be able to help you. Deep in the Quagmire, to the south, there is a small farmstead owned by Tabetha. She may seem little more than an old hermit, but the truth is that she's a mage and scryer of some renown. Follow the road south to her farm and seek her help in finding the culprits responsible for the massacre at the Shady Rest Inn. "
730,The Lost Report,Bring the Spy's Report to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village. ,"Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment. The parchment is a report made by an orc who spent weeks spying on the city of Theramore. After scanning the parchment, it is clear that it must be brought to the orc spymaster in Brackenwall Village. "
731,The Black Shield,Speak with Krog in Brackenwall Village. ,"Oh, I think I might have dropped too much acid onto the shield. Let me just rub a little. . . Hm, kind of hard to read, but it looks like the name Mosarn. Never heard of him. Maybe Krog knows. Krog knows many people. "
732,Theramore Spies,"Kill 9 Theramore Infiltrators, then return to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village. ","The Horde and Alliance hold an uneasy truce.  Outlying skirmishes and covert actions are taken by one side against the other, and it is our duty to ensure the Horde is on top! Now is the chance to do just that. Alliance infiltrators have taken positions east of Brackenwall Village.  They spy on the village and report our movements to Theramore, which we cannot allow. Hunt down the infiltrators and slay them.  Send a clear message to their superiors that we will not tolerate their spies' presence! "
733,Flight to Brackenwall,Speak with Bragok in Ratchet to fly to Brackenwall Village. ,"Listen, I got no special love for the Horde. . . but then again, I got no real hate for you guys either. Your gold is as good as anyone else's. That two-headed ogre and his pet fish left some gold for your travel costs.  I believe the person you're looking for in Dustwallow goes by the name of Krog.  And the best way to get there is to talk to our flight master, Bragok.  He'll fly you there, if you want.  The flight's free, thanks to your friend. "
734,Suspicious Hoofprints,Report about the suspicious prints at the Shady Rest Inn to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh. "
735,Justice for the Hyals,Speak to Captain Garran Vimes at Foothold Citadel in Theramore. ,"Although these Grimtotems were simply a nuisance to me, Captain Vimes will want to know of your deeds. Bring him the news that you have tracked down and dealt with those responsible for the burning of the Shady Rest Inn. It's too late to save Jim Hyal's family, but perhaps the Grimtotems will think twice before attacking anyone connected to Theramore. "
736,Mission to Mudsprocket,Speak with Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket. ,"The Steamwheedle Cartel has recently established a new outpost in the southern part of Dustwallow Marsh. It's called Mudsprocket, if I recall, and it's located on the main road south out of Tabetha's Farm and the Stonemaul Ruins. This is an excellent opportunity for us to establish new trade contacts and Lady Jaina wants me to send a representative down there to establish contact. Would you be willing to go? "
737,. . . and Bugs,Bring 12 Pristine Crawler Legs to Morgan Stern in Theramore. ,"Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab.  And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- spiny rock crawlers they call them -- will be perfect! The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs.  An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish. Head on over to the rocks surrounding Theramore and get me those legs! "
738,The Deserters,Get information about Reethe from Balos Jacken and the deserters in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"It has been a struggle maintaining a presence in the marsh, but through strength of our resolve, we have been able to maintain several defensive watchtowers throughout the area. The latest information and scouting reports I have received indicate that a group of deserters has squatted in our abandoned tower at Lost Point, southeast of the inn. The local lieutenant seems to be Balos Jacken. See if you can get some information out of him. Be warned, <name>. He may be a tough nut to crack. "
739,Hero's Call: Dustwallow Marsh! ,Report to Calia Hastings at Theramore Isle in Dustwallow Marsh. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Calia Hastings at Theramore Isle. You must aid SI: 7's Calia Hastings in uncovering the threats to Theramore, both within the city and beyond its walls. You can reach Theramore Isle by taking the boat from Menethil or traveling across the marsh from the Southern Barrens. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
740,Propaganda War,Obtain the Deserter Propaganda from the boat at the end of the Theramore docks. ,"The deserter agents were doing far more than just chatting up the guards. We've found a number of leaflets the deserters somehow managed to smuggle in on a ship in the docks. The ship used to transport the leaflets is still in Theramore, at the farthest dock. If you can sneak aboard and capture the rest of their propaganda documents, their agents will lose their most powerful tool. Be careful! The ship is manned by seasoned privateers and the cargo is probably being kept in the captain's quarters. "
741,Stinky's Escape,"Escort ""Stinky"" Ignatz, then speak with Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet. ","Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me! ! I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>. A goblin from Ratchet named Mebok Mizzyrix needs some bogbean leaves for a potion, or something. . . I honestly don't care why -- his money was good and I know this swamp, so here I am. Too bad I got myself surrounded before I found the bogbean!  Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for Mebok's plant? "
742,More than Coincidence,Collect 7 Blackhoof Armaments from Blackhoof Village. ,"We've gleaned as much as we can from the ruins of the inn. I'm concerned about where the investigation will lead us from here, but we must know the truth. Between the hoofprints and the shield with Mosarn's mark, I'm led to believe that the Grimtotems may have been involved. They've recently established a settlement in the swamp, Blackhoof Village to the northeast. Travel to Blackhoof Village and search for more arms of Mosarn's manufacture. "
743,Jarl Needs Eyes,Collect 20 Unpopped Darkmist Eyes from Darkmist spiders. ,"Eye juice is good juice for drinking.  Too bad most critters only have two eyes. But spiders have lots of eyes.  Lots and lots.  And Darkmist eye juice is tasty.  Smooth and salty!  Unpopped spider eyes. . . I taste them already. Darkmist spiders are west of here, in the Darkmist Cavern.  You figure the spiders are named after the cave. . . or is it the other way around? "
744,They Call Him Smiling Jim,Speak with Captain Garran Vimes on the top floor of Foothold Citadel. ,"I can't help it if I feel sorry for ol' Jim there. He wasn't always like that. Ran an inn out in the marsh for a while, wonderful place. Look, I don't really want to talk about it. Bring it up with Captain Vimes if you really have to. He's stationed on the top floor of Foothold Citadel, the large barracks to the east of Lady Jaina's tower. "
745,Raze Direhorn Post! ,"Use Tabetha's Torch to burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post. ","There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new ""neighbors"" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer. Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm, near the road. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor. "
746,Discrediting the Deserters,Distribute the Altered Leaflets to 6 Theramore Guards. ,"I've altered the leaflets you captured from the deserters' mercenary friends at the docks. Now, anyone who reads them will get an entirely different view of the deserters and their aims. If we distribute these to enough of the guards, the deserters will be too embarrassed to ever reestablish their presence within our walls. <Calia hands you a stack of the altered leaflets. >Why don't you get started while I plan our next move? "
747,Suspicious Hoofprints,Report about the suspicious prints at the Shady Rest Inn to Krog in Brackenwall Village. ,"Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh. "
748,Return to Krog,Speak with Krog at Brackenwall Village. ,"I hope I've been helpful to you and I'm sorry I can't offer more information. My apprentices and I produce such a large volume of arms and armor that it's almost impossible to recall details about any individual piece. Not only do we outfit the braves defending tauren lands, but the Grimtotems have a particular fondness for my work. A seasoned warrior knows good work when he sees it. "
749,Arms of the Grimtotems,Captain Darill at North Point Tower wants you to bring him 7 Blackhoof Armaments. ,"If the equipment you found at the ruins of the inn belonged to a Grimtotem attack party, there's likely to be more just like it within their camp to the northwest. We haven't been able to gather much information about Blackhoof Village, but judging from the size of the raiding parties, there's a substantial force based there. Do whatever you have to to capture some of their equipment so that we can compare it with your findings from the inn. "
750,Darkmist Extermination,Destroy 8 Darkmist Eggs in Darkmist Cavern. ,"The spiders that occupy Darkmist Cavern to the northwest are another vicious threat to us here. They are nothing the ogres cannot handle, but splitting our attention to them when Theramore's forces lurk nearby is a deadly mistake. I need someone to destroy the eggs inside Darkmist Cavern, to cut off this infestation. You will find the eggs in the deepest part of the webbed mines. . . along with their guardians. "
751,The Black Shield,Bring the Blackened Iron Shield to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn. The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney. "
752,The Witch's Bane,Collect 9 sprigs of Witchbane near Witch Hill. ,"In my years as an herbalist, I've often observed that nature will provide subtle cures to the most vexing of problems. I've read that hedge mages and witch doctors often use the smoke of an herb known as witchbane to draw evil from its hiding places. If true, this would mean witchbane should be growing near the shallow waters of Witch Hill. You should be able to identify it by its broad leaves and reddish central stalk. Bring me any of the herb you can find, <name>. It may be our only hope. "
753,The Black Shield,Speak with Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"Ah, I almost missed this. . . The leather strap on the back must have burned off, but it seems like it was made to fit a large person. I'd guess a tauren, actually. That's about all I can tell you. Tell Captain Vimes I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. "
754,The Brood of Onyxia,Speak with Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village. ,You leave me alone now. Go tell Draz'Zilb we stay here. No black dragon here. 
755,What's Haunting Witch Hill? ,Gather information by defeating 10 Risen Husks or Risen Spirits. ,"I traveled out here to pay Jarl a visit at his new home and it's been a nonstop horror show ever since! There's something seriously wrong here and I can't be the only one who sees it. . . Have you seen the ghosts and corpses shambling about Witch Hill? I've a feeling that if anyone knows what happened here, it is them. Seek out these risen husks and risen spirits in the surrounding area, grant them rest through combat, and see what you can learn from them before this evil consumes Jarl! "
756,Dastardly Denizens of the Deep,"Bring Dastardly Denizens of the Deep to ""Dirty"" Michael Crowe on the Theramore docks. ","You know, it's amazing what you can find in that old lighthouse. After I lit the lamp, I noticed this book in one of the old trunks up there. <Babs holds up the book and reads the title dramatically. >"" Dastardly Denizens of the Deep! ""Why, I think I might swoon if I ever saw one of these! I'm sure it's good for a laugh or two, but I simply don't have time for reading right now. You know who might enjoy it, though. . . that fishmonger on the docks, ""Dirty"" Michael Crowe. He collects old books. "
757,Talk to Ogron,Find Ogron to the southeast of Brackenwall Village. ,"I know this human, Paval Reethe. Pathetic, even for his kind. He deserted his fellow soldiers and is now hiding out in the woods. I sent Ogron out to track him down. Some of the others suspect he's been stealing from our supplies. I think I saw Ogron heading off to the southeast. "
758,The Zeppelin Crash,Speak with Moxie Steelgrille at Beezil's Wreck. ,"Not long ago, a goblin zeppelin crashed to the east. A representative of the Steamwheedle Cartel passed through here a few days ago. She was looking for information about the zeppelin's cargo and its pilot, Beezil, but none of us really got a good look at the crash. I doubt she'll be able to clean up after the wreck by herself, much less recover whatever cargo the vessel might have carried. If you have time, you may want to check up on her out at Beezil's Wreck, due east of here, near the mountains. "
759,Feast at the Blue Recluse,"My nephew said you aided him with his research in Dustwallow, and that you helped his associate out of a tight spot. ","My nephew said you aided him with his research in Dustwallow, and that you helped his associate out of a tight spot.  Well, we Sterns stick together and we don't ignore our friends! So wash your hands, <name>, because we're about to throw a party in your honor! "
760,The Black Shield,Bring the Blackened Iron Shield to Krog in Brackenwall Village. ,"An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn. The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney. "
761,The Deserters,Speak with Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore about Reethe. ,"Reethe? That coward? We threw him out of camp because he insisted on raiding the supplies of the ogres up at Brackenwall Village. We're not so many in number that we could stand up to those mindless brutes. He crossed the line one too many times, so we left him to fend for himself. Now, I helped you out. . . So, why don't you help us out and forget you bumped into us? "
762,Thresher Oil,Collect 4 containers of Thresher Oil from Murk Threshers beneath the Theramore docks. ,"The old log in the lighthouse indicates that the lamp was fueled with oil from the threshers that live along the coast here. <Babs wrinkles her nose at the mention of such outdated technology. >I suppose it's a practical, if inelegant solution. The log says that the oil taken from the youngest murk threshers works the best, and those live right underneath the docks of Theramore. If you're up for it, would you help resupply the lighthouse with fuel? "
763,Raze Direhorn Post! ,"Use Tabetha's Torch to burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post. ","There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new ""neighbors"" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer. Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm, near the road. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor. "
764,Mudrock Soup and Bugs,Bring 8 Forked Mudrock Tongues to Morgan Stern in Theramore. ,"I'm working on a dish I call ""Mudrock Soup and Bugs. ""  I still need the major ingredients, and. . . well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through Dustwallow Marsh! So, <name>, can you do some hunting for me?  First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles.  You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay. But I don't want just any tongues!  I hear that the tongues of some Mudrocks are forked. . . They say the forked tongues have a distinct flavor, and I want that flavor in my dish. . . "
765,Lieutenant Paval Reethe,Bring Reethe's Badge to Krog in Brackenwall Village. ,"A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white, enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore. Underneath the anchor is embossed the name ""Lieutenant Paval Reethe"". "
766,A Disturbing Development,Report to Captain Wymor at Sentry Point. ,"Reports from our scout patrols have recently taken a disturbing turn. They tell of men wearing red Defias bandanas walking the Dreadmurk Shore north of Theramore's walls. Wreckage in the area suggests they may be survivors of a shipwreck, but our information is limited. Captain Wymor at Sentry Point, a guard tower to the north of the city, is looking for help in following up on the reports. "
767,Lieutenant Paval Reethe,Find out more about Reethe from Adjutant Tesoran in Theramore. ,"I don't recognize the name of Lieutenant Paval Reethe. Your best bet would be to check with Adjutant Tesoran. He keeps track of all the records for the Theramore guard, from personnel to their equipment. He should be able to tell you who this Reethe is with a quick check of his books. "
768,The Brood of Onyxia,Speak with Overlord Mok'Morokk in Brackenwall Village. ,"Stonemaul Village was invaded by the brood of Onyxia. But why would the daughter of the black dragonlord, Deathwing, descend upon our lands? This is most troubling. Surely, Onyxia was driven here for a purpose beyond laying siege to a small band of ogres. Notify Mok'Morokk at once! Action must be taken. "
769,Stinky's Escape,"Escort ""Stinky"" Ignatz, then speak with Morgan Stern in Theramore. ","Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me! I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>. The cook Morgan Stern is researching a new recipe, and he sent me out here to gather bogbean leaves.  I guess he thinks they're tasty. Anyway, while looking for a bogbean plant. . . I got myself surrounded!  Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for the bogbean? "
770,The Orc Report,Bring the Spy's Report to Lieutenant Aden in Theramore. ,"Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment. The parchment is written in orcish. . . and it looks important. "
771,Daelin's Men,Return the information about Reethe to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore. ,"Reddon. . . Redpath. . . Ah, here it is! Lieutenant Paval Reethe. Joined the Theramore guard along with most of the recruits that came across the sea with Lady Proudmoore. Enlisted with the marines of Kul Tiras at the age of sixteen. Distinguished service, promotions. . . Listed as missing. "
772,The Arts of a Mage,Reach level 3 to learn Frost Nova. ,"As ya' develop ya' powah, ya' gonna start to tink of new spells, new ways to use ya' arcane talents. 

Go now, grow ya' skills, and 'den come back an' show me what 'cha figure out. "
774,Touch the Untouchable,"Use the Phaseblood Potion at the Sigil of Tichondrius to shift into the nether, and search for the Claw of Tichondrius. ","I've added a drop of my very own essence to the ooze. Look for a glowing sigil to the west, at the edge of Shadowlurk Ridge. Stand on it, concentrate, and pour this stuff all over yourself. It should be enough to shift you into the nether and let you see what's REALLY there. You won't be alone. . . the satyr's treasure is being guarded by the biggest voidstalker they could summon. Defeat him, and the treasure is yours. And come back in one piece, or this crazy broad's gonna fry me! "
775,A Flare Fight,Use Darla's Box of Megaflares to reveal 8 Talonbranch Prowlers and slay them. ,"This operation's stayed pretty discreet so far, but the worgen over in Talonbranch Glade have it out for us. They've been trying everything they can to get us shut down. Some of the workers have told me they've seen glimpses of worgen lurking around the clearing. Take these oversized megaflares. They're bright enough to show anything that gets anywhere near them. Use the flares to look for prowling worgen, and make sure they don't leave here alive! "
776,Burnout,Use the Stolen Irontree Explosives to ignite 7 Oil Geysers in Irontree Clearing. ,"Your pump sabotage has caused pipes to break all over camp. The goblins are in a panic over the geysers, and it's about to get worse. Take the gathered explosives and use them to set the geysers aflame. We're going to do as much damage to the camp as we can, and keep that oil from being used to fuel shredders. . . or worse, Horde warships. "
777,Borrowed Bombs,Collect 8 Irontree Explosives from Irontree Cavern. ,"The workers in Irontree Cavern below us have been driven out already. Something else has overtaken the cave. This works in our favor. I spotted at least a few of them dropping explosives as they fled. . . explosives we'll need for the next part of our plan. Enter the cave and salvage any abandoned bombs you can find. When you're finished with that and the pump, we'll begin our final assault. "
778,Dance for Ruumbo! ,Do a silly dance for Ruumbo. ,"You have done well, <race>! Ruumbo is pleased by your bravery, and the delicious honey you have given Ruumbo. Now, you must. . . you must dance! Yes! Dance for Ruumbo! Dance! "
779,Do the Imp-Possible,Weaken Impsy and use the Enchanted Imp Sack to capture him. ,"The satyr hide their corrupted moonwell behind an impenetrable barrier of demonic fire. Their forces must have some way of getting through it. Interrogating the satyr will be useless, but the imps they consort with will be easily swayed. I have a specific one in mind, as well. . . In the foothills to the east, a lone imp has been seen wandering, far from the other demons. He should prove easy pickings. Weaken him with combat, and then use this enchanted sack to capture him. Then I'll do the talking. . . "
780,Culling the Corrupted,Collect 10 Corrupted Pelts from Angerclaw Bears or Felpaw Wolves. ,"The sickening corruption of demons pervades this entire forest. The soil, the trees, the animals. . . all grow thick with fel magics. We of the Emerald Circle have sworn to cleanse this forest, and doing so requires a constant battle. While some life here can still be healed, the bears and wolves that wander nearby have been twisted too far. We must end their suffering, and ensure their bodies do not spread the taint further. Hunt the bears and wolves, and return to me with their hides. "
781,The Fall of Tichondrius,Relive Illidan's battle with Tichondrius. ,"Yes, Illidan took the power of the Skull of Gul'dan for himself. But did he flee with it into the night? Did he use it for his own glory? No. . . his very first action was to use his new power to assault the dreadlord Tichondrius! Witness his triumph, <class>. Witness how Illidan reclaimed Felwood from the demons. . . and the thanks he was given. "
782,Nature and Nurture,Fill the vial at the moonwell in Whisperwind Grove and pour it on the ground between the dead ancient protectors in Irontree Woods. ,"The ancient protectors of Irontree Woods to the north have been dead for years, their bodies a grim symbol of the damage to these lands. Every season, we take the water from this moonwell, and pour it on the ground before them, hoping it will nurture new life. If you'd like, you can deliver the water yourself. It is an excellent opportunity for reflection. Take this vial and fill it at the moonwell, and pour it on the very top of the small hill between the three ancients. "
783,It's Time to Oil Up,Use Darla's Grapple to collect Irontree Oil Cans and use them to oil 7 Irontree Shredders. ,"Three things come out of Irontree Clearing: lumber, oil, and exhausted workers. The first two are pretty much the cause of the third, but I like to be efficient about things where I can. I've got our shredders working triple unpaid overtime, and there's really nowhere in the schedule for them to get maintenance. Use this grappling hook to nab some of the extra oil cans floating around camp and use them to oil up the shredders, would you? "
784,Dousing the Flames of Protection,Use the Purified Moonwell Water to douse the four Braziers of Protection within Shadow Hold. ,"The braziers are spread throughout Shadow Hold. Enter the tunnel into Shadow Hold, and follow it through the underground passageways. Douse each of the brazier's flames and the protections the Council has set up will fall for at least a short period of time. "
785,Seeking Soil,Bring the Seedling Protector to 7 patches of Rich Soil. ,"<The tiny sproutling shuffles around, motioning you towards the south. You can barely hear a faint voice. >Soil. . . <It looks like it wants fresh soil. Maybe you should guide it to some of the richer-looking patches. >"
786,Feathers for Grazle,"While you have proven yourself to me, you may need to continue to work toward proving yourself to the suspicious brethren of my tribe. ","Well done, <name>!  I will make sure that your deeds are known amongst my kind. Remember to bring any of the feathers you find to me.  I will continue to accept them as long as necessary. "
787,Break the Unbreakable,Slay Xavathras. ,"With the claw, we are ready to break through the Jadefire's defenses. Head into the ruins to the northwest. Beyond the frontline of the satyr you'll find a narrow pass heading to their corrupted moonwell. An enormous wall of demonic flame bars the path, but the Claw of Tichondrius should be able to dispel it. Beyond the barrier you will find the leader of these forces, Xavathras, guarding the corrupted moonwell. Slay him once you are through! "
788,The Chieftain's Key,Retrieve Drizle's Key from Chieftain Bloodmaw. ,"Sniff. . . I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get caught! They grabbed me and put this chain on me and left me here! I can't move and my leg fell asleep and I'm hungry! The chief has the key. . . Chieftain Bloodmaw, the other ones said. He's in the north end of the camp. But hurry! Please! Don't leave me alone here! "
789,The Inner Circle,Slay 12 defenders inside Shadow Hold. ,"With their outer sentries gone, the greater members of the Shadow Council are next. Deep within the corrupted barrow dens you'll find powerful Jaedenar Warlocks, Hunters, Enforcers, Darkweavers, and Legionnaires. They must be defeated if these lands are to be saved! "
790,Hazzard Disposal,"Use Kitty's Eartag to get Winna Hazzard's attention, and then slay her. ","Winna's hooked tight into the source of the slime itself, at the very back of Bloodvenom Post to the west. She makes sure it keeps flowing, and it keeps her safe! But if you can get her attention. . . Take the eartag and show it to Winna. If there's even a little, tiny bit of her left, maybe it'll get through. Maybe her regret for her poor lost kitty will come to the surface and she'll feel sorry just one more time, and come out of the slime! And then maybe you can kill her and stop the slime. Yay! "
791,Ruumbo Demands Honey,Collect 10 Deadwood Honey Globs from the hives in Deadwood Village using Ruumbo's Honey Stick. ,"Ruumbo hungers! The Deadwood jerks have stolen all their honey from the Timbermaw tribe! We saw. . . er, Ruumbo saw them do it! Now Ruumbo must have that honey! Take this. . . this stick! Yes, this stick. Take this stick and use it to steal the honey from their beehives in Deadwood Village. Ruumbo must have as much honey as possible. This is vital. "
792,Twin Temptresses,Slay Moora and Salia. ,"Moora and Salia are the personal servants of Shadow Lord Fel'dan. Do not be deceived by them! These foul succubi use their wiles and foul magic to draw mortals deep into Shadow Hold. Those in their grasp undergo brainwashing, or are sacrificed by Fel'dan to his demonic masters. The two fight as one and are never found apart, making them a considerable threat. Proceed further into Shadow Hold and slay them. "
793,WANTED: The Demon Hunter,Slay Feronas Sindweller. ,"Since reclaiming Jadefire Run from the satyr, the Emerald Circle has sent many druids to begin the long task of cleansing the ruins. Last night, several of them were murdered. . . by a night elf. The witnesses say it was a demon hunter, a crazed disciple of Illidan. A rare sight. No doubt he's gone mad with power just like his master. I'll pay top bounty for proof of this murderer's death. He's been spotted just off the road to the north, in a valley beneath Jadefire Run. "
794,Feathers for Nafien,"While you have proven yourself to me, you may need to continue to work toward proving yourself to the suspicious brethren of my tribe. ","Well done, <name>!  I will make sure that your deeds are known amongst my kind. Remember to bring any of the feathers you find to me.  I will continue to accept them as long as necessary. "
795,A Destiny of Flame and Sorrow,Relive Illidan's battle with Arthas. ,"My kind has always been hated for what we do. . . despised outcasts, accused of corruption beyond redemption. Yet if it was not for a demon hunter, these very woods would be the greatest stronghold of the Burning Legion on Azeroth. I speak of my master, Illidan Stormrage, the ""Betrayer"". See for yourself. See what occured here when Illidan was first freed, and the demonic forces of the dreadlord Tichondrius ruled this forest completely unopposed. . . "
796,Stupid Drizle! ,Find Drizle in Felpaw Village. ,"Stupid, stupid Drizle! I told him not to go! Drizle wanted to steal more honey from Felpaw Village. . . you know, just west of here? You can see it from the cliff. . . Anyway. . . I told him it was a dumb idea but he went anyway, and then the Deadwood tribe got him, and. . . and. . . Sniff. . . I don't know what they're gonna do! Please find him, <Mr. /Ms. > <race>! Even if he is a dummy! I don't want Drizle to get eaten! "
797,Buzzers for Baby,Kill 10 Ironwood Buzzers to feed the Seedling Protector. ,"<The tiny seedling opens its leaves wide, like a baby bird waiting to be fed. It speaks in a very faint voice: >Hungry. . . want. . . bugs. . . <You can hear the buzzing of wasps to the south. Could they be what the little thing wants to feed on? >"
798,Disarming Bears,Collect 7 Deadwood Weapons from Felpaw Village. ,"I would prefer to do as much as we can to protect my people from the Deadwood tribe without slaughtering every last one of them. We've taken steps towards this before, and if you wish to prove yourself to the Timbermaw tribe, I would ask you do this as well. Look for the piles of weapons kept in Felpaw Village to the southwest. Take as many as you find. If we disarm the Deadwood tribe, we may be able to stop some bloodshed later. "
799,The Shredders of Irontree,Kill 9 Irontree Shredders. ,"Disgusting, isn't it? Look at them. Pathetic little things that can't even toil with their own bodies. They stomp around in their massive metal shredders, carving the forest to splinters. I bet they think they're safe in there, all warm and cozy. Prove them wrong. Blaze north through the camp and destroy as many shredders as you can. Once you've spilled some blood, we're going to take this place apart for good. "
800,Deceivers In Our Midst,Slay 12 Jadefire Shifters in Jadefire Run. ,"Now that you've had a lesson in keeping an open mind, perhaps you'd like to learn WHY I killed those druids. The answer is simple: They are not druids at all. Demons still roam the ruins, now hiding in plain sight in the guise of friendly caretakers. See for yourself. . . this blindfold is soaked in demon blood. Take it north up the hills to Jadefire Run and place it on your eyes. It will show even the most oblivious fool the true nature of any demon. "
801,Shadow Lord Fel'dan,Slay Shadow Lord Fel'dan. ,"Shadow Lord Fel'dan awaits further in the depths, <name>. His wrath will be unmatched now that you have slain his beloved pets. Even without Moora and Salia at his side, he is a terrible force to be reckoned with. Beware his dark powers; he is nearly more demon than orc by now. "
802,Salve via Hunting,Possessing a Cenarion Beacon allows one to sea a corrupted soul shard on those tainted beasts that are put down for the greater good. ,"Very well then, here are your Cenarion plant salves. Scour Felwood for corrupted plants, <name>! Wherever they are, use the salve I have given you to purify them. "
803,Timbermaw Hold,Speak with Nafien at Timbermaw Hold in Felwood. ,"Okay, I know this is a longshot, but I figure it never hurts to ask. While I deal with the fallout of all the ridiculous nonsense that just went on here, I need you to go speak to some bears. The Timbermaw furbolg control the forests to the northeast, and they're not too fond of us. I just need someone to give them the idea the Horde isn't all that bad. Head northeast up the road to Timbermaw Hold--don't go into Felpaw Village--and ask the furbolg outside if they have any favors they'd like done. "
804,Salve via Gathering,A Cenarion beacon allows a seasoned herbalist to spot insidious fel creep - a malfeasant product of Felwood's corruption. ,"Excellent work <name> - every bit of this, once we purify it, will help us take back Felwood. Here, take some doses of Cenarion plant salve and head into the forest. The reclaiming of the land from the corruption waits for no <race>! "
805,Fight the Power,Slay 8 Jadefire Rogues or Jadefire Shadowstalkers at the Ruins of Constellas. ,"It's time for the final push against the Jadefire! If you're prepared to break through their foul barrier and bring the fight to their leader, I'd also ask your help against the lesser satyr. Our druids fight ferociously, but your strength can help turn the battle. Show the Jadefire that their power will no longer hold sway over these lands! "
806,Deadwood of the North,Kill 15 Deadwood Furbolg of any kind in Felpaw Village. ,"There is a camp of Deadwood furbolgs directly to our southwest.  Corruption permeates the camp, and I wish to put an end to it before they become a problem. The Deadwood tribe is evil, but it is the effects of the fel that pollutes their minds.  Their hostility is not truly an innate quality, yet they cannot be helped.  It saddens me that we must fight our own brethren. Please, <name> - I ask you to do what must be done.  Simply spare me the details; such troublesome images upset me far too much. "
807,Warchief's Command: Felwood! ,Report to Tenell Leafrunner at the Emerald Sanctuary in Felwood. ,"All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Tenell Leafrunner at the Emerald Sanctuary in Felwood. The Cenarion Circle requires your help to wrest Felwood from the control of demons and other corrupt creatures! To reach the Emerald Sanctuary, travel north from Ashenvale and follow the road until you reach the sanctuary. Destiny calls! "
808,Corrupted Songflower,"You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a songflower plant. ","You apply some Cenarion plant salve to the songflower. It immediately begins to shed its corrupted form, blossoming into a vibrant and healthy plant. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(3363))"
809,A Slimy Situation,Collect 7 Emerald Shimmercaps. ,"This poor fellow here barely escaped Bloodvenom Post with his life! If we're going to keep him from turning into a slime creature like all the others, we've got to treat the infection. Mushrooms like to grow near the bright green waters around here, like the pond to the east beneath the falls. Most of them are no good. . . I need you to collect the bright green glowing ones! If I have those, I'll be able to whip up something tasty to help this poor tauren. Don't take too long now! "
810,Rejoining the Forest,Bring the Flourishing Protector back to the hill in the center of Irontree Woods. ,"It is time to say goodbye now. You have raised me from a seedling, brief though it was, but now I must rejoin the forest. Take me back to the hill you found me on. There I will set my roots, and grow in the shadow of the ancients that came before me. "
811,Squirrely Clean,Scrub 6 Tainted Squirrels. ,"The larger animals are often too far corrupted to save, but you'd be surprised how hardy the little ones are. Take the squirrels, for example. After washing in corrupted water, they can spread illness far from the original source, but it's slow to affect the squirrels themselves. In fact, a simple washing will result in a clean squirrel and a safer forest! Here, take this bottle of cleaning mixture. Grab and scrub any squirrel you see in the woods to the south. . . they'll be thankful for it! "
812,Forces of Jaedenar,Slay 12 Jaedenar Forces. ,"The Shadow Council perpetuates the corruption of this land. At Jaedenar in the northwest, they worship the demons of the Burning Legion, and work to open the path for their masters to return to this world. The grounds are patrolled by Jaedenar Hounds, Guardians, Adepts, and Cultists - thugs that act as lookout for the more vile forces beneath. They will be the first to die so that these forests may no longer suffer! "
813,The Corruption of the Jadefire,Slay 12 Jadefire Satyr or Jadefire Felsworn in Jadefire Glen. ,"The cleansing of this forest has been a grueling process. For every success we have achieved, a new challenge has arisen. The Jadefire satyr have been a constant nuisance. They seek to corrupt the forest just as we seek to cleanse it. Now, we have taken steps to begin eradicating them from Felwood entirely. Travel to Jadefire Glen to the west and rid the forest of their presence. You'll find the entrance just north of the walls of Deadwood Village; look for their vile banners. "
814,Slap and Cap,Slap 7 Panicked Workers to make them cap the oil gushers. ,"Oh for. . . not again! If you heard the deputy yelling out there, that means we've got a fullblown oil leak on our hands! It's those filthy worgen again! Listen, it's going to be total chaos out there. Sleep-deprived goblins running around screaming and not knowing what to do. I need you to snap the workers back to their senses. A good, swift backhand across the face should do it! Once they shake themselves off, they'll get to work capping those gushers! "
815,Bloody Wages,Slay 7 Panicking Workers. ,"Sad little cowards. . . look at them flee in panic! Don't let it fool you, <name>. The second they've regained their wits, those goblins are going to spend every waking moment chopping this forest to bits and sending the pieces to the Horde's war effort. Don't give them the chance. Kill the workers throughout Irontree Clearing without mercy. . . show them their greed has a price! "
816,Winna's Kitten,Collect Kitty's Eartag from Winna's Kitten. ,"Mr. Tauren here's told me a lot about what happened at Bloodvenom Post. He says Winna Hazzard is still there! She's pretty far gone, but what's left of her is making a bunch of new slime. We've got to stop it! Luckily, I have a plan. Mr. Tauren said Winna used to have a kitten. She fed it corrupted slime water and it ran off into the woods. I saw something lurking to the southeast just past the Bloodvenom Tower, but it sure was bigger than a kitten! Go see if the kitty has a tag. . . "
817,Pikwik in Peril,Speak with Foreman Pikwik at Irontree Cavern. ,"What the heck is going on here? Foreman Pikwik should've shut the valves off by now. We can cap these leaks all day and if the central valve is off, we're just delaying an enormous explosion. Listen, if you value money, your life, or either combination of the two, you'd better head south to Irontree Cavern and see if you can find Foreman Pikwik. "
818,Into the Clearing,Speak with Alton Redding near Irontree Cavern. ,"Irontree Clearing must be razed. We can afford no mercy if we want to prevent the goblins from spreading their destruction through the entire forest. Alton Redding, my most trusted protector, has already led much of the pack around the enemy line to strike while they are distracted here. Seek him out to the west, overlooking Irontree Cavern. "
819,See the Invisible,Collect 8 batches of Cursed Ooze from the Ruins of Constellas. ,"Yeah, yeah, your stuck-up mage friend there hit it on the nose. The imps over at Shadowlurk Ridge are hiding the key to the satyr's barrier in the nether. It's right there, but you can't see it or touch it unless you're shifted. I guess you're out of luck though, because only imps can phase shift! So you should just close your eyes, turn around, and let me go. . . It was just a joke! Don't hurt me! I'll need slime from the cursed oozes around these ruins. Bring me enough to cover you from head to toe! "
820,Wisp-napping,Use Darla's Wisp Magnet to collect 5 Talonbranch Wisps. ,"Can you believe these worgen here have wisps?  The night elves showed them all that druid junk and now they've got their precious little wisps too, giving them all the building material they want without having to harm any precious trees. If we had those things, we could pull extra wood out of every tree in our site. Free resources, free profit! That's why I've been working on this containment device. Head to Talonbranch Glade and use it to steal some wisps. Just point and press the button. "
821,The Fate of Bloodvenom Post,Speak with Kelnir Leafsong at Bloodvenom Post. ,"While we dealt with Jaedenar, I sent a friend of mine north to Bloodvenom Post. We used to have infrequent visits from the tauren there, but they have stopped coming as of late. My friend, Kelnir Leafsong, has yet to return. Would you travel north to check on her and the situation at Bloodvenom? Should you find her, do be aware. . . dryads like her tend to strike other races as a bit odd. "
822,Navarax's Gambit,Slay the demon impersonating Arch Druid Navarax. ,"I have been preying on these demonic impostors for some time now, and I have finally gleaned the location of their leader. It is none other than Arch Druid Navarax, the leader of the Emerald Circle. The demon shields himself with innocents. If I entered Whisperwind Grove to hunt him, I would be set upon by ignorant protectors. . . but you! You can catch him unaware. Return to Whisperwind Grove. Climb the druid tower and you'll find Navarax at the top, in his room amidst the boughs. "
823,The Denmother,Take a flight to Talonbranch Glade and speak with Denmother Ulrica. ,"Barely a crow's flight to the north, goblins ravage this forest, clearcutting it to fuel the war machines of the Horde and line their own pockets. This one pays enough pleasant words and crafted lies to the druids here for them to turn a blind eye, afraid to disturb the tenuous neutrality here. The worgen of Talonbranch Glade have had enough. Join us! The hippogryph master can take you directly to our home. Denmother Ulrica will welcome any <race> who wishes to fight. "
824,Crying Violet,Collect 8 Crying Violets. ,"We must prepare carefully before assaulting Jaedenar. The magic of the warlocks and demons within Jaedenar is strong, and we will need wards of our own before entering. We need only one more ingredient: Crying Violet, which grows in the hills near the enemy's stronghold to the northwest. Gather the Crying Violet, then meet my assistant in the field. He will know what to do next. "
825,Hunting the Damned,Slay 6 Infernal Sentries. ,"The first demons to set foot in this forest were infernals. Long ago, these powerful beings of stone and demonic fire fell from the sky to take this land for the Burning Legion. The charred craters of Shatter Scar Vale to the south are where these infernals landed, and many still wander there. They are fierce foes, and killing them is both a worthy challenge and a noble cause. I offer reward for those who join the hunt. Return here afterwards. "
826,Turn It Off! Turn It Off! ,Shut off the Master Control Pump at the bottom of Irontree Cavern. ,"It was those darn worgen! They blew right past me into the cavern. They must've messed with the Master Control Pump! If that thing is left on too long, every pipe runnin' under our feet is gonna blow. You think the leaks now are bad? Just wait! Listen, if you can reach the Master Control Pump all the way in the back of the cavern, you can shut it off and save us all! "
827,Is Your Oil Running? ,Collect 10 Crude Tarballs from Oily Sludges. ,"Last time we had an oil leak this bad, the oil itself tried to get away! I don't know what does it, maybe all the demon goop floating around here, but when we get a big enough crude leak half of it globs together and tries to run away. That's profit trying to escape! Go run after those oil sludges and bring back their sweet, precious oil! "
828,Fire in the Hole! ,Slay Grolvitar the Everburning. ,"Land's sakes, pardner! You done shut off those valves but good. Unfortunately we've had a critical blowout in our gosh-darned central burnoff regulator! Missus Darla's done sent as many workers as she can rustle to go shut it off, but those flames have a mind of their own! Literally! They're hoppin' up and grabbin' anyone who comes near! So Darla says if you can muster up out of that cave you're in and beat that elemental, she's got a mighty fine prize in store for ya! "
829,A Talking Totem,Speak with the Totem of Ruumbo near Deadwood Village. ,"The furbolg village to the south is the home of the Deadwood tribe, sworn enemies of the Timbermaw. They are corrupted and foul like so many others, driven mad by the taint of these woods. Something unusual has occured near the village though. Travelers coming here have said that the totem next to the road has spoken to them. I have heard nothing every time I approach it. Perhaps it will speak to you, <name>? Maybe you can find out what's going on for me. "
830,Purity From Corruption,Fill the Empty Canteen with water from the corrupted moonwell in the center of Jaedenar. ,"The flowers you brought me were the essential ingredient. Protective barriers surround Shadow Hold, projected from demonic braziers. If we are to drive the Shadow Council from Felwood, then those braziers must be extinguished. This vial has been infused with crying violet and the magic of the wilds. Fill it at the corrupted moonwell in the center of Jaedenar and return to me. "
831,Jaedenar Awaits,Deliver the Arcanist's Herbs to Greta Mosshoof at Wildheart Point. ,"The cultists you saw guarding the claw were members of the Shadow Council, foul warlocks behind nearly every attempt to bring demons into Azeroth. North of here is Jaedenar, named in worship of Kil'Jaeden himself. Deep beneath it stretches Shadow Hold, a former barrow den and the Shadow Council's own stronghold on Azeroth. Take these herbs north to Wildheart Point, on the east side of the road. Greta Mosshoof will need them for her plan to purify Shadow Hold for good. "
832,Cleanup at Bloodvenom Post,Slay 6 Bloodvenom Slimeslaves. ,"Blurgh. . . Could you. . . ugh. . . could you please. . . URGH! Excuse me, I'm still a little. . . ugh, my stomach. If you're going to Bloodvenom Post to the west, could you please HUUURGH. . . Just. . . just put what's left of my friends out of their misery. Go RIGHT NOW. For your own good. Uuuuurghh. . . "
833,Weeding the Lawn,Pull up 7 Whisperwind Lashers to check them for corruption. ,"In a place like this, even something as simple as growing flowers and pulling weeds can require some heroic effort. The orchid lashers that grow on all sides of the grove are a sign of healing. But they're not flawless; some of them do succumb to demonic corruption now and then. I've found the best way to check is to just pull them up. If they're normal, they'll wander around a bit and reroot themselves. If they aren't. . . well, you'd better be ready for a fight! "
834,Wisps of the Woods,Use the Swiftwind Switch to collect 5 Talonbranch Wisps. ,"I have toiled long here with the Denmother to spread the teachings of Cenarius and the ways of the wild. She has gained much of my trust, and in return, I have been allowed to introduce the spirits of the forest to her students. The company of wisps is a great honor, as well as a useful blessing. But now the goblins descend on us, and seek to steal the wisps for nefarious use. Please, prevent this blasphemy! Call the wisps back here from the western woods with this blessed branch, and keep them safe. "
835,Singin' in the Sun,Guide the Sapling Protector to 5 shafts of sunlight in Irontree Woods. ,"We're growing so much bigger. . . It's time to shine! Time to spread our leaves to the sun! Take me to the sun! The sun is far away, but its light comes to us. Its light makes us big and strong again. The light comes down the big branches to the little ones like ours. Over there! The sun comes to us in the north! Take us with you, take us to dance! "
836,The Demon Prince,Slay Prince Xavalis. ,"The Jadefire satyr that have overrun so much of Felwood work directly with the Shadow Council. These satyr answer directly to the ancient and powerful Prince Xavalis. Some say he is the son of Xavius, the first satyr, blessed by Sargeras himself. Whatever his nature, he must die if we are to scatter the Jadefire and reclaim our barrow dens. Journey deep into Shadow Hold and slay him. Show him no mercy; he will have none for you. "
837,The Core of Kroshius,Obtain Kroshius' Infernal Core. ,"The most fearsome demon in Shatter Scar Vale is known as Kroshius. Though many have hunted him over the years, destruction has only made him stronger. Time after time, warlocks have come to this forest and reanimated Kroshius. He now lurks in the southeast, surrounded by demonic fire, awaiting any who come to try and claim his power. I will not have this corrupt cycle continue! Kill Kroshius, and bring his infernal core to me. "
838,These Roots Were Made For Stompin',Slay 10 Irontree Stompers. ,"There's so many other spirits still trapped in rotting bodies here. . . Do you see? The irontree stompers, in the north. They're sick with demon-stuff and icky with mold. Poor spirits inside them can't get out. You can help! Chop them down, and the spirits can get out. I'll put the spirits in me and we can all be happy together when I grow up. Will you help? Please? "
839,Speak to Salfa,Travel through Timbermaw Hold and exit into Winterspring. ,"The threat of corruption comes not only from the Deadwood furbolgs to the south, but also from the east and the Winterfall furbolgs of Winterspring.  If you wish to further aid us, speak with Salfa on the other side of the Hold, by the Winterspring entrance.  Follow the path to the left to reach it. "
840,The Tainted Ooze,Slay 8 Tainted Oozes. ,"This all started with Winna Hazzard. She was a forsaken apothecary at Bloodvenom Post, researching ways to use the demonic ooze here against the Alliance. We warned her she was going too far, but she didn't listen, and we did not act fast enough. Now her and everyone at Bloodvenom Post are nothing more than mindless slime creatures. . . The disgusting oozes she used for this still roam near the pools to the east and south. I beg you, <class>, destroy them so that others cannot commit such evil. "

The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but a palpable sense of despair emanates from it.  If there were any object that might best exemplify the corruption that the Deadwood furbolg suffer under, this item would clearly be it.

850,Oil and Irony,Sabotage the Master Control Pump at the bottom of Irontree Cavern. ,"I plan to use the goblin's greed and pollution against them.

I'm gonna stay here a while and look after poor Mr. Tauren until he stops throwing up so much. Why don't you head north to Whisperwind Grove?

853,Report to the Denmother,Speak with Denmother Ulrica at Talonbranch Glade. ,"With the goblins scattered and their equipment destroyed, they'll either get the message and leave, or be easy pickings if they choose to stay.

856,Running Their Course,Slay 8 Felrot Coursers. ,"I'd love so much to save every creature in the forest, but as you probably have seen, some are just too far gone. When we first founded Whisperwind Grove, the woods just to the south were full of beautiful coursers, majestic and gentle creatures.

I'll make you a deal: You run in there and get those explosives gathered up, and I will stay here and not get killed by swamp-things, and if you don't either, I'll pay ya! How's that sound? "
861,The Last Protector,Defeat the Withered Protector. ,"Ahhh. . . thank you, little <race>. I and others have tried so many times to grow in this forest, without success. The Withered Protector that lurks in the north is the only ancient to have grown to maturity since the ruining of the forest, but his body is sick and his mind is mad.

Reports say it looks like a sasquatch, but if it is, it's the biggest ever seen in Feralas. The ogres are most likely trying to teach it to obey them. While that's almost comical, I'm not going to sit by and let them train that thing to roll over at their command. Return to the hills and slay it. "
878,Ogre Abduction,Use the Modified Soulstone to capture a Gordok ogre. ,"There's no way the Gordunni made these. They're being supplied. Someone is giving them gifts of power, and we need to find out who. The upper-class Gordok that guard Dire Maul will know more about this. Orhan is no doubt having you thin their numbers, but I'll need one alive. Take the orb back. It's similar to a Soulstone, so I've made some. . . adjustments.

The creatures of this forest, our ancestral home, have protected us for centuries. We simply need to rally them. Take this whistle. Our allies know this sound, and you'll be using it to recall them. Before you start gathering creatures, I'd like you to recall a few of our wisps, just for practice. You can find them just outside the fortress, among the trees. "
908,Tears of Stone,Collect 7 Stonetears. ,"As you witnessed, the dragon Ysondre has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems. Her words ring true; in the glade to the west, I have seen the mountain giants distraught. They raged in frustration and wept, and their tears fell upon the stones as shining crystals. Though the giants weep no more, these stonetears must be what Ysondre referred to. We must gather them. "
909,Taming The Tamers,Kill 6 Gordunni Tamers. ,"The sasquatch may be a larger threat, but we also need to wipe out the ogres. The Gordunni have been a nuisance to us for too long, and Lady Shandris wants them completely gone.  Let's hope these are the last ones. Kill the Gordunni tamers that keep the beast chained, and make sure they know the price of their meddling. "
910,Signs of Change,Collect 8 Infected Stag Antlers. ,"A severe illness has fallen over the creatures of this forest. While at first I hoped it was part of nature's course, it has refused to pass. The forest stags, normally strong and serene, have suffered the worst. Some waste away in weakness; others froth and rage dangerously. If I am to consult the spirits to learn more of this sickness, I will need the stags' antlers. "
911,The Lost Apprentice,Look for the Lost Apprentice in the Darkmist Ruins. ,"If you have a moment, <class>. . . One of the students I was teaching has gone to explore the darkmist ruins to the south by himself. I warned him that it was too dangerous, but he was too excited to listen.  I had spoken with him earlier about an amulet that is concealed within those ruins.  Now, I fear that he may have run off in search of it, because of me. . . Estulan has forbidden us to pursue him. If you go there, could you please look for him? "
912,General Skessesh,Slay General Skessesh and take his head. ,The leader of these forces must fall! The naga's offensive will be broken with no one to command them. I saw the coward retreat into one of the abandoned buildings here. Cut your way through the others and take his head! Lady Shandris will want to see it for herself. 
913,The Gordunni Threat,Kill 16 Gordunni Ogres in the High Wilderness. ,"Within the High Wilderness to the south lay countless ancient ruins. It's there that the ancestors of the night elves fooled about with arcane magic, and it's there that the Gordunni ogres wander, searching for leftover scraps. You'll notice the forest is completely destroyed in that area; the ogres leave only useless muck in their wake, depriving the Horde of valuable resources. Go and slay the Gordunni there, <name>. Secure the area for the Horde, and only for the Horde! "
914,The Gordunni Orb,Collect a Gordunni Orb from a Gordunni Warlock. ,"While you're down there cracking skulls. . . I've gotten reports that make me think these ogres may be more than the usual lumbering threat. The Warlocks among them have been seen carrying orbs, possibly items of empowerment. It would be easy to dismiss them as crude trinkets, but I need to make sure we're not surprised. Bring me back one of these orbs. "
915,Stinglasher,Kill Stinglasher in the Writhing Deep. ,"Most of the insects we've seen wandering the hive have been enormous enough, but my scouts reported an especially huge one. It's supposedly a massive wasp, and it seemed to be directing the workers on the surface. I don't know much about these things, but if they're starting to wander beyond that pit in the ground, we need to put a stop to it. Kill this giant wasp and return to me. "
916,Alpha Strike,Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas. ,"Gnolls are unfortunately as resilient as they are brutish and stupid. I have driven back the gnolls time after time from our camp, and it is only our chieftain's mercy that prevents them from being wiped out entirely. Over the years, it has fallen into a dance of strength and dominance. When their numbers surge and they threaten the camp, the alphas, the strongest gnolls, must be slain. This will drive them back into the forest, and leave us is peace until they forget their lessons. "
917,To Stonemaul Hold,Speak with Orhan Ogreblade in Stonemaul Hold. ,"You must send word of what has happened here, <name>. To the south is Stonemaul Hold. There, our allies have gathered the few ogres of the horde to fight against those despoiling these forests. Speak with Orhan Ogreblade. She leads the Stonemaul clan here, and will need to know of all that has occured. And be wary, lest some of this corruption remain. . . "
918,Forces of Nature: Faerie Dragons,Use Jesana's Faerie Dragon Call to rally 10 Sprite Dragons or Sprite Darters. ,"You wouldn't know it from looking at them, but the lovely faerie dragons that inhabit this forest can be truly fearsome if trained properly. They can do amazing things to magical energy. . . absorb it, redirect it, even nullify it entirely. They're nearly harmless alone, but in large numbers, they can have a stunning effect on a battle. You can find some in the fields to the northwest, but be careful, the Horde is nearby. "
919,Zukk'ash Infestation,"Bring 20 Zukk'ash Carapaces to Hadoken Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas. ","From what scouting we have managed to muster, we believe that the foe south of the gnolls is an insect-like race.  Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not they're sentient.  If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls. Dive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.  Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork. "
920,Perfect Yeti Hide,Bring the Perfect Yeti Hide to Jangdor Swiftstrider at Stonemaul Hold in Feralas. ,"You have found what may very well be a perfect yeti hide.  You easily note that it is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar. Considering that Jangdor Swiftstrider at Stonemaul Hold is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him. "
921,"The Land, Corrupted",Kill 6 Corrupted Cliff Giants. ,"The cliff giants of Feralas are extensions of the earth itself, <name>. When nature thrives, they are benevolent protectors and peaceful guardians. But as the forest is tainted, so too are they. Should they be corrupted by this malady, they will lash out in violence against trees, wildlife, and the very boulders they were shaped from. Be wary in your tasks. Should you find any corrupted giants, destroy them, for the sake of those still spared. "
922,The Gordunni Threat,Kill 16 Gordunni ogres in the High Wilderness. ,"Estulan, the Highborne up in the tower, is reclusive. I haven't been able to speak to him very much. He has, however, told me that the ruins of the High Wilderness to the south are full of Gordunni ogres. The ogres are not only a threat, they're destroying any forest and wildlife nearby. Estulan has also warned me of what might happen if they discover any artifacts of Highborne power among the ruins. . . Head south, <name>, and slay any Gordunni you find! "
923,Ysondre's Farewell,Speak to Adella at Shadebough. ,"With that, I am the only one left. Even if I choose to remain in this world, I cannot rejoin the green flight. But this victory gives me hope. Perhaps, in time, I can find peace in a simple life among mortals. You must return to your people. Tell them that the dragons of nightmare are gone, and will no longer threaten these lands. "
924,Tell Silvia,Talk to Silvia at the Tower of Estulan. ,"It seems we've found an infestation far worse than the one we expected. Cho'gall is no doubt trying to use the Gordok to gain access to the remnants of Eldre'thalas within Dire Maul, full of the forbidden powers that brought the downfall of the Shen'dralar. . . I am rambling. Leave me, <name>. Tell Silvia of what you've learned. Whatever is occuring in Dire Maul must be stopped. "
925,Woodpaw Investigation,Find the gnoll battle plans somewhere in the gnoll camps to the south of Camp Mojache. ,"Gnolls aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, but they will no doubt have some sort of documented strategy on their recent activity.  If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up. I want you to head back to the Woodpaw and find anything that might resemble their battle plans.  They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them.  Find them, and return to me when you have them. "
926,To Camp Mojache,Speak with Chief Spirithorn in Camp Mojache. ,"You've done a hell of a job here, <name>. With the Twilight's Hammer shamed and the Gordunni left bleeding and broken, we'll be able to set our sights on the true battle with the Alliance here. It'll take time to build our forces enough to match the night elves infesting this place. I'm sending you ahead to Camp Mojache to the east; they've got problems of their own, and we can't let any Horde territory fall here. Lok'tar! "
927,Treant Muisek,Kill 3 Wandering Forest Walkers. ,"The wandering forest walkers that can be found meandering through the forest are our next target, <name>. Night elves have enlisted treants as allies to fight against the horde. Their movement may be slow, but their role as protectors is undeniable. Soon we will be able to use this power for our own benefit. Find three wandering forest walkers; kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them. "
928,Ysondre's Farewell,Speak to Chief Spirithorn in Camp Mojache. ,"With that, I am the only one left. Even if I choose to remain in this world, I cannot rejoin the green flight. But this victory gives me hope. Perhaps, in time, I can find peace in a simple life among mortals. You must return to your people. Tell them that the dragons of nightmare are gone, and will no longer threaten these lands. "
929,Forces of Nature: Treants,Use Tessina's Whistle to rally 6 Wandering Forest Walkers. ,"Some people think treants are good for little more than fetching drinks in a war. Most of them haven't seen an entire defensive line scattered by what they thought was cover. And have you ever seen a peon try to chop one down and get surprised? I was in tears. . . At any rate, they're immensely valuable allies. You'll find some wandering just outside  the Tower of Estulan and more in forest to the east, just southeast of Dire Maul. Be on the lookout for the Horde! "
930,Alpha Strike,Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas. ,"Never underestimate a threat. These gnolls may seem like simple brutes, but there's animal cunning even among them. The gnolls run as a pack, and every pack has Alphas: The biggest, strongest, and most ruthless members that claw their way to dominance. They're the ones giving orders, so they're the ones we're going to slay now. They reside mostly around the Woodpaw Den, pushing the others around. Get out there and push harder. "
931,Hippogryph Muisek,"Kill 10 Frayfeather Hippogryphs of any type, then use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture them. ","The next step is hippogryphs. As Master Uzer'i always said, hippogryphs have been loyal companions to the night elves for many years, an' their spirits are loyal and steadfast. I don't think they'll miss a few, and I don't care if they do. We need the muisek of 10 frayfeather hippogyphs in the wilderness to the south. "
932,The Battle Plans,Bring the Woodpaw Battle Plans to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache. ,"With the battle plans of the gnolls discovered, all that now remains is to bring the plans back to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.  Perhaps he or someone there can make further sense of what the gnolls are up to. "
933,Return to Sage Palerunner,Bring the Darkmist Amulet to Sage Palerunner. ,"The soft glow from the pedestal brightens, and you can see a simple chain left behind. This must be the amulet Sage Palerunner sent you here for. . . "
934,Adella's Covert Camp,Report to Adella at Shadebough in Feralas. ,"Lady Shandris has already asked for you to assist us further. Adella has struck out to the east, among the woodpaw gnolls, and established a foothold south of Camp Mojache. You are to report to her if you wish to assist Lady Shandris and the Alliance further. Don't stray too close to Camp Mojache. . . the Horde will not hesitate to attack. Keep to the south and look for our banners. "
935,Rulers of Dire Maul,Kill 6 Gordok Enforcers and 6 Gordok Ogre-Mages. ,"Now that we've put the hurt on them at the ruins, it's time to attack the ogres in their own territory. The Gordok are the ""upper class"" of the Gordunni clan, chosen to defend Dire Maul. They'll know we mean business once we start taking out their strongest members. Nothing fancy here, <name>. Just get out there and crack some Gordok skulls. "
936,A New Cloak's Sheen,Bring 10 Iridescent Sprite Darter Wings to Krueg Skullsplitter in Camp Mojache. ,"Well met, <class>. I've traveled with my companions down to Feralas on a mission for our Orgrimmar masters. My life-mate Korrin finds great pleasure in new clothing, so I aim to make her a new cloak adorned with the gossamer wings of faerie dragons. Would you be able to help me? Sprite darters with the gorgeous wings I want are west of Camp Mojache. "
937,Gordok Guards,Kill 6 Gordok Enforcers and 6 Gordok Ogre-Mages. ,"With the nearby ogres dealt with, we should take the offensive and press our attack into their territory. The Gordok ogres are the head of the Gordunni clan, ruling them from the ruins now called Dire Maul. They are stronger than the lesser Gordunni, but I have no doubt you can handle them, <name>. They won't know what hit them. "
938,Return to Vestia,Bring the Darkmist Amulet to Vestia Moonspear at the Tower of Estulan. ,"The soft glow from the pedestal brightens, and you can see a simple chain left behind. Is this what the apprentice was searching for? "
939,Twisted Sisters,Kill 7 Corrupted Dryads. ,"I have heard of your battle against the corrupted dragons, <name>, and I thank you for your courage. . . but I have disturbing news. The dryads of the forest, though allies of the Night Elves, have always passed us by in peace. But they have become cruel and twisted, attacking any who wander the eastern wilds. I fear for the safety of the refugees here, <name>. Please, put a stop to these twisted dryads. "
940,Sasquatch Sighting,Kill Bigfist. ,"You may have seen this with your own eyes, but my longrunners have reported something disturbing to me. The gordunni in the hills have captured an enormous sasquatch from the wilds. I don't know how long it's been held, but ogres are not ones for hobbies. I fear they plan to unleash the tortured beast on Camp Mojache. Return to the deepest corner of the Gordunni Outpost and slay the sasquatch, <name>. "
941,Tears of Stone,Collect 7 Stonetears. ,"As you witnessed, the dragon Ysondre has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems. Weeks ago, in the glade to the west, I saw the mountain giants distraught. They raged in frustration and wept, and their tears fell upon the stones as shining crystals. Though the giants weep no more, these stonetears must be what Ysondre referred to; a source of nature's purity. We must gather them. "
942,Ysondre's Call,Speak with Ysondre at the Emerald Summit in the Lower Wilds. ,"The dragons of nature. . . Heed her call, <name>. Do not linger here. Her request for your aid is both a great honor and an omen of terrible danger. The place she spoke of is called the Emerald Summit. A path off the main road through the Lower Wilds leads up one of the high stone plateaus; you will find a small shrine at the top. All of Feralas may rest upon your shoulders. May the Earth Mother watch over you. "
943,Spiteful Sisters,Kill 8 Corrupted Dryads. ,"Something truly disturbing has occured. While on patrol, several of my scouts were ambushed by dryads. The dryads are close allies of the night elves and guardians of the forest. I assumed they were just frightened by the sight of worgen, but the sentinels I sent out afterwards were also attacked. Whatever is going on, I don't like it. I want you to go investigate as well. If even the dryads have been corrupted. . . put them to the sword. "
944,The Mark of Quality,Collect 10 Thick Yeti Hides. ,"I take pride in my leather work, and I feel it shows; quality should never be compromised.  Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter would also have you believe that the earth does not keep secrets! In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have discovered thick yeti hides.  Yetis are native to Feralas, often found north of here in Rage Scar Hold.  I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that is agreeable to you, then we are set! "
945,The Flow of Muisek,Deliver the Muisek Vessel to Witch Doctor Uzer'i at Camp Mojache in Feralas. ,"I've done all I can for you. Muisek stronger than the hippogryph just isn't within my power to work with yet, so I won't make you deal with the disaster that could bring. But while you've been busy, I've fully readied the hippogryph muisek. Take it to my master, Witch Doctor Uzer'i in Camp Mojache. He can create powerful weapons with it, and hopefully he'll be impressed by what I've done. "
946,Hatecrest Forces,Kill 10 Hatecrest Naga. ,"The Hatecrest are fighting fiercely! Their leader is a priority, but we need to kill as many of them as we can. Go ahead of me, I'll meet you on the battlefield. Show them no mercy! "
947,Mountain Giant Muisek,Kill 7 Mountain Giants. ,"The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the Burning Legion appeared in the world. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain. I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek. "
948,A Grim Discovery,Bring 20 Grimtotem Horns to Krueg Skullsplitter in Camp Mojache. ,"The Grimtotem clan! Those gutless traitors are still lurking around here, eh. . . You have to go back, <class>. Go back and bring me their horns. . . piles of them if you can. The Grimtotem are not to be trifled with or underestimated. Go back and slay them; let the rivers in Feralas run red with their dark blood. "
949,Estulan's Examination,Deliver the Gordunni Orb to Estulan. ,"He's right. I haven't been among the night elves long, but I can tell these markings are completely unlike any kaldorei decorations. . . Estulan needs to see this. Take this up the tower to him. He may be surly, but don't be dissuaded; once he sees the orb, he'll realize it's an important issue. "
950,Ysondre's Call,Speak with Ysondre atop the Emerald Summit in the Lower Wilds. ,"A dragon of the emerald dream. . . what have you gotten yourself involved in, <name>? I wouldn't keep her waiting if I were you. The place she spoke of is what we call the Emerald Summit. A path off the main road through the Lower Wilds leads up one of the high stone plateaus; there's a small shrine at the top. Good luck, <name>. I hope to see you back safe. "
951,Pristine Yeti Hide,"Bring the Pristine Yeti Hide to Pratt McGrubben at the Feathermoon Stronghold, Feralas. ","You have found a pristine yeti hide that is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar. Considering that Pratt McGrubben at the Feathermoon Stronghold is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him. "
952,"The Land, Corrupted",Kill 7 Corrupted Cliff Giants. ,"The cliff giants of Feralas are extensions of the earth itself, <name>. When nature thrives, they are benevolent protectors and peaceful guardians. But as the forest is tainted, so too are they. If the corruption has spread to them, they will lash out at the wildlife and their own kind, causing great destruction. You must destroy any corrupted giants you come across. "
953,Feralas Ruins Ramble - Challenge,Glide through the rings. ,Fly through the checkpoint rings marking the course. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(76059))
954,The Battle of Sardor,Speak with Tambre on Sardor Isle. ,"Our settlement on Sardor Isle was lost to the Hatecrest naga. Overwhelmed by their numbers, we fell back to the mainland. While they coveted their newly-gained sandbar, we raised New Feathermoon on the shore and amassed an even greater army. Now, the Hatecrest will be driven back into the sea. Find our Ancient of War along the shore. He will take you to the front lines, where Tambre leads the offensive. "
955,Forces of Nature: Hippogryphs,Use Tessina's Whistle to rally 10 Frayfeather Hippogryphs. ,"Hippogryphs are majestic creatures. Some say they were created by Cenarius himself as a gift for the night elves. They're wary of other races, but they're intelligent enough to recognize a friend of a friend. I need more hippogryphs here so we can begin training some of our newer archers to ride them. Take the whistle again and rally the Frayfeather hippogyphs in the grove just south of the Tower of Estulan. "
956,"It's Not ""Ogre"" Yet",Kill 5 Gordunni Hillguards. ,"We dealt the Gordunni ogres a large blow at Dire Maul, but we haven't quite finished the job. My scouts have reported a group of them amassed in the hills to the north, gathering for some reason. It's possible they're interested in the Horde settlement nearby, but I don't want to take any chances. Scout the area, kill any ogres you come across, and report back. "
957,Vengeance on the Northspring,Kill 6 Northspring Harpies and 6 Northspring Windcallers. ,"In my day, I was a seasoned hunter. There wasn't any creature around that I feared. Until. . . I was out in the forest, sharpening my blade after a tough battle, when I was ambushed. Harpies surrounded me, and I barely managed to drag myself to safety. Even now, I can still hear their cries echoing. . . I was never the same after that. But the hate boils inside of me -- I must get even, after all these years. The Northspring harpies can be found to the west of here. <name>, get my revenge. "
958,Taming The Tamers,Kill 6 Gordunni Tamers. ,"The gordunni are not known to tame animals. If they're learning, this is cause for alarm. While the sasquatch they've tamed may be the major threat to our camp, the gordunni who captured him should be dealt with as well. If left, they may simply capture another. Kill the gordunni tamers, and make sure the ogres know their efforts will not be tolerated! "
959,Talk to Swar'jan,Deliver the Gordunni Orb to Swar'jan in Stonemaul Hold. ,"We're lucky and unlucky here, grunt. Lucky that I had you bother to bring this back, and unlucky that my suspicions turned out to hold water. This thing's full of corrupted stench. It's far too new to be something fished out of the ruins, either. Someone is supplying these ogres, and we need to know who before this becomes a situation. Get that filthy thing upstairs to Swar'jan, the warlock on top of the guard tower. He's good for a few ideas; I'd listen to his suggestions, if I were you. "
960,The Northspring Menace,Kill 6 Northspring Harpies and 6 Northspring Windcallers. ,"My duty here is to watch over Telaron. Even without his meditation leaving him vulnerable, there's enough threats in this forest to keep both of us on our toes. That's why it maddens me so much that I don't have the opportunity to leave camp. More harpies than I've ever seen infest the northwest. . . foul creatures, spreading their filth across the ancient ruins uncaringly. They're a threat to this camp, and have no place in these lands. I'll pay you well if you get rid of them. "
961,The Mark of Quality,Collect 10 Thick Yeti Hides. ,"My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises. Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in Dun Morogh! In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides. The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Rage Scar Hold to the northeast. I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that sounds fair, then we're in business. "
962,Report to Silvia,Report to Silvia at the Tower of Estulan. ,"A Highborne mage named Estulan, estranged from his surviving brothers, has built a tower to the east where he trains young night elves in arcane magic. Were it not for Lady Tyrande's recent mercy towards his kind, his execution would be my duty under the law. He will be watched closely, but I will not deny aid to my Sentinels simply out of pride. I've sent Silvia ahead to the Tower of Estulan to begin an offensive against the ogres infesting the nearby forest. Report to her for further orders. "
963,The Hilltop Threat,Kill 5 Gordunni Hillguards. ,"I am proud of Mojache's reputation as a safe haven in the wilds of Feralas, but the camp faces many threats. The Gordunni ogres gather nearby in the northern foothills, claiming their territory and despoiling the wildlife. With the arrival of our brothers and sisters seeking shelter, I cannot let them linger any more. Go north and drive the ogres out. "

968,Improved Quality,Collect 10 Feral Scar Yeti Hides. ,"It's funny how things change. The northern yetis used to yield the best hides, but these. . . there's been a decline in quality, it seems. Maybe something nearby is making them sick. Luckily, the Feral Scar yetis to the southeast have flourished. I bet their hides are even better than they used to be! I would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business. "
969,Improved Quality,Collect 10 Feral Scar Yeti Hides from Feral Scar Yeti. ,"I'm a bit confused. The Rage Scar yeti used to be the finest source of leather in these lands. . . but these pelts are weak and even rotted in spots. Some sort of illness must be plaguing the creatures. I'll have to rely on a different source. The yeti of Feral Scar Vale to the south have hides nearly as strong. They are also a great deal fiercer; do not hunt them without caution, <class>. "
970,Moonglade Calls,Travel to Moonglade and speak with Loganaar in Nighthaven. ,"I have received word that our brothers in Moonglade have requested your help, <name>. You should travel there and speak with Loganaar in Nighthaven. He will tell you all you need to know. "
971,Elementary! ,Activate the four nearby elemental crucibles in the correct order to take control of the Eye of Twilight. ,"<You can't read the text, but diagrams seem to indicate that the devices around you should be activated in a set order. ><One passage of the Apocrypha has been translated to modern text: >In the beginning was shadow eternal. Hate blazed forth, and FIRE was born. Wounds scabbed, and so begat EARTH. Cries of anguish birthed howling WIND. Wherein the skies wept seas of TEARS. We live in the shadow, The world we knowBuilt of rage, hurt, anguish and sorrow. "
972,Hero's Call: Mount Hyjal! ,Speak to Cenarion Emissary Jademoon to secure transportation to Moonglade. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade. Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground! Speak with Cenarion Emissary Jademoon in Stormwind Keep to gain entry into Moonglade. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! Fight on, <brother/sister>! "
973,Warchief's Command: Mount Hyjal! ,Speak to Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof to secure transportation to Moonglade. ,"All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade. Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground! Speak with Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof to gain entry into Moonglade. Blackhoof is located at the tauren district in the Valley of Wisdom in Orgrimmar. Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls! "
974,Protect the World Tree,Speak to Malfurion Stormrage at the Tranquil Grove in Mount Hyjal. ,"< Ysera 's eyes look distant, as if not fully acknowledging you. >I feel it as well, <class>. Ragnaros has arrived. We must defeat his minions before he can join them and lend them his strength. Seek Malfurion Stormrage at the Tranquil Grove, west of here, and aid his forces in any way you can. I must seek answers from within the Emerald Dream.  You must protect the World Tree until I return. "
975,A Prayer and a Wing,Use the Enormous Bird Call at one of Blaithe's Nests perched atop the Rim of the World. ,"A winged visage? Could it be. . . ? <name>, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to Aviana herself, trying to return to us. I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking this shrine, you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief. Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers. "
976,Egg Wave,Equip a Twilight Firelance and fly Aviana's Guardian. ,"Without any defenders, the Firelands eggs are vulnerable. Take wing once more and smash those eggs! Simply rush over them to crush them. Search all the nooks, crannies, and side-caves. Hurry! "

But at least the inferno seems to be subsiding. >< Matoclaw will want to know what happened here. She's waiting for you back at the Grove of Aessina. >
978,The Bears Up There,"Climb up trees in the Whistling Grove, grab stranded Hyjal Bear Cubs, and then hurl them at the Soft Target from the top of the tree. ","Do not fear the bears in this grove, <class> - I have pacified them for the moment. My concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground! Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here. Nothing can go wrong with this plan. "
979,Graduation Speech,Use the Initiation Podium at Doom's Vigil to successfully deliver the Graduation Speech. ,"You're finally ready, <name>damus. I am so proud of you and all you've accomplished. Today you will deliver a speech in front of your peers and inspire them to crush our enemies until Hyjal is nothing but a pile of ash. Remember, <name>damus.  It'll be important to read your audience's emotions and use words that best address those emotions. "
980,The Firelord,Go through the portal at the Sanctum of the Prophets and aid Cenarius in defeating Ragnaros. ,"With his gatekeeper gone, you've given the Guardians of Hyjal access to Sulfuron Spire. Ragnaros will have no choice but to defend the main entryway to the Firelands himself. Go through the Twilight's Hammer portal at the Sanctum of the Prophets and meet me inside.  Malfurion and Hamuul will also aid us while the others continue to fight the enemy outside. "
981,Egg Hunt,Disable the Shadow Cloak Generators until you unveil Aviana's Egg. ,"Skylord Omnuron wants us to find Aviana's Egg, and I can almost guarantee you it's cloaked by one of Sethria's shadow devices. Search around the camp for shadow cloak generators and shut those things down until you find the egg. Once you've unveiled it, I'll call out to the other druids. Defend that egg until we can carry it off to safety. Go get that egg, <name>! "
982,Walking the Dog,Collect and feed 5 pieces of Charred Basilisk Meat to the Spawn of Smolderos. ,"Hmmmphh. . . . it seems they'll let anyone in these days. Very well.  You doubtlessly became acquainted with Smolderos in the proving grounds. Well, I've been entrusted with the care of one of his pups.  Quite the little terror -- if he grows up to be anything like his father he shall serve our cause well. Collect meat from the basilisks around the area and feed them to him. "
983,The Last Living Lorekeeper,"Seek out Nordu, an Ancient of Lore, at the Flamewake in Mount Hyjal. ","You have awakened the ancients, <name>, but the wilderness spirit Aessina remains silent. With her help, we can turn the tide of this attack and undo the damage Twilight's Hammer has done. There may be one who can help us. The oldest of the trees, Nordu, stood in the center of what is now the Flamewake for thousands of years. His wisdom is as old as this mountain. If that old tree still lives, perhaps he can awaken Aessina. . . seek him out. "
984,Commander Jarod Shadowsong,Speak to Elementalist Ortell at Darkwhisper Pass. ,Only once has there been a leader capable of commanding demigods and mortals alike. His name was Jarod Shadowsong and his ability to lead in battle was such that Cenarius and the other ancients placed themselves under his command. He disappeared for years and his whereabouts were unknown.  Until now. He is being held captive inside a Twilight camp in Darkwhisper Gorge. Your job is to infiltrate their ranks and free Jarod.  Speak to the one known as Ortell at Darkwhisper Pass to the southeast. 
985,Last Stand at Whistling Grove,Report to Keeper Taldros at Whistling Grove in Mount Hyjal. ,"We might have a chance to beat these flames back thanks to your work in the Inferno.

986,The Return of the Ancients,Speak to Oomla Whitehorn at Wolf's Run in Hyjal. ,"It'll be crucial to reclaim each of the ancients' shrines, <name>. Follow the road west of the Verdant Thicket, into Wolf's Run. We have operatives stationed there.  Aid them in any way that you can and work your way to the first shrine. The wolf god was known to the elves as Goldrinn and to the orcs as Lo'Gosh.  He will be a fierce ally in our fight against the enemy. "
987,Crushing the Cores,"Acquire 8 Smoldering Cores by killing Searing Guardians, then smash them against a Twilight Anvil. ","These searing guardians are murderous!

Smash them on the Twilight Anvils, and destroy them for good! "
988,As Hyjal Burns,Fly to Hyjal using Aronus and speak to Ysera once you're there. ,<name>!  We've heard much about you and your previous accomplishments. It is good that you've come here just as Azeroth finds itself in a time of great need. Deathwing's minions are attacking Hyjal and seek to bring the destructive Ragnaros back into our world. Aronus will take you to join Malfurion's forces in Hyjal. Lend them what help you can. 
989,Vigilance on Wings,Equip a Twilight Firelance and fly Aviana's Guardian. ,"The agents of Twilight continue their assault within this pocket of the Firelands. We must not let our offensive fall! Take wing, and destroy as many of those lancers as you can! Do not forget to pick up and equip your lance first. "
990,Save the Wee Animals,Go into the Inferno and rescue any combination of 10 Panicked Bunnies or Terrified Squirrels. ,"Help us, <class>! The forest is aflame, and the wee animals can't find their way out. They can't fight for themselves, with their teeny-tiny little teeth and their soft furry paws! They're fluffy and sweet. They have wet little noses! If you don't save them, I don't want to even THINK about it. <She slaps her palms over her eyes. >I'm not thinking! "
991,Seeds of Discord,Distract Karr'gonn and slay Dark Cultist Azennios at the Seat of the Chosen in Hyjal. ,"According to the intelligence you acquired, there is major friction between the ogres and non-ogres in the cult. High Cultist Azennios and the ogre mage Karr'gonn are meeting at the Seat of the Chosen in an attempt to ease the conflict. There is an outhouse like this one at the Seat of the Chosen.  Go there and put on this ogre disguise.  Find a way to kill Azennios while he's in this mission of peace. We must exploit this division as much as we can! "
992,Flames from Above,Seek the Twilight Encampment north of Nordrassil and use Tholo's Horn. ,"We've identified the general direction where the infiltrators have been coming from, thanks to your work. Now we just need to shut down their camp and put an end to their operations this side of Nordrassil. Take this horn.  It will signal one of our emerald drakes to swoop down and give these Twilight cultists a taste of the flames they so madly worship. "
993,Signed in Blood,Lure a Twilight Recruit away from the group and take his Twilight Recruitment Papers. ,"You're here at last, <name>.  Just in time as well. News of Ragnaros' emergence has spurred a large wave of recruits to seek membership in the Twilight's Hammer. If you're to infiltrate the cult, the time is now.  We will need recruitment papers -- signed in blood by a referring Twilight member.  Lure one of the new recruits away from the group and hit them with this blackjack. If you're lucky, you'll be able to steal his recruitment papers.  Bring them back to me and we'll do our best to alter them. "
994,A Prisoner of Interest,Speak to Captain Saynna Stormrunner at the Barrow Dens in Hyjal. ,"The Twilight's Hammer wants to free Fandral Staghelm? Malfurion suspected his corruption ran deep. . . this just cements it. At any rate we cannot allow our enemies to get their hands on such a powerful arch druid. I've a plan, <name>.  We will move the prisoner through the Emerald Dream.  It will be risky, but with all the cultists present here it might be the only way to guarantee our success. Speak to Saynna Stormrunner inside the Barrow Dens to the northeast. "
995,Gar'gol's Gotta Go,Get the Rusted Skull Key from Gar'gol's Personal Treasure Chest. ,"<Kristoff cranes his neck, trying to look you in the eye. >Listen, you gotta get me outta here. They're either going to eat me or turn me over to the Twilight's Hammer. Maybe both. They've padlocked me in, and Gar'gol keeps the key in his personal treasure chest. Kill Gar'gol if you have to - but get that key! <Kristoff flails his limbs, helplessly. >"
996,From the Mouth of Madness,"Gather up Stonebloom, Bitterblossom, and a Darkflame Ember. ","I know of a draught that should jolt these gibbering former slaves back to reality. Gather some stonebloom from the rocks around Gar'gol's hovel, some bitterblossom from the shores of the nearby lake, and a darkflame ember from one of the braziers at the hovel entrance. The draught won't last long, so combine the ingredients at a twilight cauldron by the entrance to the hovel. One sip of that draught should knock some sense into the brainwashed slaves! "
997,An Ancient Reborn,Use the Herald's Incense before Aviana's Egg at the Shrine of Aviana. ,"I'm convinced that YOU are the herald of Aviana, <name>. It was you who first saw her and rescued her essence from the claws of a dragon. Yes, I believe Aviana is to be reborn into our world. And you shall have the honor of ushering her over the threshold. Take this incense and burn it before Aviana 's egg in the room just above me. The ancient awaits, <name>. Our deliverance is here! "
998,Return to Aviana,Return to Aviana at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal. ,"<name>, you've done all you can here. This whole cavern is about to collapse in on itself!

999,The Strength of Tortolla,Escort a Child of Tortolla to a Nemesis Crystal. ,"The dark usurper Nemesis fled here when the fires of Hyjal receded. We are not yet strong enough to defeat Nemesis, <name>, but we may be able to turn his own strength against him. I will send a child of Tortolla with you, one of the children you freed earlier from the Twilight's corruption. Search the depths of this cave for a Nemesis Crystal, and allow the young turtle to examine it. See me if you lose your companion! "
1000,The Flameseer's Staff,Obtain 8 Bone Staff Fragments. ,A powerful artifact known as the Flameseer's Staff was lost during the initial onslaught by the enemy forces.  It was an ancient bone staff that granted its wielder power over the elements of fire. Its fragments litter the area around us.  Find them and bring them to Malfurion.  Perhaps the artifact's power will still be of use. 
1001,A New Master,"Use the Bottled Bileberry Brew on the corpse of a Twilight Inferno Lord, then speak with him. ","The potion you created is vile enough to wake the dead. Which is its intended purpose. Slay a Twilight Inferno Lord and force the brew down his throat. He will revive, if only briefly, and be completely under your dominance. Speak with him and learn the true name of the fire elemental he is channeling into the world to burn down your precious forest. "
1002,The Hatchery Must Burn,Travel through the flamegate in the center of the Flamewake in Mount Hyjal. ,"<name>! Choluna spoke true: the goddess has returned! A miracle in our midst. While you were able to kill the twilight dragon Sethria, we have not yet located all of the eggs that the harpies had delivered to her. Thisalee and I have tracked them to a great hatchery constructed within the Firelands. It is not of this realm, so Aviana cannot accompany you. Fly south and enter the flamegate in the center of the valley. Farden Talonshrike has been sent ahead and will be waiting for you within. "
1003,Slash and Burn,Ride an Emerald Drake and slay 40 Twilight's Hammer units and 5 Twilight Drakes. ,"Victory is possible, <name>. This portal is not just a means of bringing back Cenarius through the dream.  Think about it, <name>.  Once a gateway through the Emerald Dream is open, our forces can use them to move freely from Moonglade, Nordrassil, and even Wyrmrest, to this strategic location. All Ysera needs is time. It'll be up to you to keep the Twilight's Hammer forces in Darkwhisper Gorge from pulling together and attacking us from the east. Take one of the emerald drakes and hit them hard, <name>. "
1004,Mastering Puppets,Locate the Twilight Apocrypha inside of Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal. ,"<During your brief communion with the Eye, you felt that its power source lay deep within the hovel.

1005,The Eye of Twilight,Seek out the Eye of Twilight near the entrance to Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal. ,"The ogre clan across the lake is led by Gar'gol. I use the term loosely; Gar'gol has the intelligence of raw beef. So far as I can tell, Gar'gol is taking orders from a magical instrument: ""The Eye of Twilight. "" He follows its commands unquestioningly. If we can sabotage the eye, we can cause unimaginable havoc. Go to Gar'gol's hovel and seek out the Eye of Twilight near the entrance. Study it. Find a way to subvert it. Ah, marvelous chaos. . . "
1006,The Gatekeeper,Use the Horn of Cenarius to help you slay Azralon the Gatekeeper. ,"According to these tomes, one of Ragnaros' most powerful lieutenants serves as the sole gatekeeper to Sulfuron Spire. You won't be able to defeat him alone. Sound this horn when you engage in combat with Azralon and any of our forces in the vicinity will come to your aid. You must hurry, <name>.  It won't be long before the Firelord realizes what we're up to. "
1007,Lycanthoth the Corruptor,Use Lycanthoth's Incense within the Maw of Lycanthoth in Hyjal to summon and kill Lycanthoth. ,"I think I understand what's happening here. The Twilight's Hammer fears that the ancients may someday rise up to oppose them. They'll do anything to stop the return of Goldrinn. This "" Lycanthoth "" is a twisted version of our beloved wolf god, summoned by the Twilight's Hammer to replace him. Bah! It is but a shadow of Goldrinn's power. <name>, kill this beast so that the true ancient can return. Take this incense and burn it in the Maw of Lycanthoth east of here. Slay that beast and free Goldrinn! "
1008,Flamebreaker,Kill 30 Unbound Flame Spirits. ,The large elementals that besiege us are not a singular entity. They are an amalgamation of lesser spirits bound together by the Twilight's Hammer cultists' magic. The rebuilt flameseer's staff will give us enough power to shatter its bonds. Destroy the smaller elementals once you've broken up the more dangerous large ones. 
1009,"Oh, Deer! ",Rescue three Injured Fawns from The Inferno and escort them back to Mylune at the Grove of Aessina. ,"Do you speak deer? It's all in the nose. <She points to her nose. >The does have fled the fires, but their little fawns - Some of them are still trapped in the burning and the hurt! Go back into the Inferno and escort three injured fawns back here to their mothers right here beside me. Please save the little fawns, or I'll give you the big eyes! <Her eyes grow big and dewy. >"
1010,Hell's Shells,Use the Heap of Core Hound Innards near Nemesis to distract him. ,"Fresh and stinking, these innards will prove to be irresistible for Nemesis, the befouled turtle god created by Twilight's Hammer. Nemesis must eventually be destroyed, but first, we must collect a piece of his fiery armored shell. With it, we'll be able to work some magic to free the true ancient. Go into the Flamewake and drop this bait near Nemesis. It will distract him. Pry off a piece of his shell. . . then run, if you hope to survive the encounter. "
1011,Return to Nordrassil,Speak to Ysera at Nordrassil in Hyjal. ,"I will take Fandral to Moonglade swiftly.  I hope to return soon so I may continue to aid in the battle. In the meantime, report back to Ysera and inform her of these recent developments. "
1012,Secrets of the Flame,"Obtain the Ascendant's Codex, the Burning Litanies and the Tome of Flame at the Ascendant's Rise in Hyjal. ","If we are to banish Ragnaros back into the Firelands, we will need to gain access to Sulfuron Spire. Only the most trusted members of the Twilight's Hammer will have been entrusted with such valuable information. Go search the Ascendant's Rise for any written tomes you might find.  Foul as they are, we cannot waste the opportunity to learn about our enemy's weaknesses. "
1013,Flight in the Firelands,Get and equip a Twilight Firelance using the rack behind Farden. ,"<name>, our enemy is using this grotto in the Firelands to prepare an invasion. We're going to hit them hard right where they live. But first, you'll need to get your wings. Flight in the Firelands does not work as it does in the outside world. Something about the dense, superheated air. You'll need some practice! Get a Twilight Firelance from the rack behind me, equip it, then mount one of Aviana's Guardians. Practice flying - flap your wings! Visit a flag placed on the ledge below and return. "
1014,Might of the Firelord,Slay 4 Flame Ascendants and 5 Twilight Subjugators at the Ascendant's Rise in Hyjal. ,"I've been charged with leading our military operations against the enemy.  A humbling task when you consider there are demigods walking among us. I'm going to have you carry out a series of hit-and-run attacks behind enemy lines.  It will be important that you keep the enemy off guard and weaken their numbers ahead of our main force's attack. Your first target will be the Ascendant's Rise, where the most highly trained Twilight's Hammer devotees have achieved a partial elemental state. "
1015,A Bird in Hand,Extinguish a Harpy Signal Fire to get the attention of Marion Wormwing. ,"It's time to get to the bottom of this. We need to interrogate the matron of these beasts, Marion Wormwing. We'll capture her alive. Here's the plan: The harpies communicate across the ridge using a series of signal fires. If we extinguish one, Marion is sure to come investigate. You fight her as a distraction while I sneak up behind and grab her. I'll leave the questioning to you. Let's get her, <name>! "
1016,Sethria's Demise,Slay the dragon Sethria. ,"While you've been raiding Sethria 's nest, messages have been flying back and forth between here and the shrine. Skylord Omnuron was at first reluctant, but I've persuaded my fellow druids to risk a direct assault on Sethria herself. Everyone agreed to my plan. . . provided YOU spearhead the attack. Take this signal rocket and engage Sethria on the far ridge. When she reveals her true colors and shifts to her dragon form, fire the rocket and backup will arrive to help you! "
1017,End of the Supply Line,Slay 4 Twilight Proveditors at Wolf's Run in Hyjal. ,"Cho'gall's Twilight Proveditors swear a blood oath that they will get their supplies through to the front, pledging a pound of their own considerable flesh for every pound of supplies they fail to deliver. They would rather die than fail. See to it that they do both. "
1018,Speech Writing for Dummies,Kill Okrog outside the Seat of the Chosen in Hyjal. ,"Listen, <name>.  I found out what they're doing with Jarod Shadowsong.  He's scheduled to be sacrificed by the ogres of the Twilight's Hammer as part of this year's initiation. I heard that the initiate charged with delivering the speech ahead of the sacrifice is an ogre named Okrog, but get this: you were a close second. We need you to deliver that speech if we're to free Jarod.  Don't worry -- I'll write you some cue cards -- just make sure Okrog has an ""accident"" as he leaves the Seat of the Chosen. "
1019,Lightning in a Bottle,Collect a Charged Condenser Jar from a Twilight Lightning Channel. ,"Lo'Gosh granted me a vision while you were in the hovel, <name>. I saw you striding across the Lightning Ledge, with lightning bolts in your hand. The vision was powerful: Lo'Gosh feels this is of utmost importance. We must not fail the ancient.

""Investigate one of these channels, then use this totem to summon the Spirit of Lo'Gosh and learn what the ancient is planning. . . "
1020,Wave One,Equip a Twilight Firelance and fly Aviana's Guardian. ,"Here they come, <name>! The Twilight Knight Riders, astride black buzzards birthed in the scorching sulfurous breeding pools of the Firelands. The only way to defeat them is from the sky!

1021,Disrupting the Rituals,Slay 6 Twilight Inferno Lords within the Inferno. ,"The firestorms up ahead are unbound elementals in the purest form - something I didn't think could exist outside their own plane. Only very skilled summoners could unleash something like this. <name>, head into the Inferno and seek out Twilight Inferno Lords. They've got to be summoning in reinforcements as we speak. Silence them. . . For good! "
1022,Fact-Finding Mission,Report to Thisalee at the entrance to Sethria's Roost in Mount Hyjal. ,"The dragon Sethria must be stopped. We know that her roost is south of here, along the southern cliffs of Hyjal, but beyond that we know little else. I have sent Thisalee on a fact-finding mission to Sethria's Roost. She specifically requested your help - evidently you made quite an impression with the young druid. Meet Thisalee just beyond the tunnel leading to Sethria's Roost. And remember, this is a fact-finding mission - don't do anything crazy! "
1023,Lightning in a Bottle,Collect a Charged Condenser Jar from a Twilight Lightning Channel. ,"When I prayed at the shrine, Goldrinn granted me another vision. I saw you standing astride the Lightning Ledge, with lightning in your hands.

Twilight's Hammer has been running experiments with something called a ""Lightning Channel. "" Investigate these channels, then use this totem to summon the Spirit of Goldrinn and see what he has in mind. . . "
1024,Harrying the Hunters,Kill 6 Twilight Hunters at Wolf's Run in Mount Hyjal. ,"Twilight's Hammer has revealed itself as more than a mere cult. They're a war machine - a swarm of locusts moving up the mountain, devouring anything in their way. The parts of the forest they're not setting ablaze are being scoured of life in order to feed the mortal cultists. We've got to put a stop to the hunters canvassing Wolf's Run, not only to preserve what wildlife remains but to force the cult to march on empty stomachs. Look south of here, as well as up the road to the east. "
1025,Return from the Firelands,Return to Ian Duran at the Shrine of Goldrinn in Hyjal. ,I'll usher out the rest of Goldrinn's followers and seal this portal behind us.

Forgemaster Pyrendius has personally crafted many of the cursed weapons that Twilight's Hammer is using in their conquest of the realms above. Before we leave these lands of flame. . . Pyrendius must die. He will not go down easy. But, if I'm reading the tome correctly, we can briefly open up small gateways to the Abyssal Maw, the realm of water. Lure Pyrendius onto a portal rune and activate it to weaken him! "
1028,Firefight,Kill 5 Fiery Tormentors to keep them from Nordu. ,"It is. . . too late for me. Burned to all but the core. I have lived eons. . . yet still my end seems sudden. New life can spring from old. I still have wisdom to pass on. Please. . . do not let them take me before my work is done. Keep the tormentors at bay. . . just a little longer, <class>. Give me minutes, and I will give you a thousand lifetimes. "
1029,Mental Training: Speaking the Truth to Power,Use the Orb of Ascension and answer 10 answers correctly. ,"You might think you're ready to receive the knowledge we're to impart on you.  But you are not. Think of your mind as a box inside a series of other boxes. Each step of our training will open one of those boxes, until you are ready to achieve direct communion with the elements. Take the Core of Ascension and answer all questions it asks of you, truthfully.  Failing to do so could be. . . fatal. "
1030,The Voice of Goldrinn,Locate Ian Duran near the Shrine of Goldrinn in Hyjal. ,"Southwest of here lies the shrine of Goldrinn, a memorial erected in honor of the ancient wolf spirit and his contribution during the War of the Ancients. Our new worgen allies have been drawn to the memory of the wolf god - go figure! - and were in the process of cleaning up the shrine. I haven't heard anything from my contact, Ian Duran, in days. Can you fly down there and find him? I've got a bad feeling that Goldrinn's shrine is in trouble. . . "
1031,Agility Training: Run Like Hell! ,Run away from the Blazing Trainer within the Forge of Supplication for 1 minute. ,"Before we go any further, we're going to have to get you into shape. Devotion to the Old Gods is not going to save you when some emerald dragon comes chasing after you.  You need to be fleet of foot, if you catch my drift. Enough said.  We'll summon your trainer. . . your job is to run away from him without leaving this camp. Go! "
1032,The Fallen Guardian,Confront and slay Alysra at the Ruins of Lar'donir in Mount Hyjal. ,"Fandral Staghelm was kept prisoner here in Hyjal. It was the green dragon Alysra - one of my very own! - who was in charge of keeping Fandral secure. We can only conclude that the Twilight's Hammer has gotten to her. You must confront her, <name>.

1036,Howling Mad,Acquire 6 Polluted Incense. ,"The shrine has been taken, <name>. We need the tenacity of Lo'Gosh now more than ever. These defilers - the lice-ridden wolf-men running rampant over the shrine - dishonor the memory of the wolf god. They arrived with the Twilight's Hammer, howling with their own twisted religion. They seek to corrupt noble Lo'Gosh to fit their own warped pantheon. Kill them! Kill them and bring me the tools of their worship, a kind of polluted incense. I must understand what they want with the shrine. . . "
1037,Gather the Intelligence,Obtain the Twilight Communique and the Hyjal Battleplans. ,"It's me, <name>, Ortell! Don't look directly at the outhouse. . . you'll give away my position. Everything's going according to plan then?  Excellent! I'm going to need you to obtain some intelligence while you're here.

1041,Wings Over Mount Hyjal,Locate Choluna at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal. ,"<name>, is it true you're going to try to commune with the ancients? Southwest of here is the Shrine of Aviana, the matron of all flying creatures. It's the home of my favorite instructor, Choluna. I've never encountered one who was so deeply in touch with the spirits of this world. You could learn a lot from her! The recent attacks have isolated the shrine. But it's easily accessible from the air - look for the second biggest tree on Hyjal. Good luck! "
1042,Spiritual Training: Mercy is for the Weak,Slay 5 Failed Supplicants at Doom's Vigil. ,"You've made it this far.  Others haven't. Go to Doom's  Vigil, just north of here.  We've rounded up all the. . . failures.  I want you to help take care of them.  It'll be good for your spiritual growth. If this cold-blooded act gives you trouble, think of it as their second chance.  Should any of them manage to kill you. . . well, they'll take your spot. "
1043,Get Me Outta Here! ,Escort Kristoff out of Gar'gol's Hovel. ,"<You reach up to unfasten Kristoff's bonds. >Good! Make a break for the exit, and I'll follow. If we get separated, check back here to make sure I haven't been recaptured. "
1044,Cleaning House,Kill any combination of 8 Hovel Brutes or Hovel Shadowcasters within Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal. ,"Thanks to your efforts, we may soon be able to return this shrine to its former glory. But first we've got to secure this valley. South of here, a group of ogres led by Gar'gol has set up camp in a stinking hovel. I wouldn't characterize Gar'gol as a 'threat' so much as an enormous fleshy obstacle thrown into our path to distract us from the real danger. Nonetheless, he and his goons will have to be dealt with. Kill Gar'gol's minions in Goldrinn's name! "
1045,"Free Your Mind, the Rest Follows",Speak with 8 Twilight Servitors to administer the draught and rescue them. ,<Rio said that the draught would not remain effective for long. ><You'd better hurry into the hovel and administer it to as many Twilight Servitors as you can find. >
1046,Goldrinn's Ferocity,Acquire 6 Polluted Incense. ,"The beasts you see here, they're no longer my brothers from Gilneas. They've been corrupted by some kind of madness, and they've taken over the shrine. They came when the Twilight's Hammer arrived in Hyjal, and they howl the name of some blasphemous mockery of our beloved Goldrinn. Forget about me - destroy these vandals before they continue to defile the shrine. As you destroy them, look for the incense they carry and bring me some samples. "
1047,Wave Two,Equip a Twilight Firelance and fly Aviana's Guardian. ,"You've stirred up the hornets, <name>. The ceiling is coming down on us! And their strongest fighters are taking wing on creatures warped and twisted by this world of flame. Get back out there and take them down! Watch out for flaming boulders. "
1048,The Ancients are With Us,Return to Ysera at Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal. ,Nemesis. . . destroyed. I feel rejuvenated. Powerful. Awakened. Tell Ysera my strength is hers. The Twilight's Hammer will fall. 
1049,Grudge Match,Challenge Gromm'ko at the Seat of the Chosen in Hyjal. ,"I don't know if you've picked up on this, but there's a bit of a rivalry between the ogre members of the Twilight's Hammer and the rest of us. For me. . . it's personal. This one ogre called Gromm'ko has a pet raptor named ""Butcher. ""  He's taken out the last three of my corehound pups. I think this last one will fare differently.  He's got a real killer's instinct. Go to the Seat of the Chosen and challenge Gromm'ko to a match between our two beasts.  Humiliate him for me, <name>damus. "
1050,Return from the Firelands,Return to Takrik Ragehowl at the Shrine of Goldrinn in Hyjal. ,I'll usher out the rest of the followers of Lo'Gosh and seal this portal behind us.

1052,Tortolla Speaks,"Go to Tortolla, the turtle ancient, at the Ashen Lake in Mount Hyjal. ","<The Arch Druid fills the shell fragment with water, which boils instantly. He adds a bundle of herbs and closes his eyes in a silent prayer. ><name>, Tortolla the turtle ancient is ageless, a part of this world since the time of the titans. He speaks a language older than our understanding. Drink this and find a place of calm within yourself. You will be able to understand the language of Tortolla. Go to him now, in the Ashen Lake. Earn the ancient's trust. The fate of Hyjal hinges on this. "
1053,Physical Training: Forced Labor,Break 5 Darkwhisper Lodestones. ,"Training to join our ranks is not pleasant.  Why should it be? The path to serve the Old Gods is long, painful, and soul-harrowing.  Consider this your first step. Take this pick and break the lodestone deposits found in the gorge. No, we don't need any of the ore.  This is purely for your benefit. "
1054,Rage of the Wolf Ancient,Slay 12 Dark Iron Laborers. ,"Here we are deep within the realm of the fire god and what do we find? The little puppets of Ragnaros, scurrying around to do his bidding. These Dark Iron laborers are finishing and packaging the weapons Twilight's Hammer hopes to use in their conquest of Hyjal. I don't care if they're here of their own free will or if they've been brainwashed or kidnapped. . . They're a foe of our beloved wolf ancient and they should pay the ultimate price. "
1055,The Codex of Shadows,Report what you've discovered to Thisalee Crow at Sethria's Roost in Mount Hyjal. ,"<This elaborate book contains hundreds of vellum pages bound within a slate cover. It's written in many languages, most unfamiliar. Carefully inked illustrations depict sorcerers or even entire buildings vanishing into curtains of shadow. ><Many illustrations depict magical artifices like those you see around camp. You suspect the dragon Sethria is trying to keep something hidden. Thisalee will want to hear about this! >"
1056,Aviana's Legacy,Locate Choluna at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal. ,"Your expertise is needed elsewhere, <name>. Just southwest of the World Tree you will find the Shrine of Aviana, home to the Druids of the Talon. Aviana, the matron of all winged creatures, gave her life for this world ten thousand years ago.

1057,Cleaning House,Kill any combination of 8 Hovel Brutes or Hovel Shadowcasters within Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal. ,"We are well on our way to returning the shrine to its former glory, <name>. But there is some housecleaning to take care of. On the other side of this meadow, some ogre squatters are setting up camp, led by a thick-headed chunk of ugly by the name of Gar'gol. Kill Gar'gol's minions and see if we can't send him packing. "
1058,Into the Maw! ,"Step through the flamegate atop the Lightning Ledge in Mount Hyjal, and speak with Jordan Olafson within. ","Atop the Lightning Ledge, the Twilight's Hammer has erected an enormous flamegate. I do not know where it leads; I know it is not of this realm, and I cannot enter. None of my other followers have returned. I need you to enter this realm and be my fangs within. Step through the flamegate. If he is still alive, meet with Jordan Olafson inside. He will give you a token that will allow you to use my powers in that realm. Be bold, <name>. Find out where that flamegate leads, and destroy whatever lies within. "
1059,The Twilight Egg,Take the Pure Twilight Egg to Aronus at the Gates of Sothann in Hyjal. ,"The egg is unlike any that you've seen before.  Its translucent shell appears to bend the light around it. Accompanying it, you find a note describing the arrival of a fertile broodmother at the Ascendant's Rise. Perhaps you should show this to Aronus. "
1060,Fighting Fire With. . . Anything,Slay 10 Raging Firestorms within the Inferno. ,The inferno raging up ahead marks the front line between us and the forces of the Fire Lord. The fire elementals unleashed here are unlike any I've ever encountered. Can you help us stem the tide of destruction?

1061,If You're Not Against Us. . . ,Speak with Tyrus Blackhorn and convince him to help in the fight against the Twilight's Hammer. ,"South of here you'll find a solitary tower, known as ""Blackhorn's Penance. "" Upon it is bound a demon: Tyrus Blackhorn. You may think me mad for turning to an old foe for help, but Blackhorn was once a mortal, and I can't imagine he wants to watch Twilight's Hammer triumph. Speak with Blackhorn, and see if you can convince him to help us in our fight. He may yet redeem himself. . . . Just don't set him free! "
1062,Return to Alysra,Return to Alysra at the Ruins of Lar'donir in Hyjal. ,"I thank you for freeing me, <name>.  I will tell our allies of my findings. I suggest that you return to the emerald dragon that sent you. The Twilight's Hammer does not just seek to gain territory with this particular attack.  They're also after a prisoner. Fandral Staghelm is being held in the Barrow Dens.  The attack doubles as a distraction to free him.  To what end, I cannot tell.  Perhaps our dragon ally can shed some light on this. "
1063,Twilight Riot,Speak to Jarod Shadowsong at the Gates of Sothann in Hyjal. ,I thank you for freeing me.  Let us take advantage of the distraction you've created and get out of here. We must hurry before the cultists catch on. Meet me again when we've left this place. 
1064,Fresh Bait,Collect 4 heaps of Core Hound Entrails. ,"I was stunned to discover that Twilight's Hammer had located - and imprisoned - the great turtle ancient Tortolla. As we speak he is chained above the murky waters of the Ashen Lake. Freeing Tortolla from his bonds will not be easy. But we will take it one step at a time. Head into the Flamewake and collect for me heaps of core hound entrails. I will explain why later. And beware of Nemesis the Usurper while you are there! His time will come, but we are not yet prepared. "
1065,The Captured Scout,Find Scout Larandia at the Twilight Command Post in Mount Hyjal. ,"I've heard about you, <name>, and the news you brought from the south.  The battle has reached a stalemate. One that I fear is about to be broken by the Firelord's reawakening. That is unless we tip the scales in our favor in some way. There is a scout that was captured by the Twilight's Hammer.  I believe she was in possession of valuable intelligence. Find her in the Twilight camp to the west. "
1066,An Offering for Aviana,Use the Sacred Nectar at Aviana's Burial Circle. ,"Although the guardian of all winged creatures is no longer with us in body, I sometimes hear her voice in the whisper of swaying leaves. <name>, we ask much of you as you set out to preserve this mountain. Before going on, take a moment to reflect. Take this offering of nectar to Aviana's burial circle, a circle of stones just outside the main door of the shrine. Perhaps some time alone with Aviana's memory will help sharpen your focus. "
1067,The Voice of Lo'Gosh,Locate Takrik Ragehowl near the Shrine of Goldrinn in Hyjal. ,"Have you heard of Lo'Gosh, the wolf ancient? In the Alliance tongue, he is known as ""Goldrinn. ""I don't need to tell you how important the wolf god has been to the Horde - his tenacity under adversity has been an inspiration to all of our disparate races. Southwest of here, down in the valley, lies a shrine to Goldrinn. My friend Takrik Ragehowl was refurbishing the shrine when I stopped hearing from him. I fear the worst. Please find Takrik and make sure the shrine is okay! "
1068,The Return of Baron Geddon,Channel the Flameseer's Staff to weaken Baron Geddon. ,"Ragnaros is not the only powerful elemental that has re-emerged into our world. The dreaded Baron Geddon is leading the onslaught and we must put an end to this rampage. The Flameseer's Staff has proven powerful.  Perhaps it is powerful enough to weaken him to the point where our arch druids can bind him where he stands. Go, <name> and be careful.  Baron Geddon is a vengeful and treacherous being. "
1069,Rite of Wisdom,Travel to Red Rocks east of Thunder Bluff and speak with the Ancestral Spirit. ,"To gain acceptance amongst the elders of Thunder Bluff you must next complete the Rite of Wisdom. Now that you have passed the Rite of Vision, the ancestral spirits of Red Rocks will give you the blessing of our ancestors. Only those who have drunk from the Water of Seers can gain the blessing.

1070,Rite of Vision,Consume the Water of Vision in front of the tribal fire in Bloodhoof Village. ,"Again, be sure you are ready to leave Bloodhoof Village behind, <name>. The next step on your journey will take you far from here. Your path continues to lead onward, across the fields of Mulgore, the eyes of the Earth Mother on you at all times.

1071,The Ravaged Caravan,Morin Cloudstalker wants you to examine the contents of a supply crate at the Ravaged Caravan. ,"A few days ago, we found a Venture Co. caravan traveling under guard on the northern shore of Stonebull Lake. We'd lost two of our number in an earlier battle, so we were quick to attack and lay waste to the caravan. We left their supply crates, thinking that our torches would destroy anything of value, but given that Venture Co. salvagers have been spotted near the burned wagons, maybe we were wrong. Perhaps you could go to the caravan and examine the contents of the crates. "
1072,Winterhoof Cleansing,Use the Winterhoof Cleansing Totem at the Winterhoof Water Well. ,"I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well.  Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.  The well is to the southeast, but be warned: whoever did this may still be there, laying in wait. This may prove very dangerous, <name>.  Be careful. . . but do not let the defilers of our well escape. "
1073,Wildmane Cleansing,Use the Wildmane Cleansing Totem at the Wildmane Water Well. ,"Your cleansing of the Winterhoof and Thunderhorn wells is spoken among the spirits, young <name>.

Let clean water flow once again! "
1074,Preparation for Ceremony,Collect 6 Azure Feathers and 6 Bronze Feathers. ,"<name>, my brother soon stands before Chief Bloodhoof, and it is my honor to make his headdress for him. I want to ask a favor of you while I finish tanning these leather straps. There is not time for me to find enough feathers, and I was wondering, would you gather more for me? You can find feathers of the correct size from the harpies residing far to the north and northwest of Thunder Bluff. I need only 6 azure and 6 bronze feathers to complete the design. "
1075,Mazzranache,Bring a Flatland Cougar Femur to Maur Raincaller at Bloodhoof Village. ,"My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named Mazzranache. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite. As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I have gathered all the parts of the remedy I need to cure myself. . . except a flatland cougar femur. I grow weaker by the moment. . . please, help me. "
1076,Dangers of the Windfury,Bring 8 Windfury Talons to Ruul Eagletalon in Bloodhoof Village. ,"Thank you for taking the time to speak to me, <name>. I am Ruul, warrior and teacher. You have obviously reached an age when you must prepare for your trials if you are to adventure much further out of Mulgore. If you wish a test of your strength, start by seeking out the Windfury harpies to the southeast. They nestle along the mountain's edges away from the road. They are one of our natural enemies here in Mulgore and will be a good gauge of your skill. "
1077,Thunderhorn Cleansing,Use the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem at the Thunderhorn Water Well. ,"The Grimtotem are a tribe that believe all of Kalimdor should belong to the tauren alone. Their hate and anger led to a corrupting thirst for power. Magatha, their leader, poisoned our High Chieftain, Cairne Bloodhoof, and attempted to take Thunder Bluff for herself; she was defeated, and the Grimtotem exiled. Now they seek to ruin Mulgore itself as they are driven out. Quickly, <name>, you must go to the Thunderhorn Water Well in the north and perform the ritual! "
1078,Poison Water,Collect 6 Prairie Wolf Paws and 4 Plainstrider Talons. ,"Our sacred wells have been tainted, and I will need your help to fix this. To cleanse each well, I must create a cleansing totem, then you must bring the totem to the well and perform a cleansing ritual. First we will create a cleansing totem for the Winterhoof Water Well.  To do this, the land must offer its aid. Hunt prairie wolves for their paws and adult plainstriders for their talons.  They are to the southwest. Return to me with the paws and talons, <name>. "
1079,Journey into Thunder Bluff,Speak with Baine Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff. ,"The wells are cleansed, and Mulgore 's waters run sweet and clear once more. You've saved us. . . but you've also uncovered grim happenings. The actions of the Grimtotem must be made known. It is time for you to enter Thunder Bluff, our great city atop the mesa.  Go to our leader, Baine Bloodhoof, son of Cairne. He must hear of this. "
1080,Rite of Vision,Speak with Zarlman Two-Moons in Bloodhoof Village. ,"I cannot thank you enough for cleansing my tribe's well, <name>, and for fighting the savage Grimtotem to do it. But there is more to be done, and it is time for your journey to lead you beyond Bloodhoof Village. Zarlman Two-Moons stands by the fire in the north end of the village.  Go speak with him and learn of the next ritual you must undertake. "
1081,A Bundle of Hides,Bring the Bundle of Hides to the wind rider master Tak in Bloodhoof Village. ,"I have a bundle of hides from the animals of Mulgore, and must get them to Thunder Bluff.  A colleague there, Ahanu, will use the hides to create leather goods. Will you take the hides to him for me? The quickest way to Thunder Bluff is on the back of a wind rider.  Bring the bundle of hides to Tak, our wind rider master in Bloodhoof Village, and speak to him about transport to Thunder Bluff. "
1082,Ride to Thunder Bluff,"Buy a wind rider to Thunder Bluff from the wind rider master Tak, then bring the Bundle of Hides to Ahanu in Thunder Bluff. ","For a small fee, I will give you a wind rider to Thunder Bluff.  There's no faster way to the city! If that is acceptable, speak to me again when you are ready to go. If you're taking those hides to Ahanu, then I think he's at Hewa's Armory, at the base of the wind rider tower in Thunder Bluff.  And that's right where you'll land! "
1083,Wildmane Totem,Collect 4 Prairie Alpha Teeth from Prairie Wolf Alphas. ,"There is but one water well left to cleanse, named after the Wildmane clan.  For this well to be pure, the land must offer the teeth of a fierce predator, the prairie wolf alpha.  Find the alphas to the north, then return to me when your hunt is finished. Alphas often wander around the base of our mighty city, Thunder Bluff. "
1084,War Dance,Defeat Orno Grimtotem at Stonetalon Pass. ,"Some see our people as gentle giants, or noble savages. They have never seen us fight against our own kind. . . against betrayers from within. The Grimtotem were offered mercy in exile, and they have scarred their own home to spite us. They will no longer be tolerated in Mulgore. I've already sent our warriors ahead to drive them out through Stonetalon Pass, to the north. You have fought bravely against the Grimtotem, <name>; I ask that you join the battle again. Go, and help deal this final blow. "
1085,Return to Varg,"Buy a wind rider to Bloodhoof Village from the wind rider master Tal, then bring Ahanu's Leather Goods to Varg Windwhisper. ","In order to fly to a town, you must have already been there and spoken with the wind rider master of that town.

Once at Bloodhoof Village, you can then deliver the leather goods to Varg Windwhisper. "
1086,Tal the Wind Rider Master,Bring Ahanu's Leather Goods to Tal in Thunder Bluff. ,"I have prepared leather goods for Varg to sell at the Bloodhoof Village.  Will you bring them to him?

Take the leather goods to Tal, our wind rider master in Thunder Bluff, and speak with him to arrange transport to Bloodhoof Village. "
1087,Sharing the Land,Kill 15 Palemane Gnolls then return to Ahmo Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof Village. ,"<name>, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as our elders have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land. Palemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled. Words are no longer the answer. "
1088,The Restless Earth,Use the Drums of the Soothed Earth to calm 6 Agitated Earth Spirits. ,"Until recently, a group of dwarves intruded on our lands to the west, carving the earth apart senselessly to search for treasure.  When the very earth itself tore apart, the spirits of the land they had abused rose up and took their revenge. The agitated earth spirits still roam the former dig site, <name>.  We must offer them appeasement. Take this drum with you to the west and play to the spirits.  The rhythm may calm their fury and confusion. "
1089,Thunderhorn Totem,Collect 6 Stalker Claws and 6 Cougar Claws. ,"There is more work to be done.  We must create a new totem to cleanse the Thunderhorn Well.

You will find the prairie stalkers and flatland cougars to the east and west. "
1090,Morin Cloudstalker,Find Morin Cloudstalker to the east of Bloodhoof Village. ,"You may have heard of the Venture Company. They are a goblin ""cartel"", something like a tribe. While one of these cartels has joined us in the Horde, the Venture Company is loyal only to greed. These greedy goblins and their workers have tried to exploit the resources of Mulgore before, to little success. One of our outrunners, Morin Cloudstalker, has gone to check the remains of one of the goblin caravans. If you wish to help him, follow the road out of the village to the east. "
1091,The Ravaged Caravan,Return the Venture Co. ,"Prying open the lid reveals a tightly packed assortment of ore and minerals, more evidence of the Venture Co. 's mining operation in Mulgore. On the top of the ore and minerals you remove a tightly bound sheaf of papers. Up in the foothills to the east, you can barely hear the sounds of work, and see smoke rising from a large fire. "
1092,Swoop Hunting,Bring 8 Trophy Swoop Quills to Harken Windtotem in Bloodhoof Village. ,"The swoop is a cunning bird, and difficult to find and hunt.  A collection of Swoop Quills is a badge of cleverness and determination for a hunter. If you are willing to take up this task, then enter the plains and hunt the swoop. Bring me their quills, and bring honor to your clan. The swoops may be found anywhere in Mulgore, but your eyes must be sharp to spot them, and your hooves must be quick to catch them. "
1093,Winterhoof Cleansing,Use the Winterhoof Cleansing Totem at the Winterhoof Water Well. ,"I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well.  Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.  The well is to the southeast, but be warned: whoever did this may still be there, laying in wait.

1094,A Sacred Burial,Kill 8 Bristleback Interlopers at Red Rocks. ,"Only the most valiant tauren are laid to rest at Red Rocks, our sacred burial ground. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend Thunder Bluff and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their tribes and chieftains. But it appears a foul menace has made its way onto our holy land. A band of Bristleback Interlopers is ravaging the grave site and I am too old and past my prime to drive them away. They must be driven off with force, <name>. "
1095,Learn to Ride in Mulgore,Return the pamphlet to Kar Stormsinger at Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore. ,This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Kar Stormsinger. Kar can be found in Mulgore 's Bloodhoof Village. 
1096,Demon Seed,Obtain the Demon Seed. ,"Listen <name>, we can't leave quite yet. I managed to overhear their plans while they were preparing for the ritual sacrifice. They're planning to use a powerful artifact called the Demon Seed to launch a full scale attack on the Horde. They're keeping it under close guard over in that cave. If you can get your hands on the Demon Seed, we should take it to my sister Nagala. She'll know what to do with it. "
1097,Read the Manual,Assemble the Samophlange Manual. ,"Back when I was in the Tinker's Union, Boss Copperplug was the best engineer we had. He defected to the Venture Company shortly before I left, and took his greatest techniques with him. He hoarded his secrets, doling out bits and pieces of knowledge to his trusted inner circle. If he built the samophlange, then he's probably got the manual. Last I heard, he was operating right here, out of Boulder Lode mine to the northeast. Get the manual from him, and collect the pages from his followers. "
1098,Drag it Out of Them,Use the Grol'dom Net to ensnare a Razormane Pillager and drag it back to Togrik at Grol'dom Farm. ,"It is our instinct to simply lash out at our attackers, but wisdom dictates another path. We should interrogate one of these quilboar invaders and learn all we can. Take this net, <name>, and ensnare a quilboar pillager attacking our farm just west of here. Club the beast unconscious and bring him to me. "
1099,Altered Beings,Collect 6 Altered Snapjaw Shells from Snapjaws in the Stagnant Oasis. ,"It will be important to study both plant and animal life impacted by the oases and the unusual energies you've discovered. The Stagnant Oasis below us is home to a species of snapjaw turtles. Recently their population has exploded. Moreover, the once peaceful animals are growing aggressive, as I learned the hard way before trekking up here. <Jerrik holds up a bandaged finger. >I suspect they've been altered by the oases. Collect their shells and take them to Tonga at Crossroads for further study. "
1100,Love it or Limpet,Plant a Limpet Mine at the thinnest part of the hull of the Bellipotent. ,"< Gazlowe spreads the plans on the table and jabs a tiny finger aft of the ship below the waterline. >There! The hull is thinnest here, where the crankshaft meets the paddlewheel. And it's right next to the magazine! <name>, I can't be held responsible if some enterprising Horde <class> were to attach a limpet mine to that part of the hull. Not even if I supplied the mine. And paid <him/her>. Handsomely. The ship is anchored just southeast of here. . . go to it! Then radio me with this stolen gnomecorder. "
1101,Miner's Fortune,Retrieve the Cats Eye Emerald from one of the Venture Co. ,"Hey <race>, you interested in treasure? I knew that would get your attention. Word from the river dock here is that one of the miners in the Venture Company's Boulder Lode mine just northeast of here discovered an emerald the size of your fist. I know a few buyers who'd be interested in getting their hands on something like that, and I'd be willing to go half and half on its sale. You in? "
1102,Samophlange,"Close off the Fuel Control Valve, the Regulator Valve and the Main Control Valve then use the control console again. ",The three control valves are currently opened. The various readings on the control panel lead you to presume that they must be shut off before the apparatus can be shut off. 
1103,Wenikee Boltbucket,Bring the Broken and Battered Samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket. ,"I think I really put my foot into that one - it looks like I might have knocked one of the load-bearing fluxors into the spokes of the deregulator gear. We can fix this, easy. I know an expert on triple-expansion piston drives who would love to get her hands on a samophlange. Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of Mor'shan Rampart, she'll patch 'er right up. Hey, no need to walk - this gives me the perfect opportunity to test my personal people porter device! "
1104,Sludge Beast! ,Investigate the Sludge Beast's resting place and kill whatever comes out. ,"Whatever is lurking around the Sludge Fen, it doesn't appear to be human. Judging from the remains around its tracks, it's also dangerous. You decide to follow the tracks down to the bottom of the lake and look for the creature's resting place. "
1105,A Growing Problem,Bring Tonga's Eyes to Thunderhead Summit southwest of Ratchet. ,"An explosion of life from barren soil. . . My companion Jerrik has described similar events happening elsewhere in the Barrens. I shall have to see this for myself, but I cannot abandon my post. Here, <name>, I will loan you my 'eyes.

To get to the peak, follow the road east out of the Crossroads. Turn south when you reach a large stone scrawled with paintings. "
1106,Samophlange,Get the Console Key from Tinkerer Sniggles. ,"With the apparatus deactivated, the control panel can be opened up and the samophlange removed from the console. With everything else in place, all that is left is to acquire the key to unlock the console. "
1107,Flushing Out Verog,Gather 4 pieces of Centaur Intelligence from around the Stagnant Oasis. ,"Regthar Deathgate sent me here to observe the centaur activity, but the leader of this group is hard to pin down. I've discovered that his name is ""Verog the Dervish, "" but his whereabouts are a mystery. Can you help me do some digging? I know that "" Centaur Intelligence "" sounds like an oxymoron, but their camps are often littered with important communications. Search the centaur tents all around the Stagnant Oasis here and bring me back some info. "
1108,WANTED: Cap'n Garvey,Bring the head of Cap'n Garvey to Gazlowe in Ratchet. ,"WANTED! ""Cap'n"" J.

1109,Fungal Spores,Collect 5 Fungal Spores from mushrooms at the Forgotten Pools. ,"The oases of the Barrens hide a mystery. Life energy flows from their waters, invigorating the plants and beasts that drink it. Invigorating, and altering. There is a mushroom that grows near the Forgotten Pools to the northwest. Its spores hold properties that we, the apothecaries of Lordaeron, find useful. Bring me these spores and you will earn our gratitude. "
1110,The Stolen Silver,"Kill 8 Sunscale Ravagers, 4 Sunscale Scytheclaws, and locate the Stolen Silver. ",It's clear that these raptors acted alone to steal the Horde's silver. It's time to teach these beasts a lesson. 
1111,Sludge Investigation,Investigate 5 Muddy Tracks at the Sludge Fen. ,"Hey <name>, do you see this footprint? We found them all over the camp last night! Nothing's missing, but all our belongings have been. . . examined. The muddy trails lead back toward the Sludge Fen. Someone's been sniffing around, and I don't like it one bit. Can you go west to the Sludge Fen and investigate? See if you can find any more tracks just like this one! "
1112,It's Gotta be the Horn,Acquire King Reaperclaw's Horn. ,"The raptors of the Barrens are smarter than raptors in other lands. I think all those smarts are hiding in their horns! If so, then I could grind their horns into powder and use it to make ""smart drinks. "" I'll make a fortune! Here's where you come in: I want the horn from the smartest raptor around. ""King Reaperclaw"" leads a whole pack of intelligent raptors up on the bluffs north of Ratchet. Bring me his horn! And don't get ripped to ribbons like everyone else I've sent! "
1113,Southsea Freebooters,Kill 8 Southsea Cutthroats or Privateers on Fray Island. ,"Gazlowe promised me a promotion if I can help him with Ratchet's pirate issues. The problem is these new buccaneers that sailed in and took over Fray Island, south of here. They're not just after our goods - they've got grudges to settle! The other night they even went after one of our war galleons. I've got plans in the works to deal with the situation, but Gazlowe wants to see quick results. Head over to Fray Island and start lopping off some heads, will you? "
1114,To Track a Thief,The tracks lead to the east side of Thorn Hill. ,"Animal tracks surround the wreckage, tracks made by enormous curved claws. They appear to be raptor tracks. Your first instinct is that raptor-riders assaulted the caravan, but the impressions aren't deep and there are no non-animal tracks to be seen. The tracks head northeast of here toward the east side of Thorn Hill. The answer to this mystery must lie in its shadow. "
1115,Serena Bloodfeather,Slay Serena Bloodfeather and collect her head. ,"The harpies you've killed mentioned their matron, Serena Bloodfeather. Judging from their vile hatred toward the Horde, she must hold some kind of deep-seated grudge. You decide to hunt down Serena Bloodfeather and end matters once and for all. "
1116,Harpy Lieutenants,Kill 6 Witchwing Slayers in the Dry Hills of the Northern Barrens. ,"The only way to stop the harpy raiders is to destroy their chain of command. The harpies are led by fearless lieutenants, Witchwing Slayers. If the Slayers fall, the rest will follow. Go to the Dry Hills and cut down the Witchwing Slayers. Make sure they die painfully, <name>. We want those harpy wenches to know the idiocy of picking fights with the Horde. "
1117,The Baron's Demands,"If you trust him, talk to Baron Longshore to free him from his manacles. ","I'm bound fer that gallows fer sure, mate. That treasure's no good to me now. . . Unless I can use it ta buy me life. I'll make a deal with ye, <race>. Smash these manacles and I'll tell ye where me treasure's buried. Oh, me word is good, friend. I used ta be a real Baron, ye know. "
1118,Crossroads Caravan Delivery,Talk to Rocco Whipshank at Grol'dom Farm and escort his caravan all the way to the Crossroads. ,"<Rocco hands you a familiar-looking shotgun. >I took the liberty of cleaning up Halga's artillery for you. I'm sure I don't need to warn you about the kickback. Just ask me when you're ready to mount up for the Crossroads! Thork is waiting for you there. Be sure not to give him any lip. Don't stop for nothing, <name>, and if someone gets too close, just give 'em a thump with the butt-end of your gun. Do us proud! "
1119,A Captain's Vengeance,Collect 10 Theramore Medals from Theramore Marines and Deck Hands. ,"Yet another ship from my fleet has been lost to those overzealous humans from Theramore! Their new Rear Admiral has parked himself right off the coast here. He's boarding or sinking any vessel that doesn't heave-to at his whim. Travel south along the Merchant Coast to his camp. Bring me the medals of the marines and deck hands. Execute his top Lieutenants, Pyre and Buckland. Lay waste to them as they have laid waste to my fleet! "
1120,Samophlange,Access the control console at the Venture Company research site. ,"The Venture Company have a small research facility west of here, just past the Sludge Fen. I don't know very much about what they're doing, but did manage to discover that they're experimenting with something called a ""samophlange"". Now what the heck is a samophlange? Well, whatever it is, I want to examine it, so I need someone to go get it. I obtained a copy of their control system operating manual, you should be able to figure out how to disengage the samophlange from it. "
1121,Mor'shan Caravan Delivery,Defend the Mor'shan Caravan. ,"You've managed to stir the Burning Blade's nest. Our scouts report that they are gathering for an attack. You must complete the caravan's journey before they arrive. The supplies are packed, the kodos are rested, and I hope you don't mind but I made a few adjustments to your gun. If you meet up with any resistance, shoot first and ask questions later. Quickly! They come! Speak to me when you are ready to leave. "
1122,By Hook Or By Crook,Question the nearby Razormane prisoner. ,I suppose he'll come around with some cold water to the face. What do you think he'll tell us? I'll secure him inside our livestock pen behind me here. I don't think he'll stay conscious long. Find out what you can about why the quilboar are attacking our farms! I'll leave the interrogation methods up to your better judgment. 
1123,Consumed by Hatred,Collect 30 Quilboar Tusks. ,"They murdered my wife. They burned my homestead. Since that awful night I have traveled these lands, from the sun's rising till its decline, scouring the horizon for more of those monsters.

Bring me their tusks, and we will celebrate their deaths together. "
1124,Nugget Slugs,Collect 10 Nugget Slugs from buckets around the Burning Blade farm to the southwest. ,"I want to fix this samophlange, but to do that I'm going to need some supplies. I ran out of seventeen-point-five gauge nugget slugs and I'm going to need a bunch of those for the work ahead. Unfortunately, the closest place to get them is the Burning Blade farm to the southwest. The place will be heavily guarded, so be careful, but the samophlange just might be worth the risk. Search the tool buckets, then return to me when you've gathered enough nugget slugs. "
1125,Hunting the Huntress,Collect 5 Huntress Claws from Savannah Huntresses. ,"If you want to really demonstrate your bravery to me, let me send you after something that really bites. The savannah huntresses of the Barrens are as sly as they come. Tough, resourceful, quick. . . and deadly. They've been hassling our scouts recently around the outskirts of the town, especially to the northeast. Be wary as you hunt them, <name>, or you may find yourself no longer the predator, but instead the prey. "
1126,King of Centaur Mountain,"Keep Gorgal Angerscar alive as he starts some trouble with the centaur, and help him to slay Kurak. ","We were sent here to track movements of the Kolkar centaur, but after a week of watching these dirty animals scamper all around this oasis, I'm itching to give my axe a taste of their necks. What do you say, <class>? Want to cause a little havoc with me? Let's see if we can attract the attention of their strongest warrior, Kurak. "
1127,The Far Watch Offensive,"Kill 5 Razormane Defenders, 5 Razormane Thornweavers, and Kreenig Snarlsnout. ","Pigmen running amok right on the border of Durotar? Not on my watch! It is as they say, <name>: The best defense is crushing all who oppose you. One of my scouts followed the quilboar after the last caravan raid, so we know where to strike. Kreenig Snarlsnout is the mastermind behind the attacks along the river. Crush him, <class>. Defeat him and disembowel his forces so that the attacks on this camp cease. Search for a quilboar-infested cavern along the river, just south of our stables. "
1128,Ak'Zeloth,Speak with Ak'Zeloth at Far Watch Post in the Northern Barrens. ,"Since the last great war when the Burning Legion was defeated, I have searched for sources of demonic corruption in orc society.  The collar you brought me confirms my fears. It belongs to the Burning Blade. Your role in this tale is nearly complete, <name>.  Go to Far Watch Post, on the border of the Barrens to the west, and speak with my assistant, Ak'Zeloth.  Pass on to him this information. "
1129,Warchief's Command: Northern Barrens! ,Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post in the Northern Barrens. ,"All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post in the Northern Barrens.

1130,Club Foote,Get the Ship Schematics from Chief Engineer Foote at the Broken Keel Tavern in Ratchet. ,"All this new friction between the Alliance and the Horde was leading to windfall profits, until Rear Admiral Hartley sailed into MY harbor and started poking his prow into my business. He's been searching and seizing vessels flying horde colors with the goal of depriving them use of a neutral port. I'm not about to allow some fat-fingered human to cut into my profits!

1131,Mor'shan Caravan Pick-Up,Speak to Rocco Whipshank and ride north with the Mor'shan Caravan. ,"The battle in Ashenvale rages on without relent. Our forces at the Mor'shan Ramparts are in desperate need of reinforcements and supplies. We have a major shipment of medicines and food headed north, and I need a capable <class> like you to guard it. Rocco Whipshank waits for you at the road north out of the Crossroads. Let him know you are ready to accompany the caravan. "
1132,Harpy Raiders,Collect 6 Witchwing Talons from Witchwing harpies. ,"Since you're here, <class>, perhaps you can help me with a small problem. The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers. The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top. Take out Witchwing harpies of any kind in the Northwest and bring me 6 Witchwing Talons. That should be a good start. . . "
1133,In Defense of Far Watch,Kill 8 Razormane Plunderers and 3 Razormane Hunters. ,"All the quilboars are our enemies, <name>. Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others. The Razormane tribe has been attacking our supply caravans that roll through here from Orgrimmar. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us. Start just south of here, where they've been raiding our camps near the river. Seek them out, and slay them. "
1134,Waptor Twapping,"Use Kala'ma's ""Waptor Twap"" to capture 5 Wittle Waptors. ","Waptor twapping can be wough, but I've designed new waptor twaps that ewiminate much of the wisk. Set the twap on the gwound and it will scweech wike a waptor, luwing one into the twap. When a waptor steps on my waptor twap, it'll shwink down so that it's wess dangewous. It's wewwy easy! I would do it myself but wecentwy I wan acwoss King Weapercwaw. "
1135,"Mutiny, Mon! ",Use the Pirate Signal to summon Tony Two-Tusk and his crew to the Maiden's Dagger. ,"Now for my favorite part of any mutiny: the killin'! For pirates, it doesn't matter who's supposed to be in charge, only who's in control of the ships. Anchored on the east end of this island is the Maiden's Dagger, Cap'n Garvey's old flagship. He left his most trusted officer in charge: Alicia Cuthbert. Once we take her out, the ship is ours, and so's the sea. I'll get the men onto the boats. I need you to board the Dagger and blow this horn from on deck - that'll be our signal to board. Yar! "
1136,Preserving the Barrens,Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post in Northern Barrens. ,"For years, the Barrens have been the heart of the Horde presence on Kalimdor, a vital link between the orcs of Durotar and the tauren settlements in Mulgore. In the chaos of the cataclysm, floods, earthquakes, and even a quilboar invasion threaten to separate us from this vital grassland. You look ready for a challenge. Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post and ensure the route to the Barrens remains clear! Head west from nearby Razor Hill and cross the Southfury River to find him. "
1137,The Short Way Home,Take a ride on the Silver Bullet X-831. ,"Looks like your work here is done, <class>. You'd better head back to the Crossroads. Luckily for you, my Silver Bullet X-831 prototype is finished, and she's ready for a test drive. Whaddaya say you do me one last favor and take her for a little spin? One of my assistants will accompany you. Your sweet, sweet ride is waiting on the platform behind me. Just hop on when you're ready. "
1138,The Kodo's Return,Speak with Kranal Fiss at Grol'dom Farm to ensure that his missing kodo arrived safely. ,"The great beast rises slowly to its feet, the loose Barrens soil spilling from its revitalized limbs. Instinctively it trudges back toward its home at Grol'dom Farm. You'll want to check in with Kranal Fiss to make sure the kodo made it. "
1139,Who's Shroomin' Who? ,Deliver Helbrim's Research to Sashya at Ratchet in North Barrens. ,"Think of the possibilities, <name>! Fast-growing fungal delivery agents for any manner of toxins. My companions in the Undercity will want to hear about this. Here are my notes and some additional samples. If we're fast, we can catch the next ship bound for the Eastern Kingdoms. Take the road east of here and follow it to the goblin town of Ratchet. Look for the Broken Keel tavern toward the south side of town and deliver these to my associate Sashya within. "
1140,Crossroads Caravan Pickup,Speak with Halga Bloodeye at Far Watch Post to escort the next Crossroads Caravan to Grol'dom Farm. ,"<Halga grins disarmingly, holding up an enormous firearm. >Have you ever used one of these, <name>? It's a beast. Hell with a handgrip. Too heavy to use on foot, but perfect when riding at the head of a caravan. I call it my 'street sweeper. 'We need to get those supplies you've collected to the Crossroads, and I expect trouble. I'd like for you to ride shotgun. Literally! Say the word when you're ready and I'll put you at the head of our next caravan. "
1141,Find Baron Longshore,Find and speak to the notorious pirate Baron Longshore. ,"That dirty pirate Baron Longshore was the terror of these waters before the Alliance demolished his fleet and rounded up the survivors. Am I happy about it? Do I look like a bundle of joy and good cheer, <name>? Longshore raided some of my most valuable cargo before his capture. Rumor has it he buried it before he was caught. I want my goods back! Find Longshore in the Alliance camp just south of here and see if you can get him to reveal where my treasure is. "
1142,Centaur Bracers,Collect 10 Centaur Bracers from Kolkar Marauders and Stormseers. ,"The centaur leadership relies on a core of trusted, disciplined warriors to keep the others in line. If we reduce their numbers, the Kolkar will have no might with which to support their rage. And so, I have a bounty task for you. Around the Lushwater Oasis to the south, slay Kolkar Marauders and Stormseers to collect their bracers. Return when you have a heap of these trophies and the Horde will reward you well. "
1143,Grol'dom's Missing Kodo,Find a missing Grol'dom Kodo somewhere within Thorn Hill in Northern Barrens. ,"Friend, if you are traveling south to Thorn Hill, I was wondering if you could locate one of our missing kodos? Not every caravan has made it up the pass from Far Watch Post. Those Razormane brutes hijacked a pack animal yesterday morning. It may not still be alive, but if it is, we cannot afford to lose more of our livestock. "
1144,Samophlange,Return the Samophlange to Sputtervalve at Nozzlepot's Outpost in Northern Barrens. ,"Pulling open the face of the control console reveals a dense jumble of wires, tubing and other strange mechanical objects--most of which seem to serve no practical purpose. Pushing them aside and digging deeper into the console, you find the samophlange. A tug removes it from its housing. "
1145,Gazlowe's Fortune,Gazlowe wants you to dig up his buried treasure from atop the cliffs overlooking Ratchet. ,"Sink me, you were right! There's a map tattooed on the skull. That cursed Baron - he buried my treasure right under my nose. Or, above my head, anyway. The map points to a place on the bluffs over Ratchet, to the south. Follow the road west out of the city, get atop the hill, head south, then run back towards the coast and look for an enormous tree overlooking the bay. Fetch my treasure and I'll split it with you! "
1146,The Tortusk Takedown,"Kill the Razormane leader, Tortusk. ","In the wake of the chaos down south, this "" Tortusk "" brute seems to have rallied all of the Razormane refugees to his banner. Under his leadership, he's turned them into little more than brigands. There's no negotiating with his type; Tortusk must be destroyed. If our prisoner is to be believed, you'll find Tortusk southeast of here at a place called Thorn Hill. Search the bluffs where he has a commanding view of the road. Kill him, <name>, and the immediate threat should cease. "
1147,Guns. We Need Guns. ,Gather six Heavy Dwarven Rifles. ,"Now, any good mutiny is going to need serious firepower. Cap'n Garvey claimed all the best firearms for himself: A whole shipment of big, heavy dwarven flintlocks. He keeps them at his side in the other building across the island. Grab me six of those rifles and I'll distribute them to me future officers. . . "
1148,Investigate the Wreckage,Find the wrecked caravan near the road between Ratchet and Crossroads and search the area for clues. ,"Not long ago, a shipment of silver was stolen en route from here to Crossroads. It was meant as payroll to the guards, and we want that silver back. I'll ask around here for clues, but I want you to investigate the scene of the crime. Head west and look for a crashed caravan wagon just north of the road between here and Crossroads. Find out who took our silver and get it back! "
1149,Deathgate's Reinforcements,Report to Regthar Deathgate at his outpost west of the Crossroads in Northern Barrens. ,"<name>! Your reputation among the Horde grows. I've been hearing reports from both the Forgotten Pools and the Stagnant Oasis that you've been a real bane to our centaur foes. Well done, indeed. Regthar Deathgate is in charge of our operations against the centaur all over the Northern Barrens. He could use a bold <class> like yourself to bolster his forces. Report to him at his outpost along the road west of here and aid him in any way he requires. "
1150,Ammo Kerblammo,Destroy 5 Theramore Ammunition Stockpiles along the coast. ,"Hartley must've unloaded all of his ordnance along the beach. Let's pull his teeth out, <name>! Run along the shore and look for his munitions stockpiles. Light 'em up and he'll be land-locked and unarmed while the Bellipotent is repaired. I'll meet you back here in Ratchet. "
1151,Plainstrider Menace,Collect 7 Plainstrider Beaks. ,"Are you familiar with plainstriders? Useless animals. Can't fly. Gamey. Brain the size of my knuckle. Too dim to get out of the way of a moving cart. I've broken more axles thanks to their thick skulls. . . Sometimes I think the quilboar intentionally frighten flocks of them into the path of our caravans just prior to an ambush. Make me proud, <class>. Cut a swath through those filthy birds to keep the roads free, and bring me their beaks as proof. "
1152,Take it up with Tony,Talk to Tony Two-Tusk on Fray Island in Northern Barrens. ,"This pirate situation is really crimping my operation. Cap'n Garvey is attacking any vessel in sight, even the ones whose owners paid me my bogus ""protection"" money. We need to get these pirates on the take, and fast! I know just the guy, one of Garvey's Lieutenants who's open to wheeling and dealing the Dizzywig way. He's offered to arrange a little 'mutiny' for me. Once we get these guys working for us, it's all gravy, see? Talk to my boy Tony Two-Tusk on Fray Island to the south. "
1153,Conscript of the Horde,Give Kargal Battlescar at the Barrens outpost your recruitment letter. ,"Hmm, you look pretty strong. Listen, my good friend Kargal needs some new recruits for Barrens duty. I know you want to do what's right for the Horde. Well, this is your chance. Take this recruitment letter to Kargal and see if he'll sign it. "
1154,In Fungus We Trust,Plant a Fungal Culture near the Stagnant Oasis and observe the results. ,"I've cultured these unusual spores you dug up with a most magnificent cocktail of. . . reagents. . . that I'm fond of. I'm eager to see how my manipulated spores react to the waters of the Crossroads oases. The Stagnant Oasis to the southeast should provide us an uncontaminated site for our experiment. Simply plant this culture in the moist soil anywhere near the oasis, and document the results for me. Be sure to cover your mouth, <class>. <Helbrim grins disarmingly. >"
1155,Raging River Ride,Board Horton Hornblower's Riverboat northeast of Ratchet and get a riverboat ride to Nozzlepot's Outpost. ,"Enjoy your cut of the loot, <name>! I hate to share, but business is business. And that double-dealer Nozzlepot is guaranteed a 10% cut of this treasure. Can you deliver this to him at his outpost in the north? He's got a little research station upstream, along the river. If you travel just northeast of town here, Horton Hornblower can give you a free ride on one of his riverboats. Tell him I sent ya! "
1156,Samophlange Repair,Walk the Broken Samophlange over to Brak Blusterpipe within the encampment. ,"Well that didn't go as expected. I think I busted it. No need to panic, though. Do me a favor and walk this across the way to Brak here in the camp. He'll bang this sucker back into shape real quick! "
1157,Glomp is Sitting On It,Kill Glomp and grab Glomp's Booty. ,"What? Leave it to Dizzywig to expect a mutiny on the cheap. No matter, mon, we can make this work. First we need the money. Cap'n Garvey likes to hoard the loot we've been earnin', money I can use to pay off my handpicked mutineers. The treasure pile is just outside the barracks here. You'll need to take care of Cap'n Garvey's ""treasurer"" first. Now, Glomp ain't no pushover. Believe me, I tried pushing him over once. He don't budge for nothin'. "
1158,Return to Samophlanger,Take the Re-engineered Samophlange Wreckage back to Sputtervalve at Nozzlepot's Outpost. ,"Well, that didn't work. The structural integrity of the samophlange is at an all-time low. I could add some more dials to try and fix it, but. . . that might make things even worse. Look what I discovered when I blocked the release valve and blew the cover off the differential casing, though: the personal stamp of ""Boss Copperplug. ""Take this back to Sputtervalve and tell him to find this Copperplug genius. When you're done here, just talk to me and I'll send you back using Brak's teleporter. "
1159,The Zhevra,Slay Zhevra Runners to collect 4 Zhevra Hooves. ,"If you wish to serve my beloved horde, you'll have to prove your strength to me, pup. You can cut your teeth by hunting zhevra. They may not be the strongest of beasts in the Barrens, but stay clear of their kick or you'll regret it. Hunt the zhevra to the north and south, and collect their hooves.  Bring them to me and perhaps we'll next send you against something tougher. "
1162,Competition Schmompetition,Recover 6 of Sputtervalve's Blueprints from Venture Co. ,"I'm just a little guy, trying to set up my own independent business. Working hard toward the Azerothian dream, ya know? Well soon as I set up shop, the Venture Co. next door decided they wanted me out. They've been harrassing me with threatening letters, using words like 'cease' and 'desist. 'Worst of all, the schematics for my newest machine are missing, and I know those corporate pilferers stole them! Go to the Sludge Fen and knock out some of their employees. I know they're hiding my blueprints! "
1163,Through Fire and Flames,Break the chains to free the wolves from the burning stables. ,"Help me, <class>! Piggy men come burn stables - fire! Fire! < Dorak wails incoherently before you can settle him down. >Wolves still chained inside. Someone's got to save the wee wolves! "
1164,Animal Services,Gather 5 sacks of Stolen Grain from the Razormane camps on Thorn Hill. ,"Kodos are resilient creatures. With some food, the big guy may come around. The Razormane have stolen plenty of grain from previous caravans. You can gather up stolen grain from the nearby camps. "
1165,A Most Unusual Map,Get the Tattooed Head from the entrance to the Alliance compound. ,"Here's the deal, mate: to protect me treasure map, I tattooed it onto me first mate's scalp. Of course, he's dead now, along with most of me crew. The Alliance doesn't even know what they have - his severed head is hanging from a tree at the entrance to this camp. Grab that head and take it to Gazlowe back in Ratchet. "
1166,Report to Thork,Report to Thork at the Crossroads in the Northern Barrens. ,"Now that the threat here has been stilled, you should return to the Crossroads. Thork would like to speak to you. Farewell, friend. "
1167,Hyena Extermination,Kill 6 Hecklefang Hyenas. ,"Hey <name>, we've got a real problem here. There's an overpopulation of hyenas just west of the Sludge Fen, and they're starting to become a menace. If I have to listen to them caterwauling one more night, I just might go crazy! Vernon over there says the hyenas might even have made off with one of his stabled pigs. We can't have that happening. Can you go thin out the hyena numbers? You'll find them parading in broad daylight to the west. "
1168,Mor'shan Caravan Rescue,Rescue Balgor Whipshank. ,"They took Balgor and the caravan supplies from our very doorstep! Those supplies are vital for our victory against the Alliance in Ashenvale, and Balgor. . . if anything happens to my dear little brother, I will rip every Burning Blade member to shreds myself. <name>, I need you to rescue Balgor and the captured caravan. Follow the path just north of us, up onto Dreadmist Peak. Do not let any of those Burning Blade dogs live. "
1169,A Burning Threat,Kill 8 members of the Burning Blade at the farm to the southwest. ,"While we cast our eyes toward the cataclysm, who watches our backs? While our leaders take up arms against Deathwing, the Burning Blade plots our downfall. Even as we speak, they are gathering recruits and supplies at the farm to the southwest. I care not to meet death at the hands of the Burning Legion. It's time we take matters into our own hands. <name>, will you help me keep the vigil? Go and slaughter their ranks before it's too late. "
1170,The Grol'dom Militia,Slay 6 Razormane Pillagers. ,"They came out of nowhere, <class>! Quilboar from horizon to horizon. Spines and snouts and teeth. We fell back to the farm but they kept on coming. Our best defenders have fallen in the field, and we've no sign of Farmer Ralton. I need you to go on the offensive for me! Hold these swine at bay while I defend the wounded until help arrives. "
1171,A Little Diversion,Kill 8 Kolkar Centaur. ,"I was sent here to scout out the centaur activity. I've been trackin' their every movement for days! It's time for me ta sneak out, but they've got this oasis surrounded. You look like a dangerous one. Can you make a lot of noise for me? Stir 'em up! Start killin' indiscriminately. While they're looking out for you I'll slip out to get my info to Regthar Deathgate. "

Seek out Tarindrella in the Shadowthread cave to the north. It is dangerous, but we will be prepared with this antidote just in case. "
1254,Vile Touch,Kill Githyiss the Vile at the northen end of the Shadowthread Cave. ,"If these spiders are born with corruption in their veins, then their broodmother must be at the root of this evil. Let us make our way to the far north end of the cave and seek out Githyiss the Vile. The answers we seek lie with her. "
1255,Fel Moss Corruption,Collect 6 Fel Moss from the grellkin to the west of Ilthalaine. ,"You seem to know what you're doing. Perhaps I can task you with something a little more important. As you may well know, the corruption in Teldrassil was supposedly wiped away. Yet something lingers. The creatures have not calmed and all manner of problems still plague us. I need you to deal with the grellkin that have gathered to the west, and while you're there, I want you to search them for fel moss. This will help me determine from where this continuing corruption stems. "
1256,Teldrassil: Passing Awareness,Bring the Partially Filled Vessel to Corithras Moonrage in Dolanaar. ,"While there is more I could speak to you of the moonwells and of Teldrassil, I must send you along. Corithras Moonrage will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him. Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in Dolanaar. Follow the road south from Aldrassil out of Shadowglen, and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west. Mind you stay on the road though, <name>. There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late. "
1257,Iverron's Antidote,Collect 7 Moonpetal Lilies. ,"Our friend Iverron has fallen to poison from the nearby webwood spiders. I can tend to him to keep his state from deteriorating, but I need someone to gather an ingredient to prepare him an antidote. All around the ponds you should find Moonpetal Lilies. These flowers have great healing properties, and I can use them with the ingredients I already have to restore Iverron to better health. Would you gather them for me?  There should be many just in sight of here, near the water's edge. "
1258,Demonic Thieves,Recover Melithar's Stolen Bags near the grellkin to the west. ,"Vicious little grell! They've been stealing from our foodstores again. If you wouldn't mind lending a hand, they are sure to have my stolen bags within their camps to the west. I would be glad to reward you if you can bring them back to me. "
1259,A Favor for Melithar,Speak to Melithar Staghelm in Shadowglen. ,You should speak with Melithar. I believe he had some troubles with the grell already. I expect he can offer you a well needed place to store more of your goods should you aid him. 
1260,Precious Waters,Bring the filled crystal phial to Tenaron Stormgrip at the top of Aldrassil in Shadowglen. ,"Tenaron Stormgrip oversees all that happens in this glade. He presides at the top of Aldrassil. If you look to your south, you will see the underside of the ramp that leads up to him. Ascend this ramp and complete your training. It was wonderful to have met you, <name>. I swell with pride knowing that among young night elves, there are some so selfless and full of life as you are. You will do great things for our people. You will do great things for this world. Until we meet again. "
1261,Signs of Things to Come,Speak to Dentaria Silverglade between the pools in northern Shadowglen. ,"I will pursue the trail of the Gnarlpine and track this corruption to its source. If you ever encounter Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar, he knows intimately of the problems that plague this forest, and he can direct you on how to help further. I'm sure we will meet again with time. Perhaps you can aid me in dealing with the source of this corruption once I locate it. For now, I will take you back to Dentaria so that you may finish your training. Thank you for all that you have done, <name>. "
1262,Webwood Corruption,Kill 12 Webwood Spiders. ,"I'd hoped to never return to Teldrassil for such grim business. I'd hoped that its corruption had been wiped away completely.  Something foul lingers. These spiders suffer much more deeply from the corruption than the other nearby wildlife. They are becoming a danger to your people and a danger to the forest. We must thin their numbers, but more importantly, we need to find the source of the corruption that plagues them. I will come with you and aid you in this. "
1263,Into The Maw of Madness,Commander Mar'alith at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to find his beloved Natalia. ,"I need you to venture into Hive'Regal and find what became of my dearest Natalia, <name>. This will be no easy task for you. Before you dive headlong into the maw of madness, make sure that you speak with those dwarves further. They might be able to give you some tips on dealing with the silithid that inhabit that hive. And <name>, if she truly is as mad as they say. . . do what you must. "
1264,True Believers,Hermit Ortell wants you to bring him 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts. ,"Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you. My former organization has a secret encoded bulletin they circulate on a monthly basis. If they make any progress searching for me or if they call off the search, word will be published on the True Believer. Although this information is obviously valuable to me, the publication contains other useful information that I can share.  Bring me any encoded texts you find on Twilight's Hammer members. "
1265,Glyph Chasing,Use the Geologist's Transcription Kit to make a Hive'Regal Rubbing from the Hive'Regal Glyphed Crystal. ,"After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals. If I can get rubbings of those crystals and the glyphs on them, we might be able to make sense of this madness. Take this transcription set  and hit Hive'Regal to the east, <name>. That's the last rubbing I need! "
1266,Encrypted Twilight Texts,Keep bringing me texts. ,Excellent work!  I'll put a good word in for you. 
1267,The Sands of Silithus,Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus. ,"Let's see. . . oh, here's a good one! Silithus! So, apparently the Cenarion Circle needs assistance with an insect infestation of some sort. <Vizzie shivers. >Ugh! No thanks, not for me. I'm perfectly happy freezing to death here in Everlook if the alternative is bugs. Hmm. . . it says here that visitors should speak with Windcaller Proudhorn, and the easiest way to get there is via the path up Un'Goro Crater's northwestern cliffs. You interested? "
1270,Still Believing,"Find any more encrypted texts? &nbsp; Bring me a good batch of them, this decoding work takes some time. ",Excellent!  I can't wait to read these.  Please do keep bringing the encrypted texts here if you find them. 
1271,Azeroth's Tear,What do ye have there? A level 10 Silithus Quest. ,"By the forge! What ye got there is. . . truly somethin'. A shard of concentrated agony. . . our world's torment given form. It hurts me tae even look at it. Yet within all that sadness, there is power, too. We can use its energy to help heal the wound. Maybe even bring Azeroth some solace. Thank ye for bringin' it to me, <name>. "
1272,Vyral the Vile,Slay Vyral the Vile and obtain Vyral's Signet Ring. ,"We have discovered another base of operations for the Twilight's Hammer.  It is called Twilight's Run; it is a cave tucked in the northeast corner of Silithus.  The local leader of the cult, Vyral the Vile, haunts that cave - it is he who you must next defeat.  When you have done this, bring me his signet ring. Fortune to you, <name>.  The horrors of Twilight's Run are formidable indeed. "
1273,The Twilight Lexicon,Bring the three chapters of the Twilight Lexicon to Hermit Ortell in Silithus. ,"The Twilight's Hammer are not kind to those that leave their ranks.  They hunt me to this day like I'm some sort of beast!  Needless to say, an enemy of theirs is a friend of mine! To decipher this Tablet I'll need the book used by their scribes to encode secret messages: the Twilight Lexicon.  It's such an important tool that they keep its three chapters in different locations!  The officers entrusted with the Lexicon are known as Twilight Keepers.  Look for them at the Twilight's Hammer camps. "
1274,Warchief's Command: Silithus! ,Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus. ,"All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold. You are to aid our Cenarion allies in their battle to turn back Twilight's Hammer. Cho'Gall's minions must not be allowed to dominate Silithus! You can reach Silithus by taking the northwestern road out of Un'Goro Crater. Or, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! "
1275,A Terrible Purpose,Take the Decoded Tablet Parchment to Commander Mar'alith. ,"Ok, here we are. . . a pretty valuable chunk of information, I must say!  I've seen the Cenarion Circle forces arrive at Silithus.  They plan to drive the Twilight's Hammer out, don't they?  This will help. Take this parchment to their leader, Commander Mar'alith.  Soon the Twilight's Hammer will be vanquished and I will be outside their grasp for good! "
1276,Secret Communication,Bring 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts to Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold. ,"Some of the Twilight's Hammer cultists carry around little papers with gibberish written on them.  I want you to bring me a stack of them, <class>. I can't figure out what the gibberish means, but that's not the point!  These papers are how their different groups communicate secretly.  The more texts we take out of circulation, the less they can communicate! "
1277,"Wanted - Deathclasp, Terror of the Sands","Bring Deathclasp's Pincer to Vish Kozus, Captain of the Guard. ","The terrible scorpid, Deathclasp, is believed to have retreated to the southern mountain range in the presence of increased silithid activity.  She presents a great threat to patrols and expeditions in the southern regions.  Individuals participating in her destruction will be remunerated handsomely.  Inquire with Captain Vish Kozus, at the top of the Cenarion Hold Watchtower, regarding a reward. "
1278,Twilight Geolords,"Kill 10 Twilight Geolords, then return to Huum Wildmane in Cenarion Hold. ","The Twilight's Hammer, an insane cult bent on destruction, set up camps in Silithus and perform rituals day and night.  We do not yet know their plans, but we do think they are somehow linked to the pulsing red crystals spread across the desert. Although their mystery may one day be solved, we must first deal with their immediate threat.  Go to their camps to the west and seek out Twilight geolords.  They are the heads of these serpents; that is where we must strike! "
1279,Unraveling the Mystery,Deliver the Glyphed Crystal Prism to Geologist Larksbane at the Cenarion Hold in Silithus. ,"We're on the verge of a breakthrough, <name>! The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid. Unfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals. Take the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold.  She might be able to help. "
1280,The Twilight Mystery,Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to collect 8 Twilight Tablet Fragments. ,"A camp of Twilight's Hammer cultists once thrived northwest of here.  If you were to venture there now, you'd find the area swarming with elementals and nothing but scattered pieces of wood and canvas to mark the spot where the camp was. I've recovered a few fragments of a clay tablet from the site, but I have too few of them to piece together anything useful.  See if you can find the remaining tablet fragments so we can shed some light into the Twilight's Hammer presence here in Silithus. "
1281,Dearest Natalia,Question Frankal and Rutgar at Bronzebeard's Encampment about the whereabouts of Natalia Mar'alith. ,"My dear Natalia has gone missing. Truth be told, she had been acting strangely for weeks leading up to her disappearance. I had caught her talking to herself when no one was around on more than one occasion. She was adamant that everything was ok and that she must be allowed to continue her research. She was last seen heading to Bronzebeard's camp to the south. My soldiers are spread too thin, <name>. I need you to go to Bronzebeard's camp and question those dwarves. "
1282,The Deserter,Take the restored tablet to Hermit Ortell in Silithus. ,"There are rumors of a Twilight's Hammer member called Ortell having deserted his sect.  Word has it he hid in the mountains south of Southwind Village, where he lives as a hermit.  Perhaps you can enlist his help in deciphering the tablet. Take the restored tablet with you and seek out Ortell. "
1283,Securing the Supply Lines,Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to kill 15 Dredge Strikers. ,"Cenarion Hold is a location of utmost strategic importance.  I'm convinced that while we hold it our victory over the silithid is guaranteed.  Provided our influx supplies can be maintained, that is. Desert worms have proven to be more of a threat to our supply caravans than even the silithid themselves.  Just this morning, a large shipment of morrowgrain was ravaged by a group of dredge strikers.  I need you to thin their numbers to ensure our supplies aren't jeopardized. "
1284,Noggle's Last Hope,"Beetix Ficklespragg at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to gather 3 Stonelash Pincer Stingers, 3 Stonelash Flayer Stingers and 3 Rock Stalker Fangs. ","Blasted!  The antidote didn't work.  Noggle must've been stung by one of the stronger creatures in the far south. I'm going to need you to go there and get me some more samples, <name>.  The good news is that since their poison is stronger I won't require as many.  The bad news is that there are more kinds of poisonous creatures crawling around the southern area so you'll have to draw from more sources. "
1286,The Dunes of Silithus,Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus. ,"Cenarion Hold, in Silithus, is one of the biggest druid settlements in Kalimdor. Almost as big as Moonglade, mon. Someday, maybe Zen'Aliri be headin' on over to Cenarion Hold. . . fightin' some Twilight's Hammer, healin' the land where the silithid tear it. . . but Zen'Aliri 's master tells him to wait. So Zen'Aliri waits. The easiest way to get there is that path up Un'Goro Crater's northwestern cliffs. If you got no master. . . there's nothing keepin' you from movin' on. "
1287,Noggle's Lost Satchel,Retrieve Noggle's Satchel from the mountains in the south of Silithus and return it to him at Cenarion Hold. ,"Where am I?  Where's my bag? *gasp* I must've lost it while fleeing from Deathclasp, the giant scorpid.  In my rush to escape I walked right into a nest of stonelash flayers. The satchel I was carrying had all sorts of rare reagents in it.  Without them, me and Beetix won't be able to make the potions that Cenarion Hold needs.  I'm too weak to get up yet, but I can make it worth your while if you bring back my reagents. I ran into Deathclasp in the southern mountain range, behind Bronzebeard's camp. "
1288,Brann Bronzebeard's Lost Letter,Take Brann Bronzebeard's Letter to Bronzebeard's Encampment in southern Silithus. ,"To Whom It May Concern: If you're reading this, I'm either dead or soon to be dead. It's hard to say. Most of the crew is dead anyhow. Found information about a Titan. Great battle between him and an Old God. Yes, a bona fide Old God. Found ancient tunnel leading to Ahn'Qiraj. Taking it. Take this letter to my old camp. Make sure my monkey is getting adequate food, water, and hugs. -Brann Bronzebeard, Explorer ExtremeP. S. Watch out for crazy Old God worshipping night elf. "

1291,Breaking the Code,Obtain an intact Hive'Regal Silithid Brain from any silithid in Hive'Regal. ,I think I can formulate an elixir that will allow us to more readily decipher the glyphs and language of the silithid and Qiraji! What do I need? Glad you asked! I need brains! Normally I'd need a brain from each silithid type that inhabit the hives. Another brave explorer brought me two of 'em here. . . and never came back from Hive'Regal. Bring me back a silithid brain from Hive'Regal. . . and be careful not to end up like him! 
1292,Call of the Scarab,Report to Field Marshal Snowfall in Silithus. ,The Call of the Scarab event is occurring today. Speak with your faction's leader near the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj. 
1293,Report to Marshal Bluewall,Speak with Marshal Bluewall at the Alliance encampment near Hive'Zora. ,"Are you Marshal Bluewall 's new recruits? Of course you are. What are you waiting for? Good soldiers are dying in the desert. Aren't you excited to join them? Now, get going and don't dry out on the way. "
1295,Lean Shanks,"We need meat, and lots of it. ",You make your Warchief proud. For da Horde! 
1296,Cinder of Cynders,Bring the Cinder of Cynders to Warlord Gorchuk in Silithus. ,The cinder seethes with the hatred that its former owner held for you. 
1297,Call of the Scarab,Report to Warlord Gorchuk in Silithus. ,The Call of the Scarab event is occurring today. Speak with your faction's leader near the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj. 
1299,Coreforged Sigil of Skaldrenox,Bring the Coreforged Sigil of Skaldrenox to Warlord Gorchuk in Silithus. ,The sigils of the Abyssal High Council are crafted from the distilled essence of the element of their holder. This sigil was forged in flame. 
1300,Chilled Meat,"De beasts of Northrend are big, heavy, and full of meat. ","This will work just fine. De Horde thanks you, bruddah. "
1301,Stepping Up Security,Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to slay 20 Dredge Crushers. ,"Your performance has been truly exemplary so far, <name>.  Our supply lines are not completely safe yet, however.  In the absence of dredge strikers, their larger southern cousins will surely move in to take their place in the north. You'll have to kill quite a few dredge crushers to keep them at bay, but we cannot leave the safety of our supply lines to chance. "
1302,Chilled Meat,"The beasts of Northrend are big, heavy, and full of meat. ",This will work just fine. The Alliance thanks you. 
1303,Pearl of Fathoms,Bring the Pearl of Fathoms to Warlord Gorchuk in Silithus. ,"The pearl is immaculately smooth, and surprisingly dense. "
1305,Diamondine Sigil of Kazum,Bring the Diamondine Sigil of Kazum to Warlord Gorchuk in Silithus. ,"The sigils of the Abyssal High Council are crafted from the distilled essence of the element of their holder. This sigil was carved from stone, then fused into a faultless diamond. "
1307,Deadly Desert Venom,Beetix Ficklespragg at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to gather 8 Stonelash Scorpid Stingers and 8 Sand Skitterer Fangs. ,"Beetix Ficklespragg at your service!  My cousin Noggle makes a living gathering rare herbs for Cenarion Hold alchemists.  Or used to, anyway.  He came back from his last trip with a strong poison running though his veins. I've managed to slow down the venom, but to fully neutralize it I need poison samples from whatever stung him. Noggle arrived from the north, so I'd bet my shirt stonelash scorpids or sand skitterers did it.  Bring me some stingers and fangs and I'll try to make an antidote for him. "
1308,Sandworm Meat,Convincing the giant colossi of Silithus to wake up requires a whole heap of meat. ,"Many thanks, friend. For the Alliance! "
1310,Lean Shanks,"We need meat, and lots of it. ",You make your King proud. For the Alliance!

1313,Hero's Call: Silithus! ,Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold.

For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
1314,Glimmering Sigil of Whirlaxis,Bring the Glimmering Sigil of Whirlaxis to Field Marshal Snowfall in Silithus. ,The sigils of the Abyssal High Council are crafted from the distilled essence of the element of their holder. This sigil was carved with biting winds.

1317,Coreforged Sigil of Skaldrenox,Bring the Coreforged Sigil of Skaldrenox to Field Marshal Snowfall in Silithus. ,The sigils of the Abyssal High Council are crafted from the distilled essence of the element of their holder. This sigil was forged in flame. 
1318,Report to General Kirika,Speak with General Kirika at the Horde encampment near Hive'Regal. ,"You must be one of General Kirika 's new recruits. It's about time you showed up. Bodies wear down quick in the desert. The dwarves have been getting reinforcements daily, and we can't afford to lose ground in our struggle for resources in Silithus. Get your instructions from the General. It's not my job to train you, just find you. "
1320,Tidal Sigil of Skwol,Bring the Tidal Sigil of Skwol to Warlord Gorchuk in Silithus. ,The sigils of the Abyssal High Council are crafted from the distilled essence of the element of their holder. This sigil was crafted from coral and smoothed by the tides.

1331,Raw Clefthoof Meat,Gorchuk tells me that the old orc clans of Draenor used to prize the clefthoof for its size - one kill could feed a village for a night. ,"Look at that mountain of meat. You done de Horde proud, <name>. "
1332,Raw Clefthoof Meat,I remember reading that the old orc clans of Draenor used to prize the clefthoof for its size - one kill could feed a village for a night. ,"Look at that mountain of meat. You have done the Alliance proud, <name>. "
1333,Pearl of Fathoms,Bring the Pearl of Fathoms to Field Marshal Snowfall in Silithus. ,"The pearl is immaculately smooth, and surprisingly dense. "
1334,Adder Subtraction,Collect 5 Enervated Adders. ,"The corruption unleashed here must be studied if we're to find a way of properly fighting it. Luckily, not all the creatures have been as altered as others. The smaller snakes drink little water, and do not eat plants, so their exposure to the energies here has been minimal. They've still absorbed enough to change coloration. Go collect these snakes from the overgrowth and return them to me, so we can see just what is happening to the creatures here. "
1335,Clap 'Em In Irons,Speak to the Taurajo Looters in the Taurajo Ruins and place them under arrest. ,"Our policy of conscripting non-violent criminals from the Stormwind Stockades has come back to haunt us, <name>. Some of my less-scrupulous soldiers broke ranks after our victory in Taurajo and are looting the remains of the city. This is a breakdown in discipline. Worse, the desecration of their homes only spurs the enemy to fight harder when our ultimate goal should be peace. Take these manacles and bring the Taurajo looters to justice. Speak to them first, but you may need force to subdue them. "
1336,The Butcher of Taurajo,"Speak with Karthog, then lure out and assassinate General Hawthorne. ","This operative had orders to secure the roadways between the Alliance command and Fort Triumph. General Hawthorne is on the move. <Bloodhilt crumples the documents in his fist. >It's HIM, <name>! Hawthorne - I spit the name - he is the one who ordered the assault on Taurajo! Now we know when and where to strike him down. Quickly, follow the road north of the Battlescar and meet up with my assassin Karthog. CRUSH Hawthorne and string his body up along the road! "
1337,Feegly the Exiled,Kill Feegly the Exiled in the Bael Modan Digsite. ,"Saddest story I ever heard told, <name>. Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. ""The Tear of the Moons"" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried. Feegly was banished from Bael Modan but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery. "
1338,Digsite Status,Locate Marley Twinbraid outside the Bael Modan Excavation in Southern Barrens. ,"The patrol's been quiet today. And that's got me worried, <name>. Ever since the Alliance sacked Taurajo, none of our positions are secure. You look like you can handle yourself - can you scout around for me? Check in with my son Marley outside the Bael Modan excavation, southeast of here. The site's exposed and susceptible to raids, and my son's too proud to signal for help if he needs it. "
1339,Sabotage! ,Sabotage a Dwarven Artillery Shell and then flee from Bael'Dun before it explodes. ,"These dwarven artillery shells have a built-in airburst timer. This is easy! Just sabotage one of the artillery shells in the loading bay and then hoist it up into the magazine. Boom, baby. BOOM! You'll find the shells in one of two loading bays behind the main garage on this level. It's right around the corner. Once you've rigged the artillery shell. . . Run! Run like the wind, <name>! Then report to Gann back at camp. I'll be right behind you. "
1340,Blood of the Barrens,Collect 6 Blood Shard Trinkets from Razormane Quilboar. ,"This bright red stone, found clutched in the grasp of a quilboar, has been carefully carved into the likeness of a great boar, with thorny vines sprouting from its back. Its surface is smooth and worn with care. Did the quilboar make this? If you find others, maybe one of the shaman at Firestone Point could tell you more about them. "
1341,The Guns of Northwatch,Speak with Cannoneer Smythe. ,Captain Fisher signaled us from below. The Horde fleet is landing shore parties? We can't let them flank us from the beach. I've already sent two of my best gunners down there to defend the beach head. Talk to Cannoneer Smythe down on the shore. You'll have to fight your way through the courtyard to get there. See if you can help the others secure the hold on your way down! 
1342,Smarts-is-Smarts,Kill a Triumph Captain on the far side of the Battlescar and acquire a Fresh Brain. ,"My monstrosity is taking shape! All that's left is to stuff his skull with something useful. I'm talking about brains, <name>. And here I'm going to be picky. The abomification process causes significant brain damage so it's best to start with someone smart. One of the Alliance officers should do nicely. Seek out one of the Captains on the far side of the Battlescar and try not to damage the goods while you kill him. "
1343,Silithissues,Use the Bucket of Burning Pitch on Silithid Mounds and kill 10 Silithid Swarmers as they emerge. ,"The silithid! They're bugs, <name>. Or something like bugs. They're not natural. . . and we built a fortress on the equivalent of an anthill. Take this burning pitch. It'll set the buggers on fire and plug up their burrows at the same time. Be careful when you pour this stuff on there - the silithid will come out in swarms! Look for silithid mounds around the exterior of Desolation Hold. They look like heaps of sand. Kill anything that crawls out. "
1344,Claim the Battlescar,Go to the Battlescar. ,"The Horde has fought us to a standstill from their stronghold west of here. The fighting continues, even as the land breaks open under our feet. Someone's got to break the stalemate! I need you to venture into the Battlescar and help my men crush the Horde opposition there. In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls the area. Scout out the flag. It'll be worth your while to claim the scar for the Alliance if someone hasn't already done so. "
1345,Bael'dun Rescue,Go into Bael'dun Keep and rescue 10 Bael'dun Survivors from the rubble. ,"Help - Help! You've got to do something! Some dwarves are still inside - so many - they're trapped in the debris. Buried alive. The flames! It's a nightmare in there. We don't know how much longer until the roof collapses. . . Please, <class>, you've got to save them! Run inside. Use the emergency fire valves to protect yourself from the flames. You're the only hope they have. . . "
1346,Running the Gauntlet,Kill 8 Hunter Hill Scouts. ,"Look around you, <class>. We've had no luck dislodging the Horde from the hidden trails that overlook this valley. They appear out of nowhere to ambush our supply caravans and then disappear into the hills! I need you to run the gauntlet to Honor's Stand and let them know the roads still aren't safe. Talk to Mattingly, the supplies officer by the gate. And kill a few of these brutes along the way! "
1347,A Line in the Dirt,Capture a neutral hill in the Fields of Blood and defend it against an Alliance counterattack. ,"The Alliance scorches a trail of murder across the Barrens. We must stop them here or there is nothing left for us. Across the Fields of Blood there are a number of strategic hills, marked by wooden towers and neutral gray banners. We must take and hold these hills if we hope to slow the Alliance advance! Look for the towers to the north, east, and south of what's left of Taurajo. Claim a neutral flag and defend the hill against counterattack! "
1348,Hero's Call: Southern Barrens! ,Report to Dockmaster Lewis at the docks outside Northwatch Hold in the Southern Barrens. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Dockmaster Lewis near Northwatch Hold. Our brave soldiers have made tremendous gains in the Barrens, but they have paid a heavy price! Your efforts are needed to consolidate our gains. You can reach the docks outside Northwatch Hold by taking a boat from Booty Bay to Ratchet and traveling south along the coast. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
1349,Dwarf Fortress,Acquire the Bael'Dun Fortress Schematics. ,"I don't know if you noticed on your way in, but this whole fortress is erected around a giant cannon. If we can just find the ammunition magazine, we could blow this place sky-high as easy as kiss-my-hand! But to figure it out I'm going to need the fortress schematics, and I haven't been able to steal them yet. Look for the plans on the lowest floor, right down these stairs. "
1350,Scavenged,Retrieve 10 Northwatch Supply Crates from the Raptor Den. ,"<You discover a cargo manifest on the body, detailing a long list of sundries urgently needed on the front. ><A bloody trail in the dirt indicates bodies were dragged south of here, toward the raptor dens. ><The raptors may have dragged away the supplies, as well. Retrieving those supplies for Corporal Teegan could help salvage this disaster! >"
1351,Changing of the Gar'dul,"Go to the top of the northern tower in Desolation Hold and help Warlord Bloodhilt ""Relieve"" Gar'dul of command. ","When Bloodhilt arrives, I'd like to - ah - talk in private. Can you accompany me to make sure things stay on the level? This Bloodhilt is a, ah, he's a, he's a loose cannon. <Gar'dul tries to compose himself. >Meet me atop the northern tower and we'll talk with Bloodhilt together. "
1352,Parts-is-Parts,Use Calder's Bonesaw on corpses within the Battlescar and collect 15 Severed Extremities. ,"I've always wanted to try making an abomination. It looks simple enough, but you know how it is when you learn things from a book. There's no substitute for doing! First, I'm going to need parts. Lots of parts. And you're going to get them for me. No need to be picky: human, orc. . . it doesn't matter. Parts is parts. Just be sure the corpses you harvest come from the Battlescar, so I know they're fresh. <Calder presses a rusted, gore-covered bonesaw into your hands and smiles disarmingly. >"
1353,Flightmare,Use Tomusa's Hook on Triumph War Gryphons to dismount and kill 5 Wildhammer Mercenaries. ,"The Alliance has hired in Wildhammer mercenaries to control the skies over the Battlescar. I believe these same gryphon-riders were the ones to firebomb Taurajo during the attack. I want our skies scoured clean. The wildhammer dwarves fly low enough for a sharp-eyed <class> to hook them. Take this. Target their gryphons and dismount the riders - once grounded, show them no mercy. "
1354,Kill 'em All! ,Kill 10 Frazzlecraz Miners at the Frazzlecraz Motherlode in Southern Barrens. ,"I want to see some dead goblins, <name>! Just west of here you'll find a whole warren of those little insects burrowing into the mountain. Let's see to it that they're digging their grave. Destroy them. Lay waste to their whole grubby operation. They've sown their own demise in Bael'dun, <class>, and it is time to meet the reaper. "
1355,Silencing Rageroar,Slay 4 Rageroar Lieutenants and acquire Rageroar's Helm by killing Karga Rageroar. ,"I have encountered the Rageroar clan before, <name>. They are led not by an orc, but by a monster - a war-gorged fiend without a shred of decency or compassion. He and his lieutenants must be killed, not just to save Northwatch, but for the good of all of Azeroth. Karga Rageroar wears a helm. Execute him, <class>, and bring the helm to me. It is of. . . particular importance. Rageroar has made his camp across the chasm, east of here. "
1356,Put the Fear in Them,Kill 8 Honor's Stand Footmen and 1 Honor's Stand Officer. ,"Do you see the trail below us, <name>? That is MY trail. And if the Alliance dogs choose to use my trail, they'd best be looking over their shoulder. It's time to collect my toll! Slay the footsoldiers from Honor's Stand and see if we can't send them scurrying back to their walls. Be sure to take out at least one of their officers patrolling the road. They need to realize that nobody is safe. "
1357,Echoes of Agamaggan,Collect 3 Polished Boar Skulls. ,"I think the quilboar are being driven by more than just crude desire. Would you help me look into this further? To the west, scattered among the quilboar's settlements and camps, I've noticed boar skulls. They gleam from a distance, polished smooth. . . distinct from the remains littered in their waste piles. I think these may be objects of worship. Bring me several of these to examine, <name>. "
1358,Claim the Battle Scar,Go to the Battlescar. ,"We have fought the Alliance to a standstill here, even as the land beneath our feet falls apart. To the east you will find the Battlescar, a wide swath of decimated terrain. It is little more than a line in the sand, but it must be OUR line. In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls it. Scout out the flag. If it's not already ours, capture it for the Horde - it will swing the battle in our favor. Investigate the scar and kill anyone you find in there! "
1359,Clear the High Road,Slay 3 High Road Scouts. ,"This way, <class>! I see you've discovered the high road. The Alliance hopes to sever our ties with Stonetalon, but they forget that we tauren have hunted across these lands for generations. We know every hillside switchback and game trail from here to Thousand Needles. But for these paths to stay open, we must stop the humans from mapping them out. Patrol the trail east and kill any high road scouts you find along the way, then speak to Tunawa Stillwind just up the path. "
1360,Speaking Their Language,"Blow the Horn of Challenge in the Bristleback Challenge Ring, and defeat Sabersnout in single combat. ","The quilboar are attacking because they perceive weakness. Strength is the only language they understand. So we will show them strength. <Makaba withdraws a large horn from his satchel. >This is admittedly crude work but it'll do. Bristleback leaders use horns like these to challenge one another for dominance. <name>, I want you to challenge the Bristleback champion, Sabersnout, to single combat. Defeat him in front of his followers. Blow the horn at the Bristleback challenge ring due south of here. "
1361,Marching On Our Stomachs,Collect 4 Fresh Stormsnout Steaks by killing Stormsnouts in Southern Barrens. ,"It's true what they say: An army marches on its stomach. And we've been marching a long way. I'm thinking if we barbecue up a few of those giant lumbering stormsnouts, we'll have enough meat to feed us for weeks. Stormsnouts are big and slow, so they should be easy to kill. Except. . . Hey you're not carrying any metal on you are you? "
1362,Working the Bugs Out,Use the Bucket of Burning Pitch on the silithid mounds outside of Fort Triumph to flush out and kill 10 Silithid Swarmers. ,"Why high command decided that a silithid mound was the ideal place to build a fortress, I'll never know. Them lil' buggers are tunneling under our fortifications and setting back our timetables. We need to scorch 'em out! Take this here bucket of burning pitch and dump it on the silithid mounds right outside the main gate. They look like big piles of sand. Kill anything that comes out, but be careful, <name> - them nasties are likely to swarm you when you light those mounds up. "
1363,The Taurajo Briefs,Search the Ruins of Taurajo for 3 pieces of Taurajo Intelligence. ,"The General is too preoccupied with the looters in Taurajo. Too soft! We ought to be focused on our next move against the Horde. There's valuable intelligence that might be compromised if we allow the ruins of Taurajo to continue to burn. While you're running the General's errand, dig around for any maps or notes you can find. I can speak a little of the orcish tongue - I'll be able to make sense of what you find. "
1364,Sowing a Solution,Use Soothing Seeds on 6 Deviate Terrortooths or Deviate Plainstriders and observe the results. ,"Based on what you've brought me, I think we may have a solution. I've imbued the lashvine seeds with healing energies. Simple contact with these should imbue the creatures here with enough energy to force out the corrupted influence. Go and attempt to heal the mutated raptors and plainstriders by sprinkling the seeds on them, and report the results back to me. "
1365,Taking Back Taurajo,Kill 8 Taurajo Looters in the ruins of Taurajo. ,"Outstanding work at the gates, <name>! The main body of the Alliance force is in general retreat. But I'm not satisfied. They sacked Taurajo, which was little more than a hunters' camp. This 'Alliance' is unmasked at last for what it really is: A renegade band of butchers. Even now a group of humans linger behind to pick at the bones of smouldering Taurajo. <Bloodhilt hurls an axe into the dirt. >Make them suffer. "
1366,Warriors' Redemption,Acquire 5 crates of Confiscated Arms from Honor's Stand and re-equip 5 Stonetalon Prisoners. ,"Those that surrendered when Honor's Stand fell are no longer worthy of our Horde, <class>. But I'm not giving up on them yet. The prison tower below us is lightly guarded. Let's give those prisoners one final chance to die with honor. I've set up ropes that will allow you to quickly clamber up and down the mountain. Slip down, acquire the confiscated weapons, and re-arm the prisoners inside the tower. And <name>, stay by the tower! We're not yet equipped for an assault on the base proper. "
1367,Futile Resistance,Slay Kona Thunderwalk on the border between Stonetalon and Southern Barrens. ,"<name>, I certainly don't want to deliver my report to Commander Singleton without at least a little bit of good news. We've got to wrestle control of these roads back from these Horde holdouts. From what we can gather, Kona Thunderwalk is the name of the ringleader. He's got a camp just north of here. A Stonetalon native, he knows these roads better than his own hide. If we can wipe him out, resistance from the west might vanish. Find and kill Kona Thunderwalk, then report to Commander Singleton! "
1368,To Harvest Chaos,Kill 5 Outgrowths and find a Squirming Heart. ,"If I have truly sown chaos, it is time for reaping. The lumbering outgrowths of plant life shamble through the imbued stream here, <name>. They are a direct manifestation of the unstable forces mutating this area. Slay as many as you can, and we might be able to slow the spread of the overgrowth further. And while you're at it. . . be on the lookout for parts of them that appear especially corrupted. Bring any such pieces to me. "
1369,Hands Off Me Dig! ,"Kill 8 Excavation Raiders, rescue 5 Bael'modan Artifacts, and acquire Twinbraid's Tools in the Bael'modan Digsite. ","Look at the chaos down there, <name>! I've instructed the foremen to save what artifacts they can. Who knows what treasures these tauren animals are like to make off with. Can you help get a handle on things? Kill the raiders and save what artifacts you can. While you're at it, look for my missing tools. A few quick repairs and I can get this flying machine up and running again. "
1370,Firestone Point,Deliver Crawgol's Silithid Field Guide to Tauna Skychaser at Firestone Point in Southern Barrens. ,"I've been on top of this silithid situation for almost a month, which makes me the local expert. Just last week the Earthen Ring was visiting, and wanted me to write down everything I know. < Crawgol hands you a tattered book. >I'm not much of a writer. Or a reader, for that matter. But this book is probably the most definitive thing ever written about this foe. Deliver it to Tauna Skychaser down in Firestone Point. It's south of here, just west of the main road. "
1371,He Needs Ale! ,Search Bael'dun Keep for a Mug of Ol' Barkerstout and bring it to Marley Twinbraid at the entrance. ,"<Marley grasps the side of your head with a shaking, bloody hand. >Ale. . . Must. . . have ale. . . Ol' Barkerstout from inside. <He coughs. > That should. . . do the trick. "
1372,Bad to Worse,"Rescue 5 caged Taurajo Refugees, and kill any combination of 8 Bristleback Thornweavers or Bladewardens. ","When the refugees fled north from Taurajo, some were separated as darkness closed in. Many were taken prisoner by the Bristleback quilboar who set up camp west and southwest of here. I am not certain what the quilboar hoped to get from us by capturing our refugees; all they have earned is my ire. And all they'll get in return is vengeance. Rescue my trapped brothers and sisters, and kill their captors to send a message to the quilboar. "
1373,Mangletooth,Kill Mangletooth. ,"Una here used to spend time in Camp Taurajo. She's told me about a quilboar that used to be captured there, named Mangletooth. Quite the clever one, for a quilboar. I've been tryin' to think what got these quilboar riled up so much recently, and it might be that Mangletooth escaped Taurajo alive. If he has, he's certainly calling the shots. There's a large hut up in the hills to the northwest. If you find Mangletooth there, cut 'im down. "
1374,A Growing Threat,Kill 13 Razormane Quilboar. ,"A moment there, <class>. We've got more problems here than just the end of the world as we know it. Our vigil here's threatened by the quilboar. We've been content to leave them be when they stay in the Kraul, sure, but every day they press further and further out towards our camp. Mahka, bless her green heart, wouldn't ever forgive me if I went out bashing heads in myself, but if you could help drive back those that're wandering near the camp, I'd appreciate it. "
1375,Back in the Fight,Use the Herb-Soaked Bandages on 6 Wounded Defenders. ,"This fight isn't over, <class>. Not by a long shot. Some of the soldiers in the courtyard still have breath in their lungs. We can save them! I've soaked these rags in an herbal remedy we used to rely on back in Gilneas. The smell is awful but this poultice can practically raise the dead. Use these bandages on wounded defenders down in the courtyard and we'll see if we can't get them back in the fight. "
1376,Lion's Pride,Kill any combination of 5 Plains Prowlers or Plains Pridemanes. ,"Respect the lion, <name>! A ferocious killer. You gotta admire the elegance of the beast. . . Muscle and claws. . . Running down its food. . . So primal. . . I'm sorry, my mind wandered. As I was saying, I respect these lions, but they're just murder on our patrols. I mean that literally. The men are afraid to go to the bathroom alone at night. Can you help make our camp a little safer? Barrens lions like to linger under trees. "
1377,Warchief's Command: Southern Barrens! ,Report to Nura Pathfinder at the High Road in the Southern Barrens. ,"All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Nura Pathfinder at the High Road in the Southern Barrens. With the recent Alliance victories in the Barrens, our enemies are threatening to cut our supply lines and leave our warriors stranded. We must act! To reach the High Road, travel east from Stonetalon Mountains. If necessary, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! "
1378,Keeping the Dogs at Bay,Kill 6 Hecklefang Scavengers. ,"Not everyone who fled Taurajo was able to make it to Una'fe, <name>. Some died of wounds along the way. Others were jumped by opportunistic quilboar. I'll take care of the grim task of finding and gathering the bodies. But there is something you can do for me. Hecklefang scavengers prowl the lands south of here and are savaging the corpses, tearing at their bowels and dragging away the limbs of the dead. Please, thin their numbers so that I can perform the proper funerary rites. "
1379,When Plants Attack,Rescue 5 Taurajo Refugees by killing the Grasping Overgrowths that ensnare them. ,"This camp was built at the edge of this jungle, and already it is overwhelmed by plant growth. Something unnatural is happening here! Earlier I made the mistake of sending some of the healthier refugees out to gather nuts and berries. Those that returned talked about the plant life actually grasping at their legs or even picking them up. I worry about those that haven't come back yet. <class>, please rescue the refugees trapped in the grasping overgrowth around the camp. "
1380,Intelligence Warfare,Kill a Barrens Operative and retrieve the SI: 7 Briefings. ,"I am convinced the Alliance is using spies to scout the field and pass along information. They knew to strike at Taurajo while the hunters were afield. And they countered every one of Gar'dul's moves like he was an open book. Well <name>, I for one will not be outplayed. Not here. We will win the battle for intelligence. Even now I hear reports of Alliance operatives slinking around in the shadows, especially here, outside these very walls. Kill them and bring me back something of use. "
1381,Feeding the Fear,Kill 5 Tower Wardens. ,"Our resources are limited, <class>, but that doesn't mean we can't make some trouble down below. Use the ropes here to sneak down the hillside, then slay the human prison wardens. Killing a couple scrawny guards won't turn the tide of battle, but  imagine the fear and chaos we'll reap as the humans discover the mutilated bodies. . . < Holgom grins a yellowed grin, his eyes glinting. >"
1382,Desolation Hold Inspection,"Talk to Warlord Bloodhilt, then ride into Desolation Hold and inform Gar'dul that Warlord Bloodhilt is on his way. ","Thanks to you, the immediate threat is over. But my work here in the Barrens is only beginning. Honor's Stand was captured and Taurajo was sacked while Warlord Gar'dul was in charge of the region. The Warchief has sent me here to clean up his mess. I would like you to ride into Desolation Hold to the south in advance of me and let Gar'dul know that it is time for a reckoning. Talk to me when you are ready to leave and I will assemble my vanguard to accompany you. "
1383,. . . And Bury the Rest,Arm 6 Frazzlecraz Explosives in the Frazzlecraz Motherlode mine. ,"It's not enough to kill 'em - after Bael'dun, I want to give those goblins a taste of their own. Go into Frazzlecraz's mine and arm a pile of the explosives inside. At the entrance to the mine you should see some sort of switch or plunger. Once the explosives are armed, use the plunger to blow that place sky-high. Put the fear in 'em, <class>! "
1384,Teegan's People,Kill Terrortooth Runners and Terrortooth Scytheclaws to collect 8 Terrortooth Hides. ,"Hey, <class>! Are you headed to support Corporal Teegan? He's in charge of keeping the supply routes open. He's got two of the most ornery dwarves I've ever met in charge of sundries. If you want to make an impression on those two crotchety hunters, you're going to need to show that you can hold your own against the predators around here. The raptors west of the hold here are especially vicious. Bring Goucho some fresh hides and you'll make an impression while supplying the troops in one swoop. "
1385,Diplomacy By Another Means,Take the Horn of Challenge to the Bristleback Challenge Ring in Southern Barrens. ,"I have not forgotten my brush with death at the hands of the quilboar in that filthy jungle. The General here has ordered some tactical strikes, but he stops short of genocide. I have no such qualms. Take this horn that I 'borrowed' during my negotiations. Blow the horn within the Bristleback challenge ring west of our position - you can't miss it. I want you to challenge the champion of the Bristleback, Sabersnout, to single combat. His death in front of his followers will leave them in utter chaos. "
1386,Mangletooth,Kill Mangletooth. ,"I no longer care for honor or glory, <class>. All that matters to me is that the quilboar die, by any means, at anyone's hand. Mangletooth, the chief of these filthy Razormane, sits in his lair to the northwest, atop a hill. End his life. I plan to stay here, and pile these bodies until no more vermin run squealing from the Kraul to face me. . . "
1387,Who Did This? ,Look for a Horde corpse within Bael'dun Keep. ,"Sabotage! It had to be. The whole fortress magazine exploded. The Horde must've gotten someone inside. . . <class>, if you've the stones to rush into that burning nightmare. . . look for some clues as to who did this to us. The General will want to know! Look for a Horde corpse in the wreckage and get to the bottom of this disaster. . . "
1388,Lion's Pride,Kill any combination of 5 Plains Prowlers or Plains Pridemanes. ,"If you seek vengeance on our Alliance invaders, you would do well to observe the fiercest of predators in the Barrens. The lions that stalk amongst the tall grass do so with cunning, stealth, and power. Learn from their example and you will understand the kind of war we need to fight. Hunt the plains prowlers and pridemanes, then return to me to discuss what you have learned. You will often find them in the shade of large trees. "
1389,Hearts-is-Hearts,Slay a Landquaker Bull south of the Battlescar and collect an Enormous Kodo Heart. ,"These parts - so lovely! Muscle and sinew and fingers and toes. . . I am SO hungry right now. But work must come first. Once I stitch this pile of parts together I'm going to need a heart strong enough to pump sludge through this rat's nest of veins. I would use my own heart, but it's a shriveled up husk resembling a turnip. No, I need some real power. Get me a kodo heart from one of those giant landquaker bulls to the south of the Battlescar. "
1390,Twinbraid Needs to Know,Report to General Twinbraid at Twinbraid's Patrol in Southern Barrens. ,< General Twinbraid will want to know the details of this cowardly attack. You gather up the evidence. >
1391,The Deed Is Done,Return to General Twinbraid at Twinbraid's Patrol in Southern Barrens. ,"<You shield your eyes from the blast and the debris as the mine implodes onto itself. >< General Twinbraid will be pleased, but somehow you doubt it'll be enough to quench his thirst for vengeance. >"
1392,Hero's Call: Southern Barrens! ,Report to Commander Walpole at Stonetalon Pass in northwestern Southern Barrens. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Commander Walpole at Stonetalon Pass in the Southern Barrens. Our brave soldiers have made tremendous gains in the Barrens, but they have paid a heavy price! Your efforts are needed to consolidate our gains. You can reach the Southern Barrens from the Stonetalon Mountains by traveling southeast through Greatwood Vale. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
1393,Don't Stop Bereavin',Kill 13 Razormane Quilboar. ,"For a moment, I thought my hatred had stilled. My wife laid to rest, a final offering of the blood of her murderers to quell her tortured spirit. I thought perhaps peace would appeal to me. I was wrong. I will not rest now until every single filthy, squealing, murderous quilboar lays dead and broken! I cannot kill them fast enough with my own two hands.  Go and slay more for me, <race>. "
1394,Re-Take the Courtyard,Kill 10 Rageroar Grunts. ,"That's one way to clear a hill. Those corpses are impaled with knives and forks! The Rageroar clan has breached the walls, but we can still turn this fight around. Go down the hill and help our men hold on to the courtyard below. . . "
1395,Siegebreaker,Destroy 4 Northwatch Siege Engines at the Mulgore Gates. ,"<name>, you've proven yourself on the Fields of Blood. But the Alliance still threatens our tauren friends. The siege machinery outside the gates of Mulgore is like a spear aimed at our heart. I want you to go to the gates, south of here, and remove those siege vehicles from play. Here, use these stickybombs. They're courtesy of our new goblin allies. It looks as though they stuffed explosive powder into. . . what looks like. . . grease-covered socks. But they'll do. "
1396,The Nightmare Scar,Help Naralex seal the Nightmare Scar. ,"This confirms it. The overgrowth here is not being caused by a mere overabundance of energy. Do you understand? This is beyond what happened at the Wailing Caverns now. A rift into the Nightmare must have torn open in the middle of the very land we're standing on! And to think it's my fault. . . I'm done picking at the edges of this wound. Go to the west, to the center of the overgrowth, and meet me again there. We will dive into the heart of this corruption and force it shut! "
1397,Razorfen Roundabout,Glide through the rings. ,Fly through the checkpoint rings marking the course. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(75437))
1398,Run Out the Guns,Use a Northwatch Shore Battery to destroy 10 Rageroar Rowboats. ,"We've got the hardware but not the manpower, <name>. Man one of the carronades on the shore here and take out those incoming boats! "
1399,Holdout at Hunter's Hill,Speak with Onatay at Hunter's Hill in Southern Barrens. ,"Honor's Stand may have been lost, but its spirit was never crushed. Even now survivors are holding out at a point called ""Hunter's Hill. ""Continue following the high road and you will find our camp just up ahead. Speak with Onatay when you get there and let her know the trail is, for the moment, still clear. "
1400,Meet the New Boss,Kill Northwatch Recon patrols and collect 10 Theramore Merit Badges. ,"Our defense of the Barrens hasn't gone well under Gar'dul's command, <name>. Garrosh has sent Warlord Bloodhilt here to take control of the situation. He's here in camp, and if you want to make a good impression, you'll demonstrate some initiative. Head east into the Fields of Blood and seek out Northwatch recon units. Bringing the new Warlord a stack of their merit badges will help you make a name for yourself! "
1401,The Low Road,Deliver the Roadway Plans to Kilrok Gorehammer at Hunter's Hill in Southern Barrens. ,"This bundle of papers was found in a leather satchel hidden under the officer's clothes. Battle maps of the region depict Honor's Stand, connected to what appears to be a large unfinished roadway crossing the Barrens all the way from Theramore. It looks like the Alliance plans to build a road from the coast straight into the heart of Kalimdor! Kilrok Gorehammer will want to see this. "
1402,Mahka's Plea,Talk to Mankrik. ,"I can't put him out of my mind, <name>. Sometimes at night, I can hear his howls of rage and suffering, echoing across the plains. To imagine him out there, alone and in such pain. . . Please, I must ask a favor of you. Go to Mankrik, and tell him to come see me. "
1403,Breaking the Siege,Gather 10 Stonetalon Supply crates from the ruins west of Honor's Stand. ,"Horde scouts hiding in the ruins up ahead ambushed my supply train. Only two of my bodyguards made it out of there alive. And me? I used to have hair! The supplies I was delivering are scattered through the ruins up ahead. Gather them up and take them to Janice Mattingly at Honor's Stand. If they can't make it to Stonetalon, at least we can keep them out of Horde hands. . . "
1404,Filthy Animals,Kill 6 Hecklefang Scavengers. ,"You probably caught wind of some of them Hecklefang scavengers on the way in - they reek worse than ol' Durty Pete here. Worthless animals! They steal our kills, rummage through our supplies, and worse. . . they ain't good for eatin'. Go kill some. Then kill some more, if you want to. "
1405,Marley's Final Flight,Talk to Marley Twinbraid and take a spin in his flying machine. ,"Okay, <name>! Let's take these artifacts to my father and give him our report firsthand. Thanks to your help my flying machine is ready to roll. We can fly there together and share in the glory. Talk to me when you're all set to move out! "
1406,Tauren Vengeance,Seek out Gann Stonespire at Spearhead in Southern Barrens. ,"My people are not wrathful by nature, but sometimes a thirst for justice causes us to take up arms in anger. My old friend Gann Stonespire, on learning of the butchery in Taurajo, flew into a fury. Tribal elders could no longer hold his rage in check. Now he has all but parted ways with the Horde. He's gone rogue, <name>, and seeks to lash out at the Alliance with a small band of like-minded partisans. If you, too, seek vengeance, you will find him southeast of here, at the foot of Bael Modan. "
1407,A Line in the Dirt,Capture a neutral hill in the Fields of Blood and defend it against a Horde counter-attack. ,"Strategically, control of a region requires constant observation. See here on this map - I've identified a number of strategic hills, similar to this one, that the Alliance must acquire if we are to keep the enemy under our thumb. My scouts have already marked their location on the field. What I need is someone to spearhead their capture, and you're the <man/woman> for the job. Seek out neutral grey flags on hills to the north, east, and south of the Taurajo Ruins. Capture one and defend it! "
1408,Pick-a-Part,Collect 8 Siege Engine Scrap pieces from the Battlescar in Southern Barrens. ,"These bulky dwarven siege engines aren't cut out for the close-quarters fighting of the Battlescar. I've got some new designs I'd like to try out, but first I'm going to need some spare parts. There's plenty of wreckage sitting in the Battlescar. All I need is an enterprising <class> to haul it back for me. That's you, <name>. I'm talking about you. "
1409,Report to Aubrey,Report to Admiral Aubrey in Northwatch Hold. ,"You there! Fresh off the boat? Welcome to Kalimdor, a land hellbent to kill you or die tryin'. There's trouble at the hold - as I'm sure you noticed on your way in. Admiral Aubrey needs all hands on deck if we're to make it through this. Consider yourself drafted, <class>! Follow the road up the hill and you'll find Aubrey in the tower, topside. "
1410,Batteries Not Yet Included,Acquire a Humming Electrogizard from a Thunderhead in Southern Barrens. ,"Okay! Using the spare parts you've found for me, I've got a framework roughed out for my versatile new assault vehicle. All I need now is a compact power supply. I've noticed that the indigenous wildlife here packs quite the punch, electrostatically speaking. Can you hunt down Thunderheads near the base here and get me an intact electrogizard? It might take a few kills to find a usable gland. "
1411,Lifting the Siege,Use Paxton's Torch to burn 3 Rageroar Catapults and 1 Rageroar Blade Thrower. ,"We'll never be able to re-secure the fortress walls so long as Rageroar and his goons have access to artillery. I need you to fight your way across that chasm and take out his big guns. Orcs season their heavy machinery with coal tar, which makes them flammable. Take my torch and burn any catapults you see north of Northwatch. Then, torch those big blade-throwers in Rageroar's base camp! Those things have killed enough of our men. "
1412,Trouble From the Ground Up,Gather 10 Unusual Flower Buds from Budding Flowers in the overgrowth. ,"Teegan's a fool to think the quilboar caused this sudden overgrowth. Look around you. I've been watching these plants bloom and sprout daily - each generation is more mutated than the last. This isn't tribal magic - it's something primal. And dangerous. The day before last a great druid passed through our camp. Seek out Naralex, somewhere in the midst of this jungle. He'll know what to do. And bring him some plant samples from around the overgrowth to help his studies. "
1413,Powder Play,Defeat a Sapper Specialist near the Battlescar and acquire a Keg of Blast-O Powder. ,"Our shipments of saltpeter from Dustwallow have been held up, which means we can't manufacture our own gunpowder here. But I can retrofit our armaments to use goblin Blast-O powder. It's unstable, dangerous, toxic to the skin, and harmful if swallowed. . . but I think I can make it work! Get me a keg of the stuff by attacking one of those goblin sapper specialists who've been storming our walls. "
1414,Lashvine Seeds,Collect 4 Writhing Seeds from Lashvines. ,"There's got to be a way to cure these poor creatures without having to take their lives. I have an idea, but I'll need your help, <class>. The lashvine plants that roam here hold seeds full of the primal energy of this place. Collect these for me and bring them back, and we'll see if something can be done. "
1415,Concern for Mankrik,"Bring Mahka's Gift to Mankrik, south of Firestone Point. ","I would ask a favor of you, <class>. A warrior named Mankrik passed through our camp not long ago, on a lonely journey. His wife was killed by the quilboar, long ago, and he still seeks revenge. I cannot forget his eyes. . . burning with inconsolable hatred, every waking moment. We did not talk long, but I cannot bear to think of him out there alone. Please, bring this to Mankrik, and tell him it is from me. . . "
1416,Repel Boarders! ,Speak to Admiral Aubrey to fly to the Blackpool and kill 6 Rageroar Sea Dogs. ,"<name>, the sea is our only lifeline, and right now most of my fleet is either steaming back to Theramore for repairs or rusting at the bottom of this bay. Only the Blackpool remains afloat to defend our harbor. But she's just signaled that she's being boarded! Speak to me when you're ready, I'll have one of our naval gryphons deposit you right on the deck. Slaughter the rageroar sea dogs who dare assault my precious ship and report to Captain Fisher for further orders. "
1417,Raptor Scraps,Gather 8 Terrortooth Hides from Terrortooth Runners and Terrortooth Scytheclaws. ,"We are besieged here, <class>, and between that chasm and the harassment of the Alliance we are short on supplies. But we make do with what's at hand, as we tauren always have. In the absence of a forge, a skilled leatherworker can strengthen and patch up our damaged armor with good quality hides. Down below is the hunting ground of the Terrortooth Raptors. They are not so easy to kill, in part due to the ruggedness of their thick skin. Hunt them, <name>, and bring their hides to me! "
1418,Honoring the Dead,"Use the Funerary Totem on the corpses of Krulmoo, Dranh, Yonada, and Omusa in the ruins of Taurajo. ","With the immediate threat gone, can you help with some grim business? We tauren do not bury our dead, we prepare the body for its return to the elements and place it at our sacred grave sites. Those killed in the Taurajo massacre have had no funeral, and I worry misguided Alliance soldiers will burn the bodies of the dead before the proper rites have been performed. <name>, please take this totem to Taurajo and perform services for Krulmoo, Dranh, Yonada, and Omusa. They. . . didn't make it out of there. "
1419,Langridge Shot,Gather 15 pieces of Langridge Shot. ,"<class>! Thank the Light - they've practically driven us back to the docks. The courtyard is overrun! We're out of canister shot and the orcs are getting ready for an assault up the hill. We need to improvise some scatter-shot, and fast. Hurry, run into the broken tower here and grab whatever sharp, pointy bits of scrap metal you can lay your hands on. Knives, forks, nails - anything! Load the cannon when you've got an armful! "
1420,To the Front! ,Locate Ambassador Gaines at Forward Command in Southern Barrens. ,"I'd love to keep you here behind the lines, but it looks like you've been summoned to the front. Ambassador Gaines - remember him? - has relocated to Forward Command and in his latest missive he's requested you, personally, to assist him. You'll find our Forward Command operation south of here, in what's become known as the ""Fields of Blood. ""Be careful, <name>. The Horde has taken to ambushing some of our officers en route. "
1421,The Bad News,Bring the bad news to General Twinbraid at Twinbraid's Patrol in Southern Barrens. ,<You gently close Marley's eyes. ><Someone is going to have to tell General Twinbraid that the Horde has killed his only son. ><That someone is you. >
1422,Eye for an Eye,Slay Captain Peake and deliver his eyes to Oltarg. ,"Who goes there? Your footsteps are not the lazy stride of a guard. A <class>, you say? Still brave and free? There's no hope for me, friend. I have lost my eyesight and am no longer fit for battle. I dared speak up while Captain Peake savagely beat one of the prisoners. In return he kicked me in the head. And kept kicking. He kicked me blind, <race>. You'll find Captain Peake at the top of this tower. If you seek justice, bring me his eyes. If he does not part with them willingly. . . so be it. "
1423,Fields of Blood,Kill 10 Desolation Grunts at the Fields of Blood in Southern Barrens. ,"The Horde has taken to calling this region the ""Fields of Blood. "" It's an apt name: these reeds run red with the blood of some of my best men. I've sent out recon patrols to crush the quilboar and report on the Horde troop movements, but not all of them return. They could use your support out there. Patrol the fields and seek out the Desolation Grunts that are causing us so much grief. Do not expect them to surrender; their Warchief has instructed them to fight to the death. "
1424,The Disturbed Earth,Collect 4 Disturbed Earth Fragments from Disturbed Earth Elementals. ,"We are here to monitor the scars of the land, and watch for further signs of instability.  While we haven't seen any yet, a cataclysmic aftershock could devastate the Barrens even further. To the northeast, near the chasm, earth elementals rampage out of control. To soothe the earth, these need to occasionally be destroyed, and their essence returned in a ritual. If you help us do this, <class>, I would be happy to reward you. "
1425,Teegan's Troubles,Report to Corporal Teegan at Teegan's Expedition in Southern Barrens. ,"The Admiral will be pleased that Northwatch is almost secured, but if we're to keep a grip on this continent we're going to need to maintain the supply lines to the interior. Just before the assault I received the strangest of reports from Corporal Teegan, who's in charge of maintaining our contact with Forward Command. Says he's having trouble with the ""jungle? "" There's no jungle in the Barrens! Follow the upper road out of Northwatch and see if you can render any assistance to our wayward Corporal. "
1426,Survey the Destruction,Speak with Nibb Spindlegear at Honor's Stand to survey the cataclysm's destruction. ,"I had heard of enormous seismic anomalies here in Kalimdor, but I had no inkling that the geological chaos would be so profound! I need an up-to-date survey of the destruction while I stay here to study the seismographic readings. Could you gather some data via my automated survey craft? I'll take care of all the flying. When the survey is complete, present the data to my colleague Horton Gimbleheart in Northwatch. "
1427,A Family Divided,Find Kirge Sternhorn at Vendetta Point in Southern Barrens. ,"The children you see here were all rescued from Taurajo when the fighting started. I'm trying to track down their parents. One of the refugees you rescued from the quilboar recognized the strongest child as belonging to Kirge and Mawre Sternhorn. Moreover, he said Kirge was camped at the Fields of Blood, just north of the Taurajo massacre site. <name>, please go there and tell Kirge Sternhorn that his child is alive and well! "
1428,Report to Twinbraid,"Deliver the Frontline Report to General Twinbraid, who is on patrol in Southern Barrens. ","The Alliance owes a debt to the dwarves of Bael Modan, who built some of our earliest fortifications in the Barrens. Their commander, General Twinbraid, is a real stalwart. One of our best. He's on patrol south of here, keeping the Horde on their toes. I definitely want to keep him appraised of the situation here so we can coordinate our next move. Can you deliver this frontline report to him in the field? "
1429,All's Clear,Report to Commander Thomas Walpole at Stonetalon Pass in Southern Barrens. ,"Pack up your gear, <name>, it's time to join up with the rest of the Northwatch forces in Southern Barrens. Your first mission in Southern Barrens should be fairly straightforward. Two days ago we received a distress signal from Commander Walpole.

I'll forward news of our alliance with the Grimtotem to Northwatch command. "
1430,Signals in the Sky,Travel to Camp Una'fe in the Overgrowth of Southern Barrens and speak with Makaba Flathoof. ,"Turn your eyes to the southeast. Do you see the campfire smoke from Camp Una'fe? Not ten minutes ago I saw great puffs of white smoke roll up into the sky from the center of camp. It was an old signal used by my village to coordinate the hunt over great distances, but this time, it was a distress signal. <name>, my brother Makaba had gone into that unnatural jungle. Please go there and make sure he's not in any trouble. There are few paths: look for tents within the wilderness. "
1431,Nura Pathfinder,Report to Nura Pathfinder on the High Road in Southern Barrens. ,"Southern Barrens is under attack by the Alliance. The tauren have sent out a call for help that we simply cannot ignore. All able bodied soldiers of the Horde should assist. If you wish to help, take the path to the High Road, located in the village. Seek out Nura Pathfinder. "
1432,Make 'em Squeal,"Kill any combination of 8 Bristleback Bladewardens or Deviate Thornweavers, and collect a Bramblestaff from one of the Thornweavers. ","One of the native species in Kalimdor is the 'quilboar. ' Prickly little buggers. Reason enough to hate this continent. The raids started shortly after we established our forward camps. Worse, those spiny fiends seem to thrive in this thorny hell of a jungle. I need you to help beat them back so we can re-establish contact with Forward Command. While you're out there, acquire one of those twisted branches their casters seem to be using to manipulate the jungle growth. . . "
1433,"Grundig Darkcloud, Chieftain of the Grimtotem",Deliver the Alliance Weapon Crates to Grundig Darkcloud at Grimtotem Post in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"The Grimtotem chieftain awaits your arrival, <name>.

The Horde's grip on the Barrens shattered along with the land itself. I now receive reports that we are at risk of losing Malaka'jin to a concerted attack by the Alliance and the Grimtotem. If Malaka'jin falls, half of Stonetalon falls with it! You have proven yourself a capable soldier of the Horde. Will you be my eyes and ears at Malaka'jin? Witch Doctor Jin'Zil awaits your arrival. Malaka'jin is located far to the south. "
1435,Windshear Mine Cleanup,Kill 6 Windshear Overseers. ,"The Horde has overrun Windshear Mine. I'm not sure what these orcs are hauling out of here or why they're here, but I know that it can't be good. Get in that mine and take out the management.

Gone are the days of our people starving in the streets of Orgrimmar as we sign treaties with elves. We take what we need now. Kalimdor belongs to the Horde!

Looks like the orcs are piling that balloon up with some type of ore from the mine. Get in there and take the ore from the orcs. Bring me back whatever you manage to grab and I'll ship it off to the professor for examination. Before you go, a word of advice: you can avoid the Krom'gar pretty easily in there as (1) they're dumb as dirt and (2) they can't see anything if they're carrying ore. Of course, you need to kill them to get their ore. "
1470,Orders from High Command,"Take the Translated Orc Letter to Boog the ""Gear Whisperer"" at Windshear Mine in Stonetalon Mountains. ","The letter is actually an order from Horde high command. Someone named Overlord Krom'gar has issued a ""strip job"" on this mine in order to obtain something called azure iron flake. Presumably this flake is obtained from breaking down the ore. It gets worse. They plan to mix the azure flake with the explosives sitting inside the huge bomb outside and blow up Windshear Hold. We don't have a moment to lose, <name>! Take this translated copy of the letter and return to Boog! He'll know what to do next. "
1471,Final Delivery,Take the Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon to Cliffwalker Post in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"Overlord Krom'gar sends word from the base. You are to get back on the Krom'gar hot air balloon and take it to Cliffwalker Post. From there, the plan is to unleash the payload on the Alliance at Battlescar Valley. You better get going, <name>. It's not wise to keep Krom'gar waiting. Speak to General Grebo when you arrive at your destination. He'll be able to brief you on the next course of action. "
1472,Capturing Memories,Collect 8 Eldre'thar Relics. ,"The great cataclysm has unearthed a forgotten Highborne city within Stonetalon Mountains. You must venture southwest to the Ruins of Eldre'thar. Once you are there, search the area for ancient relics. Return the relics to me so that I may study them, <name>. Go! Lest we keep the arcanist waiting! "
1473,Report to Bombgutz,Report to Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz at Krom'gar Fortress in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"We must prepare for the impending attack. I will have our soldiers prepare the bomb for transport. I want you to report to Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz. She has been working to fix our anti-air cannons, but has thus far failed. Make sure that she is properly motivated to repair our guns, <name>. "
1474,The Deep Reaches,Speak to Steeltoe McGee at the Deep Reaches in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"The purpose of this base was to establish a foothold in Stonetalon for Theramore and to open up a supply line to the night elves. The Horde, unfortunately, has given us one hell of a fight. Hellscream's armies are mighty and unrelenting. I haven't seen this type of ferocity from the Horde since the second war. Now it would appear that the mine the Explorers' League dug out is being used by the Horde to ""backdoor"" us. We need to seal that thing off! "
1475,Kobold Fury! ,Use the Kobold War Horn near the Horde Banner at the Unearthed Grounds to unleash the Kobold Army! A level 10 Stonetalon Mountains Quest. ,"We now command the kobold armies of Stonetalon! It almost sounds impressive. Almost. <Devo sighs. >The Alliance base camp north of here is tightly guarded. It is nigh impregnable, save for the entry point by the Unearthed Grounds, northeast of here. Take this kobold war horn and head towards the Unearthed Grounds. Enter from the east, <name>! Once there, head west until you arrive at the location I have marked upon your map. Use the horn there to unleash kobold fury upon the Alliance! "
1476,In Defense of Krom'gar Fortress,Destroy 15 Gnomish Flying Machines or Bombers and 25 Gnome Wing Commanders. ,"There's no time left. Here they come! Take control of a heavy gun and shoot the gnomes out of the sky! If that bomb takes too many hits it will blow, taking us all with it! Defend the base, <name>! You're our only hope! If we somehow make it out of this in one piece, report to Overlord Krom'gar. "
1477,Shuttin Her Down,"Plant the Dynamite Bundle at the First Beam, Second Beam, Third Beam and Fourth Beam. ","To bring this mine down you're gonna need to blow up her support beams. I can provide you with the explosives you'll need, but you're gonna have to trudge through Krom'gar assassins to get to all of the beams. The good news, if any exists, is that we always mark our support beams with a big 'X. ' Look for the markers and plant this dynamite near 'em. Once you've planted all the dynamite come on back up here and I'll activate the explosives. Kaboom! "
1478,Lessons from the Lost Isles,Kill 12 Darnassian Scouts. ,"There are great dangers in the woods south of here. They are crawling with Darnassian scouts - assassins sent from Darnassus to kill us. Perhaps we can turn the tables on them, eh? When I was marooned on the Lost Isles a goblin gave me these infrared heat focals. They allow the wearer to see heat signatures of certain creatures. Take the focals and use them while in the woods to the south. They will allow you to easily spot the scouts. Kill as many of them as you can! For the Horde! "
1479,A Special Kind of Job,Report to Force Commander Valen at Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"You've done an admirable job down here, <name>. Force Commander Valen has taken notice and requested that you see him immediately. He's got a special mission lined up for you - one that'll hopefully put a cold stop on the Horde's incursion into Stonetalon. "
1480,Reinforcements. . . ,Use Subjugator Devo's Whip to Subdue 6 Boulderslide Kobolds. ,"It would appear as if we are running out of big, stupid orcs to send at the enemy. This is a problem. Thankfully, I may have a solution. Take this whip and head west to Boulderslide Cavern. Within the cave you will find a filthy nest of kobolds. Use my whip to subdue the beasts. Once subdued they will do whatever we ask them to do. Return to me when you have amassed a sizable army of kobolds. "
1481,"Burn, Baby, Burn! ",Obtain a Warsong Flame Thrower from a Krom'gar Incinerator and use the Warsong Flame Thrower to destroy 8 Warsong Stockpiles. ,"Deze orc incinerators zat burn ze forest carry viz zem powerful veaponry!

1483,Downfall,Kill the Horde generals at Camp Aparaje and recover the Insignia of the Horde General. ,"By the time that we received word that Hellscream had sent another mag'har orc to oversee the Horde troops in southern Stonetalon, it was too late. Camp Aparaje was burned to the ground and all Grimtotem in the area incinerated. Now the Horde have four of their most fearsome generals commanding the battle for Greatwood Vale, including the mag'har, General Glubgok. You must travel to the ruins of Camp Aparaje, south of here, and kill the generals. We stop the Horde NOW! Return to me with their mark! "
1484,If the Horde Don't Get You. . . ,Kill Queen Silith. ,"<Captain Kosak coughs weakly. >Was traveling up Webwinder Path, coming from Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in the south. Ambushed. Not by Horde. Spiders. Big, ugly, hairy, nasty spiders. Fought off dozens, maybe hundreds. Lost count. Overtaken by their queen. She took a chunk right out of me. Barely made it out alive. Might be dying. More of my men coming. Must provide safe passage. Kill spider queen. <Captain Kosak passes out. >"
1485,Death by Proxy,"Speak with ""Cookie"" McWeaksauce at Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in Stonetalon Mountains. ","Can you hear them fighting down below, <name>? It would appear that the Grimtotem tauren are no longer in the good graces of the Horde. I don't know what happened, but we can turn this to our advantage. I will arrange a meeting with an ambassador from the Grimtotem. What I need you to do is put together a peaceful offering. < Force Commander Valen points to Cookie. >Talk to ""Cookie, "" <name>. He's already been briefed on what we need to do. "
1486,Terms of Service,Deliver the Grimtotem Terms of Service to Force Commander Valen at Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"Grimtotem need weapons! The Horde, empowered by their Warchief and with the help of their new goblin allies, have amassed powerful weaponry. Our armaments are simply no match for their firepower. Supply the Grimtotem with strong weapons and we will work together to destroy the Horde! These are our demands! Supply the Grimtotem and we will fight for the Alliance! "
1487,The Only Way Down is in a Body Bag,Kill 8 Warsong Wing Commanders. ,The skies are swarming with heavily armored orcs on the backs of even more heavily armored wind riders. Our best efforts to bring them down have thus far proven fruitless. Our arrows usually just bounce off of those foul creatures. If we do happen to take one down the orcs deploy their goblin parachutes and safely land on the ground below. I need you to use Gnombus's sniper cannons and blow up the Warsong wind riders and then blow up the parachuting orcs. The only way down is in a body bag. 
1488,Armaments for War,Collect 10 Alliance Weapon Crates. ,"I am going to need to put you in harm's way once more, <name>. To the east you will find a mineral rich excavation site that was recently overrun by the Horde. At that site are crates of our weaponry, scattered about all over the place. The Horde has only recently taken over, so it is unlikely that they've found all of our supplies. Get in there and get our Grimtotem friends some weapons! "
1489,No Time for Goodbyes! ,Return to Scout Commander Barus at Mirkfallon Post in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"RUN! Get out of here, <name>. Get back to Barus and inform him of what you've discovered. He'll arrange for you to get safely across Battlescar Valley to Thal'darah Overlook. It's not too late to save those young druids! "
1490,World First: Gnomegen,Collect 1 Blazing Heart of Fire. ,"Good day, citizen, allow me to introduce myself. I am Salsbury, soon to be the world's first gnomegen. Malyk has assured me that as soon as my work here is complete he will grant me the gift of the worgen. So with the introduction out of the way, I've a request! Within the Charred Vale, south of here, roam newly created fire elementals. I desperately need a rare blazing heart of fire from one of the fiends. Get it for me and you bring me one step closer to becoming a gnomegen! "
1491,Might Makes Right,Meet Overlord Krom'gar at Cliffwalker Post in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"You have done well to report this crime. The perpetrators of this heinous act will be punished. There will be blood. I will need a new General now that Grebo is dead. You shall take his place. Meet me at Cliffwalker Post, General. Together we will end this nonsense. "
1492,Gnome on the Inside,"Seek out Minx who is disguised as a ""Goblin"" Pump Controller at the Sludgewerks in Stonetalon Mountains. ","Mirkfallon Lake is crawling with Horde. The goblins have set up shop and they aren't going to leave until all the oil under Stonetalon is sucked dry. Thankfully I have a gnome on the inside that's been collecting information for us. If anyone knows what's going on with that bomb, it's my inside gnome. Make your way to the Sludgewerks, north of here, and find Minx. She'll be disguised as a ""goblin"" pump controller. "
1493,The Unrelenting Horde,Slay 12 Horde enemies at the Unearthed Grounds. ,"While it is of utmost importance that you secure weapon crates immediately, we need the Unearthed Grounds to the east clear of Horde. If we are to open a supply line for our Grimtotem allies, we're going to need full access to the dig site. Kill all Horde that you come across at the Unearthed Grounds, <name>. For the glory of the Alliance! "
1494,Free Our Sisters,Obtain 5 Horde Cage Keys to free 5 Captured Huntresses. ,"Yesterday morning I dispatched a squadron of huntresses on a mission into Windshear Crag to obtain information about Horde operations in Stonetalon. Field intelligence reports that they have all been captured, including their squad leader, Huntress Illiona. Head east into Windshear Crag and slay the Krom'gar infantry that occupy the crag and take from them their keys to unlock the Horde cages holding our sisters. Do your best to locate Illiona once you've freed the huntresses. "
1495,Jin'Zil's Blessing,Use Jin'Zil's Voodoo Stick to infuse 12 Krom'gar Marauders with Voodoo. ,"Ah, it is done! Now to test it out. Travel to the main point of conflict within Greatwood Vale and use my voodoo stick on the Krom'gar marauders battling the Grimtotem. My voodoo magic should renew their vigor and allow them to crush our enemies! Go now, <name>! "
1496,Minx'll Fix It,Take the Illegible Orc Letter to Minx inside the Windshear Mine in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"The good news is that Minx is fluent in orcish and she's nearby. Head back into the mine and find her. She's probably deeper inside, standing around being useless. Don't forget the parchment! "
1497,Leave No Man Behind! ,Rescue 8 Frightened Miners. ,"Horde monsters! < Corporal Wocard spits. >Look at this place! They've wiped out innocents! Civilians! Listen, <name>, you've got to help us. Go into the Deep Reaches and look for surviving miners. If any are still alive they're probably scared witless! Check in the nooks and crannies of the mine. Maybe in mine carts! There are bound to be some left alive and in hiding. "
1498,Alliance Attack Plans,Recover the Alliance Attack Plans from Huntress Davinia. ,"<You pry the note loose from Fuzzwhistle's hand. >They're onto us! They know all about the bomb. Planning an attack on Krom'gar Fortress! I think they sent a search party after me. Won't go out like a chump. They'll get a fight. I think I hear them coming now! Their leader is a high elf huntress named Davinia. She spoke of attack plans. Avenge me by killing her and getting those plans! Her tent is nearby, to the east. Hellscream's eyes are upon you. . . "
1499,The Turd Problem,Kill any 6 Pridewing Wyvern. ,"We have a little problem. . . <Jibbly points to the large turds covering the base. >We built the Sludgewerks near a wyvern habitat. Now our initial blueprints for the Sludgewerks were drawn up so as not to disturb the wyvern habitat as the beasts are apparently sacred to tauren and orcs. Do you know what's sacred to me? Not getting pooped on, that's what! Between you, me and the wall, the wyvern must die! "
1500,They Put the Assass in. . . Never Mind,Kill 12 Krom'gar Assassins. ,"Ah, the Explorers' League - such a profound group of morons. Not only do we have tauren ghosts up our butts, the Explorers' League has also managed to open up a backdoor to the primary Horde base in Stonetalon, Krom'gar Fortress. Now we've got Krom'gar assassins silently executing everyone in the mine. I need you to head in there and clean house. I almost forgot to give you these goggles. Put them on immediately. They'll make all the stealthed assassins in the mine plainly visible. "
1501,It's Up There! ,Steal the Krom'gar Log Book. ,"Listen, I've been tracking this bomb since you rescued me in Ashenvale. Whatever they're doing with it is going to happen real soon. At the top of the large oil rig is a control room. Inside that control room you'll find a Krom'gar log book. That log book is the key to where this bomb is heading. Get up there and get the log book! Bring it back here and I'll decipher it for you. "
1502,Fight On Their Stomachs,Collect 8 Kalimdor Eagle Eggs. ,"The troops are hungry, <name>. With our supply lines cut off, we're steadily running out of food. I can cook the soldiers a feast if you can get me some ingredients. Head into the woods west of here and look for Kalimdor eagle nests. Steal the eggs from the nests and bring them back to me. "
1503,Is This Justice? ,Defend yourself. ,"He was a good boy, <name>. Young, loving. He would have never killed any of the young druids. They were his friends! No. . . Not Orthus. The General must be called to answer for this crime. I will have justice! "
1504,Fallowmere Beckons,Speak to Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"You're still here? What are you waiting for, a personal engraved invitation? Lord Fallowmere beckons, fool! Go to him now! "
1505,Schemin' That Sabotage,Use the Goblin Pump Controller to destroy 4 Goblin Oil Pumps. ,Goblins. . . What would this world be without goblins? I'll tell you what: CLEAN! Those filthy little scum suckers have planted their oil pumps all over the lake with the hope of extracting every last drop of oil that exists in Stonetalon. At each oil pump they've stationed an oil pump controller whose sole job it is to watch the pump and make sure nothing goes wrong. Something is about to go wrong. Take out the goblin pump controllers and take their pump controls. Use 'em to overload the pumps! 
1506,Back to the Depths! ,Kill Harbinger Aph'lass and 10 Invading Tentacles. ,"Tendrils are bursting forth from the earth and terrorizing Stonetalon Peak. My sentinels are hardly making a dent in their numbers. I suspect that there is a force at the heart of Stonetalon Peak that controls the tendrils.

1507,Seek and Destroy,Slay any 20 soldiers of the Alliance in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"The Alliance encroaches upon our territories within Stonetalon. The forces of Northwatch have broken through our blockade in the south and occupy Windshear Valley, to our west. From the northern front comes an onslaught of night elf soldiers. All must be stopped!

1508,Warn Master Thal'darah,Report to Master Thal'darah at Thal'darah Overlook in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"There are dozens of students at Thal'darah Grove. Most of them have no means of defending themselves, ripe for the slaughter. You must get word to Master Thal'darah of the Horde's plans. He will direct you in what you must do next. Fiora Moonsoar has granted you the use of her fastest hippogryph. Take it now to Thal'darah Overlook! Don't look back, <name>! The Horde must be stopped! "
1509,Beginning of the End,Take the Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon to the Sludgewerks in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"Champion, we have acquired a new target. Our scouts in Battlescar Valley report that the night elves are preparing their own weapon of mass destruction and hiding it within an ancient tree. They will never be given the chance to use their weapon against us. You are to escort the bomb to the Sludgewerks for refueling and then to Cliffwalker Post, from which we will detonate the bomb and kill all of our enemies. Go now, <name>. Report to Jibbly Rakit when you arrive at the Sludgewerks. "
1510,The General is Dead,Speak to Overlord Krom'gar at Krom'gar Fortress in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"Perhaps if you spoke to Overlord Krom'gar, <name>. Maybe he would listen to what you had to say? You are a Champion in his army, after all. You saw everything. Please help us, <name>. We simply wish to be left alone - in peace. Talk to Overlord Krom'gar and try to help him see that we did not mean for any of this to happen. "
1511,Thinning the Horde,Slay any 20 soldiers of the Horde in Stonetalon Mountains. ,The Horde's numbers swell as reinforcements from Ashenvale and Azshara arrive. There is no diplomacy to be had with the beasts. This is Hellscream's Horde and Hellscream's Horde wants our blood! We will not sit idly by and allow them to take our land and kill our people. We must act! We must thin the Horde! Consider it your daily responsibility. Venture forth into Stonetalon Mountains and slay as many of the Horde as you are able. Let them know that the Alliance will not surrender! 
1512,BEWARE OF CRAGJAW! ,Kill Cragjaw and take Cragjaw's Huge Tooth. ,"By order of Overlord Krom'gar, Cragpool Lake is OFF LIMITS! The ferocious beast known as Cragjaw has made the lake a death trap. Should you dispatch of Cragjaw, take his huge tooth as a trophy and return it to Spy-Mistress Anara for a reward. "
1513,Spy Infestation,Kill 8 Alliance Spies. ,"We've got another problem, <name>. Alliance spies are all over the place! You haven't seen any? That's because they're invisible! Cloaked! I have a solution, but I need muscle like you to go out there and follow through with my plan. Use this gas bomb on the cloaked spies and it will reveal them. Once revealed, send them back to their maker. You'll know a cloaked spy by the effect they leave in the air. Look closely! "
1514,Mr. P's Wild Ride,Kill 20 Goblin Technicians and 5 Goblin Harvesters. ,"Now Mr. P just needs an angel to help him navigate. Will you be that angel, <mister/miss>?

If we kill enough Horde, Mr. Fallowmere will buy us all ice cream! "
1515,Preparations for the Future,Collect 10 Deepmoss Venom Sacs. ,"Poisoned travelers are becoming a common occurrence around Windshear Hold. Why just the other day a Northwatch Captain fell prey to the spiders of the Webwinder Hollow. He would have died to the poison had it not been for my anti-venom. Sadly my stock of anti-venom is almost completely depleted. If you're heading south towards Webwinder Hollow, would you kindly recover Deepmoss venom sacs for me? You should be able to acquire them from Deepmoss spiders. "
1516,Proof of Lies,Find Orthus at Thal'darah Grove in Stonetalon Mountains. ,"At the heart of Battlescar Valley stands an ancient tree - a tree that has withstood the force of ages and has served as a place of peace and learning for generations. My kin have studied druidism at the grove, alongside the night elves, for as long as I can recall. Now I am to believe that the tree holds within it an Alliance weapon of mass destruction? Krom'gar is wrong and I will prove it! I have sent my son, Orthus, to Thal'darah Grove in search of this weapon. Go there now and meet him. "
1517,Just Ask Alice,"Recover the BD-816 War Apparatus, Mechanized Fire, Mechanized Ice and Mechanized Air. ","Mr. P is sick, <mister/miss>. Won't you help him? All you have to do is find his hat and batteries and he'll be all better. I'd go get them myself, but I can't leave Mr. P alone! His hat was stolen by the meanies in the Venture Co. over at the water wheel and his batteries are hidden around Windshear Crag. You'll just have to look real hard for those!

1520,Return to Stardust,Return to Huntress Jalin at Stardust Spire in Ashenvale. ,"Huntress Jalin will be pleased to know that the way to Windshear Hold is now clear. Please return to Stardust Spire and inform her of your success. She will most assuredly have more work for you now that our path is clear. Thank you and good luck, friend. "
1521,The Missing Blastgineer,Find Blastgineer Fuzzwhistle. ,"It looks like you might not be completely useless after all. Perhaps you can handle something a little more important. About two days ago I sent Blastgineer Fuzzwhistle to Windshear Mine. He was supposed to get there, make sure everything was going according to plan with the bomb, and report back. Two days and nothin'. . . Head out to the woods south of here and find him. For his sake, he better be dead. "
1522,And That's Why They Call Them Peons. . . ,Rescue 10 Frightened Peons. ,"These two are USELESS! When they first arrived I thought we were saved. Not so! Instead, Dontrag and Utvoch took one look at the mine and concocted some idiotic plan that involved standing here until. . . until we all died, I guess. You don't look nearly as useless. How about you lend a hand, friend? I've got dozens of peons, scared out of their gourds, hiding in the Deep Reaches. Find them and get them out! "
1523,Da Voodoo: Stormer Heart,Obtain a Cliff Stormer Heart. ,"With voodoo, our troops might have a chance at beating back the Grimtotem assault. With that said, I need several ingredients if I am to invoke black magic. The first ingredient on my list is a heart from a cliff stormer.

1524,Thal'darah's Vengeance,Kill 20 Horde soldiers and destroy 3 Krom'gar Demolishers in Battlescar Valley. ,"We must attempt to establish communication with Farwatcher Glen, to the south. Our Darnassian glaive throwers are at your disposal, <name>. Use them to cut a swath through the encroaching Horde forces and clear a path to Farwatcher Glen.

1525,BEWARE OF CRAGJAW! ,Kill Cragjaw and take Cragjaw's Huge Tooth. ,"By order of people not wanting to get themselves devoured whole by a really huge fish, Cragpool Lake is OFF-LIMITS! Someone decided to up and put a huge, dwarf-eating fish in the lake. It is strongly recommended that you stay out, however, if you are the heroic type and have a few friends around, do us all a favor and kill the damned thing!

Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope! Go after one of the swarmers.

1536,Warchief's Command: Tanaris! ,Report to Megs Dreadshredder at Gadgetzan in Tanaris. ,"All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Megs Dreadshredder in Gadgetzan. Help the Horde and the Bilgewater Cartel establish a presence in Tanaris before the Alliance does! You can reach Gadgetzan in Tanaris by traveling south to the shore from Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge in southeastern Thousand Needles. Or, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! "
1537,Thunderdrome: Grudge Match! ,Defeat Megs Dreadshredder. ,"It seems we have a special request! I have here a note from one Kelsey Steelspark, requesting to enter the cage and settle a dispute. She's asked for you to be her partner, <name>. A fan of your previous victories? Or perhaps you're acquainted outside the ring? I wouldn't back down now if I were you. This is the grand finale. . . "
1538,Just Trying to Kill Some Bugs,Talk to Narain Soothfancy to pilot the Mind-Controlled Swarmer into the Gaping Chasm hive. ,"Now it's time for my plan to go into full effect. We've got the captured bug strapped up with as many explosives as it can carry, and with Soothfancy's mostly amazing mental powers, we're gonna drive that sucker straight down into the center of the underground hive. And then. . . BOOM! No more bugs! You get the personal honor of directin' the ugly thing. Go talk to Narain and get set up with your bug-pal. "
1539,Dead Man's Chest,Kill 15 Southsea Pirates. ,"Well gosh, as you can plainly see there's this really big battle with these pirates here going on. We're doing our best to make sure they never bother Gadgetzan or our new gnomish homes there ever again! By killing them. So how about helping us? We really wanna make sure we kill more than green-nose over there and her awful thugs. I'd really appreciate it! "
1540,Thunderdrome: The Ginormus! ,Defeat Lord Ginormus. ,"The rules are simple: Two men enter, one--wait. Sometimes there's women. Two people enter, one--Wait, no, sometimes it's more than two. . . and that means more than two come out--Alright, only rule is stay in the drome! There are no other rules! You're up against the biggest, baddest member of the Wastewander Bandits first. This'll either be a warmup or a bloodbath. . . it's up to you which! "
1541,"Define ""Crazy""",Kill 10 Crazed Survivors. ,"We received reports that a goblin shipwreck occured on this beach some time ago, with the survivors left to fend for themselves. We expected there to be a modicum of survivors, perhaps some even suitable for interrogation. What we found was a crew of Bilgewater goblins who have all become insane, delusional, and maniacally violent. . . to further degrees than is normally observed, rather. In short, they are useless and dangerous. Gnomeregan will be best served by cutting down as many as we can. "
1542,Dead Man's Chest,Kill 15 Southsea Freebooters of any kind. ,"Look, babe, you should be able to see what's happening here pretty easily. There's pirates, there's goblins, the goblins are fighting the pirates. There's some sad little gnomes trying to fight the pirates too. I'll make it nice and simple for you: we need to kill a lot of pirates. Go do that, 'kay? We don't want the gnomes killing more than us, after all. "
1543,Rocket Rescue,Deliver Life-Rockets to 5 Steamwheedle Survivors and use bombs to kill 40 Southshore Blockaders. ,"Alright, <name>. We've done enough small jobs around here; it's time to seal the deal. The ruins of Steamwheedle Port are still full of hapless Steamwheedle goblins, waiting to be rescued. Every single one of them is a potential future customer. They're firing on every boat that leaves port. . . so I say we take to the skies! There's a hot air balloon just outside of town near the docks, we can use that. Go ahead and hop in, I'll catch up with you. "
1544,Secrets in the Oasis,Search for Jang'thraze the Protector. ,"Yes, I see the other half now, mon. . . to the south. . . We be close now, mon. It's in an oasis, buried in de muck beneath de water. Don't delay! "
1545,Sandscraper,Kill Sandscraper. ,"My other assistants are making sure our proud new comrades are put into comfy cages and shipped to where they're needed most. For the Horde. Meanwhile, we've got one last item on our agenda. Sandscraper, the chief of the Dunemaul Clan, is probably too dumb to even be aware of what we're doing here. But I absolutely loathe unfinished business, babe. He's lurking in the den just over there to the west. Knuckle down, take him out, and we'll be good to sign off on this, 'kay? "
1546,Maul 'Em With Kindness,Use the Bilgewater Cartel Promotional Delicacy Morsels on 8 Dunemaul Ogres after weakening them. ,"Okay, babe, listen up. There's two ways to get people to do what you want. You can provide goods, services, and things people want. . . or you can beat the living daylights out of them. I've often found it's useful to do both at the same time, and you're pretty familiar with both methods by now. Take these little silithid treats, go and beat some ogres dizzy, and then give them the treat before you knock them completely dead, 'kay? "
1547,Land's End,Talk to Kelsey Steelspark at Steelspark Station. ,"Psst! Hey! Come closer, you fool, you expect me to read your mind or--oh. Come closer anyway! You've done a wonderful job advancing the agenda of Gnomeregan here, friend! And an amazing job of pretending you were only in it for the coin, simply splendid. But now Kelsey Steelspark could use more of your direct help. She's moved on yet again. . . she asked me to tell you to meet her far south, at Land's End Beach. I wouldn't keep her waiting, either! "
1548,Cutting Losses,Kill 15 Hazzali Silithid of any kind in the Gaping Chasm. ,"I've spent the last week starin' at this ugly pit trying to think of how to exploit a bunch of dangerous, violent arthropods for profit. Now I'm out of ideas, and starving. These things are a wash, and I say it's time to start clearing them out. Head down into that pit and start killin' bugs. "
1549,Seaside Salvage,Collect 7 Steamwheedle Supplies. ,"We've got to get goods moving in this market ASAP if we want to be competitive. I've got an angle for us. Gadgetzan's under blockade by pirates, but plenty of the goods that get blown off the ships survive intact. . . they just wash away. Most of them wash up in the shallows just south of town. Head down there and start salvaging; there's crates full of pure profit just floating around down there. "
1550,Sang'thraze the Deflector,Defeat Zakkaru and collect the Sealed Sang'Thraze. ,"The blood speaks. I can feel its flow through the sand. . . drenched in death, a desert of suffering. . . < Mazoga 's eyes roll back in his head. >There! The blood flows to the south, in a valley of bones. Zakkaru! Zakkaru, spawn of Makkari, the dark one who demands sacrifice. . . his father forced from Zul'Farrak, his ascension interrupted. . . he will taste blood once more. . . <Mazora reels. >Go, <class>. Zakkaru has Sang'thraze. Ya not be wanting him to keep it, trust me. "
1551,Puddle Stomping,Kill 8 Tidal Striders. ,"Here's the situation. If we want to establish the Bilgewater Cartel's market presence in Gadgetzan, we'll need to start providing services to the community. The new coast has been great for business here, but the sea also brought sea giants with it. They're large, foul, and drive real estate values down. Head to the shallows just south of town and kill as many as you can, and I'll cut you in on some of the deals I'm brokering here. "
1552,Bootlegger Outpost,Talk to Zeke Bootscuff at Bootlegger Outpost. ,"We've done a bang up job here. I'm gonna make sure these mooks finish properly and then head back to Gadgetzan for a bit. If you want to keep making a good impression on our Steamwheedle friends, or just make more money, you should head southwest of here. Bootlegger Outpost is set up on the edge of the gaping chasm. Talk to Zeke Bootscuff. I'd bet good money he'll need help. "
1553,The Grand Tablet,Take the Grand Tablet to Gunstan. ,"At the bottom of the chest, you find a large tablet. Made of a material resembling stone, but completely smooth and flawless, it is covered in strange writing. While some resembles the writing on the walls, other scripts appear completely different. Gunstan would probably like to see this. "
1554,What Lies Within,Defeat the Antechamber Guardian. ,"As you lay your hand upon the chest, a faint rumbling can be heard. The sound of grinding movement echoes behind you as the chest begins to shut itself. Something is approaching! "
1555,Chicken of the Desert,Collect 6 pieces of Hyena Meat. ,"I've got an idea, but we're going to need bait. The other day I saw a rabid blisterpaw hyena wander too close to the edge of the chasm, and one of the silithid comes diving out of nowhere. Nearly swallowed it whole! Horrible sight. So we're gonna need hyena meat, obviously. Go gather some, make sure it's fresh, and bring it back here. There should be plenty just north of the camp. "
1556,Gazer Tag,Collect 5 Ocular Crystals from Glasshide Gazers. ,"You're going out to hunt hyenas, eh? If you don't mind, I've got an offer myself. I'm in need of eyes from the Glasshide Gazers that lurk to the north. Their eyes contain wonderful crystals, valuable to. . . collectors. Now, you may have heard that some sad individuals use these to enhance paramental abilities, but I assure you, my interests are purely academic! Bring me a good portion of them and I'll pay you well for them. Better than these copper-pinching goblins will, at least! "
1558,Gargantapid,Collect Gargantapid's Stinger. ,"No! It didn't work! I don't know what to do, unless. . . Oh gosh, it's worse than I thought! She must've been stung by the one lurking in the cave. I saw it the first night we arrived. Claws the size of a goblin. A tail as tall as a tree! We shared hushed whispers of it around the campfire. . . we called it. . . GARGANTAPID! . . . hey, are you laughing? Stop that! This is serious! Chelsea's life is on the line! Please, I'll make it worth your while. . . just bring me Gargantapid's poison gland! "
1559,The Qiraji Conqueror,Never have I seen such tenacity! The Bronze Flight grants you one final enchantment. ,"Rise, Qiraji Conqueror! Rise and be recognized! "
1560,Un-Chartered,Obtain 10 Charter Signatures from Dunemaul Ogres. ,"As I may have mentioned, I'm trying to get these Dunemaul ogres to join the Horde. . and  work for the Bilgewater Cartel as cheap local labor. To pull this off, we've gotta pay lip service to the actual initiation process and all that, or I'm going to catch flak later on. So I've gotten this charter drawn up, and slapped the initiation rites onto our own limited time offer labor stipulation contract. I've got a disguise for you here, so suit up and get all these signatures filled out. "
1561,Fragments of Language,Collect 5 Ancient Hieroglyphs. ,"We've had our first big find in years here at the Southmoon ruins. My lads have dug up stone tablets, engraved with ancient writings. The glyphs on the tablets are like nothing we've ever seen, but I have a hunch we can connect them with titanic scripts found at other digsites. Imagine what a breakthrough like that could mean! I need you to go to the Southmoon ruins and help us collect the tablets; the other lads can't leave, lest the blood elves take our site! "
1562,Ancient Obstacles,Destroy 6 Sandstone Golems. ,"For years, this valley has been sealed behind impenetrable gates. Now that the cataclysm has torn them down, the secrets within are ours to discover. There are yet some obstacles in the way. From within the gates, the bygone creations of the titans have awoken. They wander aimlessly across the sand, attacking any who approach. Someone needs to destroy the golems patrolling the valley; are you up to it? "
1563,The Thunderdrome! ,Talk to Doctor Dealwell in Gadgetzan. ,"Hey, friend, you interested in excitement? Adventure? Money? Violence? Well, you'd better like violence, because they just reopened the Thunderdrome in Gadgetzan. It was sad to see it unused for so long, what with the injury lawsuits, and the racketeering charges, and the copyright infringement. . . But it's back, and just waiting for burly, savage folk like you to enter and throw down with the foulest opponents ever! Head to Gadgetzan and talk to Dr. Dealwell to sign up. And tell your friends! "
1564,All Cheered Out,Talk to Zeke Bootscuff at Bootlegger Outpost. ,"Well gosh, we've cleaned up quite a bit here! <Kelsey clears her throat. >Listen, <name>, I'm looking forward to finally vacating this killbox so I can get away from these goblins and drop the cheer-act. If you'd like to continue to advance the interests of Gnomeregan, and by extension the Alliance, in the area, head south to Bootlegger Outpost. Talk to Zeke Bootscuff there, and remember that any work for the Steamwheedle will help us shut the Bilgewater out of Tanaris for good. "
1565,"You Too, Brute? ",Obtain Meatface's Chest. ,"It's time to conclude this matter efficiently. From what we've determined, this mysterious object is in the possession of the ""smart"" brute described in the journal. We don't know exactly what's happened to this creature, obviously, so you should take caution. This. . . ""Meatface"" is hiding in the hills, near where these goblins bury their dead. Look for the graveyard and he should be just past it. "
1566,Thunderdrome: Sarinexx! ,Defeat Sarinexx. ,"I hope you're ready for the next one, <name>. One mistake could mean instant, painful death! But that's what the people pay to see, isn't it? I hope you're not afraid of bugs. . . "
1567,The Path of the Invoker,Your continued defense of the children of Kalimdor has been acknowledged. ,"Your rise amongst the rank of the Brood is most impressive, <name>. May you never stray from the path of the invoker! "
1568,The Secrets of Uldum,Search the Antechamber of Uldum for an intact artifact. ,"We are ready to enter the antechamber itself, <name>. This is a momentous occasion. From the writings you've brought us, I believe these ruins were in fact once the grand entrance to Uldum itself. The quakes that ripped its doors open have probably collapsed the tunnels, but we may yet find amazing things hidden within. Search the ruins for anything intact that may be studied.  The thrill of discovery awaits! "
1569,The Grand Tablet,Take the Grand Tablet to Andoren Dawnrise. ,"At the bottom of the chest, you find a large tablet. Made of a material resembling stone, but completely smooth and flawless, it is covered in strange writing. While some resembles the writing on the walls, other scripts appear completely different. Andoren would probably like to see this. "
1570,Going Off-Task,Kill the Southsea Taskmaster. ,"That nasty ship on the east side of the cove keeps firing its cannons at us. It's kinda funny seeing all the goblins get hit by cannonballs, but some of my gnome friends are being hit too! It'd be really, really nice if you could make your way past those cannons and onto the ship. There's a mean ol' taskmaster yelling at the other deckhands in there, and I'm sure if you beat him up or kill him, they'll stop shooting at us! "
1571,Captain Dreadbeard,Kill Captain Dreadbeard. ,"Alright, babe, I've got something bigger for you to take on here. We spotted the captain of the Southsea over on one of his boats to the south; that's to the south, and NOT the one we've been suicidally bum-rushing for the better part of several hours. He's sitting up there, smug and stoic, watching us war down here. I'll spare you the ""hostile takeover"" jokes. Get on his ship and beat the tar out of him, and we're done here! "
1572,The Protector of Kalimdor,Never have I seen such tenacity! The Bronze Flight grants you one final enchantment. ,"Rise, Protector of Kalimdor! Rise and be recognized! "
1573,Rocket Rescue,Deliver Liferockets to 5 Steamwheedle Survivors and use bombs to kill 40 Southsea Blockaders. ,"When the water came in, Steamwheedle Port to the east was flooded, and a lot of poor goblins are still stuck there! Now those mean pirates are shooting at any boat that leaves the docks here. But they won't expect us to fly! There's a hot air balloon by the docks. We can use that, fly over to rescue the goblins, and take care of the pirates, too. Mr. Noggenfogger will be so pleased! Go to the docks and hop in the balloon and I'll be right behind you, okay? I've got to get some rockets. . . "
1574,Butcherbot,Use the Butcherbot to harvest 10 Glasshide Basilisk corpses. ,"I make my money around here selling animal parts. I've been perfecting a foolproof method of maximizing profit: The butcherbot! These little guys are programmed to harvest every scrap of usable material from the wildlife around here, on a case-by-case basis. He does all the work, and best of all, only I know how to get the goods back out of him. If you're interested in making some coin, take one of these guys for a spin. I need some glasshide basilisk parts; you'll find a bunch of them to the south. "
1575,Andoren Will Know,Deliver the artifact to Andoren Dawnrise at the Valley of the Watchers. ,"Listen carefully, <name>. I don't know how those ogres got ahold of it, but that thing's a titan artifact. I'm no expert, but just that fact alone makes it probably older than the sand we're standing on. I also know that things like this are nothing but trouble. I don't want anything to do with it. Take it south, to the Valley of the Watchers, and give it to a blood elf named Andoren Dawnrise there. And don't ask any questions, babe, please. "
1576,Terrapination,Obtain a Turtle-Digested Key from a Surf Glider. ,"We need to obtain the object described in this journal, for certain. Extracting it from a chest would be a feasible matter, but the object itself sounds compromised, and unstable. Attempting to forcefully open the chest could be disastrous. Fortunately, we know where the key is. . . statistically speaking, at least. There's plenty of sea turtles at the east end of this beach. One of them may hold the key. "
1577,Seaside Salvage,Collect 7 Steamwheedle Supplies. ,"If we want to convince Mister Noggenfogger to let us move more gnomes here, we've got to show him just how nice we are! I know just the thing. Gadgetzan's under blockade by pirates, but plenty of the goods that get blown off the ships survive intact. . . they just wash away. Most of them wash up in the shallows just south of town. If you could go collect those supplies for them, it'd help us make friends! And it'll keep that mean goblin girl over there from taking them and selling them. "
1578,To The Ground! ,"Use the Burning Rum to set fire to the Northwest Shack, the Northeast Shack, and the Southwest Shack. ","You know, this place would probably make a great home for us gnomes if it wasn't so old and dirty and full of pirates! We're taking care of the pirates problem, but the awful and dirty problem needs fixing. I mean, no self-respecting gnome would ever live in such an ugly hovel like these buildings! So here, take this bottle of flaming rum and go burn those ugly shacks down for us! "
1579,Sandscraper's Treasure,Talk to Megs Dreadshredder. ,"Inside this weathered stone chest at the back of Stonescraper's lair, you find a curious artifact. Shaped like a beetle, its surface is a smooth, brilliant blue, lined with gold. It looks mechanical, but unlike anything you've seen crafted by mortal hands, and very old. Megs will probably be interested in this. "
1580,Fragments of Language,Collect 5 Ancient Hieroglyphs. ,"At the Southmoon ruins, just east of here, we've made some finds. My colleagues have found stone shards, engraved with ancient writings, newly exposed by the shifting sands. The writings are in no known tongue, though they bear resemblance to markings we've seen on other ruins of the titans. Deciphering them could reveal many more secrets. Unfortunately, my colleagues are also busy defending the tablets from the Alliance. I need you to go to the Southmoon ruins and retrieve the tablets yourself. "
1581,To The Ground! ,"Set fire to the Northwest Shack, the Southeast Shack, and the Northeast Shack. ","I've conducted a thorough appraisal of the real estate here and, unfortunately, its market value is just far too low to be of any use. We're going to have to renovate. Luckily for you, I've learned a few things about arson. Hopefully you have too! You're going to be throwing these perfectly safe bottles of flaming rum at those filthy ramshackle huts over there. Try not to stand downwind. "
1582,The Path of the Conqueror,"You honor my kind, &lt; name&gt; . ","Your rise amongst the rank of the Brood is most impressive, <name>. May you never stray from the path of the conqueror! "
1583,Laying Claim,Kill 10 Blood Elf Ruins Hunters. ,"We're not the only ones interested in these ruins, it seem. Of all things, we've got blood elves after our dig sites. I'd expect them to wilt in the heat without all their fancy fountains and cushy pillows, but they're surprisingly scrappy, and they're trying to drive us out of the Southmoon Ruins by force. It's time to crack a few heads. Head over there and teach those elves not to mess with us! "
1584,The Path of the Invoker,"Impressive, little one. ","Impressive, little one. You have gone through much trouble to gain the favor of the Bronze Flight. Your dedication is noted. The signet ring of the invoker will greatly enhance your magical and natural abilities. Be warned, once you have chosen your path, you will have no recourse should you change your mind. "
1585,The Grand Invoker,Never have I seen such tenacity! The Bronze Flight grants you one final enchantment. ,"Rise, Grand Invoker! Rise and be recognized! "
1586,Momentum,Meet Kelsey Steelspark at Lost Rigger Cove. ,"It looks like we've got more work to do! Having Mr. Noggenfogger ask us to take care of the rest of the pirates is a true honor. Since you've been SO helpful, why don't you meet me at Lost Rigger Cove? I've just got to slip into something a bit more comfortable, so don't wait on me. I'll beat you there, promise! "
1587,Filling Our Pockets,Collect 20 Gold Fillings from Southsea Musketeers or Southsea Strongarms. ,"We've looted everything that isn't bolted down around here, but I'm not done yet. If we're bothering to do the Steamwheedle Cartel's dirty work for them, we're going to make as much cash as we can while we're here. I haven't seen many earrings on these pirates, so the gold must be in the next best place. . . their teeth. The Southsea musketeers and strongarms to the south are the higher-ups here; they'll be the ones with the adornment. Bring me back a good fistful of gold fillings. "
1588,Hero's Call: Tanaris! ,Report to Kelsey Steelspark at Gadgetzan in Tanaris. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Kelsey Steelspark in Gadgetzan. The Alliance needs your help to win concessions from the local baron and access to the area's priceless resources. You can reach Gadgetzan by traveling south from the Shimmering Deep in Thousand Needles. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
1589,The Path of the Conqueror,"Impressive, little one. ","Impressive, little one. You have gone through much trouble to gain the favor of the Bronze Flight. Your dedication is noted. The signet ring of the conqueror will greatly enhance your physical attacks. Be warned, once you have chosen your path, you will have no recourse should you change your mind. "
1590,Going Off-Task,Kill the Southsea Taskmaster. ,"As you may have seen, the ship docked to the north has its cannons blazing. While it's pretty fun watching the gnomes run face-first into a hail of iron, my bruisers keep doing it too, and it's absolutely killing my overhead expenses. I'd like you to try and dance through the cannonfire, get on that ship, and kill the taskmaster leading the cannoneers. The rest of the crew is probably a bunch of spineless prats; once he's down, we should be good. "
1591,The Secrets of Uldum,Search the Antechamber of Uldum for an intact artifact. ,"I studied these ruins for years trying to find a way in. We even took a good chunk out of the gate, only to find impenetrable walls beneath. Now the cataclysm may've wrecked everything in there something fierce, but it's done what we couldn't and opened a way in! I'd like you to have the honor, <lad/lass>. Head on in there and see if anything's been left uncracked. Be careful though. . . there's no telling what, or who, might be stirring in there. "
1592,Filling Our Pockets,Collect 20 Gold Fillings from Southsea Musketeers or Southsea Strongarms. ,"I know we're here to make friends with the Steamwheedle goblins, but those awful Bilgewater goblins are so rude. Why, I just saw a bunch of them pulling gold fillings out of the teeth of the Southsea musketeers and strongarms. Do they think they can just take that for themselves? Obviously, the nice thing to do is kill those pirates ourselves, take their fillings, and then give some of them to the Steamwheedle as a thank-you gift! Head on down there and beat those goblins to the punch. "
1593,Scavengers Scavenged,Use Butcherbot to harvest 12 Fire Roc corpses. ,"Now that I know you're not squeamish, I've got another job for you. Have you seen the red-feathered birds swarming around the bones out there? Those are fire rocs. They'll light you up good if you're not careful. They're also pretty darn valuable thanks to their unique anatomy. Most of the hunters loafing around here aren't up to the task of killing fire-spitting buzzards for money. . . think you can handle it? "
1594,Captain Dreadbeard,Kill Captain Dreadbeard. ,"This is getting pretty fun, but let's not forget we're here for Gnomeregan! We spotted the captain of the Southsea over on one of his boats to the south, past where all the fighting is. He's all alone on his little boat, undefended! If you go take care of him, we'll have the rest of these pirates mopped up in no time. "
1595,Blood to Thrive,Collect 6 Fistfuls of Blood from Sandfury Trolls. ,"To survive in de harsh desert, de Sandfury had to learn all de secrets of blood magic. You drink de blood, you get de power. . . darkest voodoo, yah? But dere be no room for holdin' back out here. If we gonna find de sword, we need blood. Lucky for ya, Mazoga be a traitor, yah? And dere be plenty of Sandfury trolls wanderin' over de hills dere. Go an' get Mazoga blood. . . plenty of blood. . . and we make de ritual to find Jang'thraze. "

1598,Returning a Favor,Find Megs Dreadshredder at the Dunemaul Camp. ,"You know, while you were out doin' your thing, Megs stopped by here. I hadn't seen her in months, but she barely gave me the time of day, just wanted me to tell you she had more business lined up. She said she was headed over to the Dunemaul Compound to set up shop, something about ogres. Since you're done here, might as well head over. . . I wouldn't keep a goblin like her waiting. "
1599,Thunderdrome: Zumonga! ,Defeat Zumonga. ,Splendidly done! But you'll be fighting more than mere humans! Your next opponent's a mean one. . . watch out for his right hook. And his left. I'd be wary of his fists in general. 
1600,I'm With Scorpid,Collect 6 Duneclaw Stingers from Duneclaw Scorpids. ,"You gotta help me, you just gotta! Chelsea and I came out here to make a bit of money, just sell some supplies, legit work. Next thing I know she's on her deathbed! She's got a fever that'd shock a blacksmith, and she's hallucinating. . . She must've been stung by the scorpids near here! I've seen it happen, it's not pretty. I gotta get some poison glands to make an antidote but I can't leave her side! Please, help me! Get me those glands! "
1601,A Few Good Goblins,Save 8 Captured Goblin Bughunters from Hazzali Cocoons. ,"We haven't just been camped here singin' songs with gnomes and playing with dangerous machinery, you know. My men have been trying to clear this hive out for a week now! Problem is, we've taken so many losses by now that the bugs have the advantage. Lucky for us, the bugs either don't like to eat goblins, or they like us so much they save us as treats, because nearly all my men are still cocooned up out there. I need you to go save 'em. "
1602,The Thunderdrome! ,Talk to Doctor Dealwell in Gadgetzan. ,"Hey, friend, you interested in excitement? Adventure? Money? Violence? Well, you'd better like violence, because they just reopened the Thunderdrome in Gadgetzan. It was sad to see it unused for so long, what with the injury lawsuits, and the racketeering charges, and the copyright infringement. . . But it's back, and just waiting for burly, savage folk like you to enter and throw down with the foulest opponents ever! Head to Gadgetzan and talk to Dr. Dealwell to sign up. And tell your friends! "
1603,Get The Centipaarty Started,Collect 20 Centipaarts from Centipaar Silithid. ,"Okay, babe. Like I said, the ogres are too dumb to know what signing that charter meant. Now we have to actually get them to come along with us, so we'll be procuring what is apparently beloved local flavor. Beloved local flavor for drooling idiots, I mean. Just pop on over to the Noxious Lair to the west, it's that big horrible pit full of dangerous silithid. Kill a bunch of the Centipaar silithid and bring back the pieces so we can hand 'em out, okay? Ciao. "
1604,Momentum,Meet Megs Dreadshredder at Lost Rigger Cove. ,"We can't just rest on our laurels here, babe. We've got to keep this momentum going! People are talking about us. Unfortunately, they're also talking about this air-headed gnome, Kelsey, who's apparently been running jobs right alongside us. If we're going to drive her out of what's rightfully a goblin town, we need to seal the deal here. We're going to take care of Gadgetzan's pirate problem for them, for good. Head south to Lost Rigger Cove, I'll meet you there. "
1605,Lootin' Plunder,Collect 10 pieces of Pirate Loot. ,"It's just really so wasteful that all these pirates have golden treasures lying around. Some of this stuff could be used for practical things! Like melting into wire, or intrinsic shielding matrices, or selling to other stupid races that buy gold just to keep it around. And speaking of other stupid races, I bet those greedy goblins are going to be taking all of it. We can't let that happen! Go collect that treasure for Gnomeregan! "
1606,The Path of the Protector,"You honor my kind, &lt; name&gt; . ","Your rise amongst the rank of the Brood is most impressive, <name>. May you never stray from the path of the protector! "
1607,What We Came For,Search Bilgewater Footlockers for evidence. ,"Gnomeregan previously learned that the Bilgewater goblins of the Horde survived a crash on an uncharted island near Kalimdor before arriving in Durotar. We initially came here to investigate what techniques and technology could possibly allow a hopeless pack of imbeciles to survive such harsh conditions. While the goblins are at a loss, we still need to find out exactly what happened here. Search the beach for wreckage and belongings and bring anything that appears significant back to me. "
1608,Booty Duty,Collect 10 pieces of Pirate Booty. ,"Let's not be wasteful here, babe. These pirates have tons of valuable nonsense just sitting around, waiting to be fenced. Can you believe they just sit on this stuff? I mean, why do they even bother taking it if it's just going to sit around? Stolen goods should be sold off and used to buy shiny new things. Anyway, be a dear and go grab as much of their loot as you can carry while you're out busting heads. Ciao! "
1609,The Path of the Protector,"Impressive, little one. ","Impressive, little one. You have gone through much trouble to gain the favor of the Bronze Flight. Your dedication is noted.

1610,Laying Claim,Kill 10 Dwarven Archeologists. ,"We are not the only ones who have discovered the value of the Southmoon Ruins. The dwarves of the Explorers' League have swarmed there, taking artifacts and inscriptions for the Alliance. I don't think I have to explain much further. We will not allow the discoveries here to fall into the hands of the Alliance. Slay as many dwarves as you can, and drive them from the ruins! "
1611,The Changing of Paths - Protector No More,"Champion, should you decide to walk another path, present me with your signet ring and a mountain of scarabs from our enemies in Ahn'Qiraj. ","Be well, <name>. If you change your mind, I shall be here to assist you. "

1613,Sandsorrow Watch,Speak with Trenton Lighthammer at Sandsorrow Watch. ,"If you're looking for more work, I've got a line for you. I know an elf by the name of Trenton Lighthammer who's been obsessed with the sand trolls near here for years. He's dead-set on finding some kind of mythical sword made by them, and just a while ago he finally got a crew together to go to Sandsorrow Watch and look for it. Last I heard, they kicked the trolls out of one of their camps and set up shop there. Look for it to the west, near Zul'Farrak. "
1614,The Path of the Invoker,Dedication of this magnitude is a rarity. ,"Your rise amongst the rank of the Brood is most impressive, <name>. May you never stray from the path of the invoker! "
1615,Blisterpaw Butchery,Use the Butcherbot to harvest 10 Blisterpaw Hyena corpses. ,"The hyenas wandering the wastes here might look scrawny, but they've got some of the strongest jaws you'll find! If you're not careful, they'll take a leg off in one bite. That kind of bone strength is a valuable resource, my friend, just waiting to find a buyer! Take one of my Butcherbots with you. Jaw separation isn't an easy task, and this little guy has been set up to know exactly what to do. Just bring him back when he's full. "
1616,Ancient Obstacles,Destroy 6 Sandstone Golems. ,"I've studied the gate here for years, trying to find a way of entry that wouldn't disturb any of the ancient architecture just behind it. It figures a few overgrown earthquakes decided to muck the whole thing up! But what's done is done, and the entrance to Uldum is revealed. I wasn't expecting anything to come out of the ruins before we went in, though. A whole mess of golems are running amok in the valley now, let loose from inside. Someone needs to clean them up if we're gonna get in there! "
1617,The Crumbling Past,Collect 5 Earthen Jewels. ,"The creatures wandering these ruins are Earthen, the ancient ancestors of dwarves, made by the Titans to shape the world itself. The original Earthen broke down and went awry thousands of years ago, and these freshly uncovered ones seem no different. We may as well make use of these confused and unstable constructs. Enter the ruins and destroy the Earthen, and collect the jewels embedded in them; their magical energies will be both valuable and worthy of study. "

1622,Prospector Gunstan,Report to Prospector Gunstan at Southmoon Ruins in Tanaris. ,"Say. . . you haven't been to Southmoon Ruins yet, have you?  Oh you simply MUST.  They have all sorts of fascinating titan artifacts.  Head west, and look for the Explorers' League tents. "
1623,Puddle Stomping,Kill 8 Tidal Striders. ,"There's a big problem here! It's great that the ocean came in so far, because now ships can get to Gadgetzan. But now there's a bunch of nasty old sea giants encroaching on the town! I'm sure Mister Noggenfogger would appreciate us taking care of them for him.

1631,The Road to Darnassus,Slay 8 Gnarlpine Ambushers. ,"The road to Darnassus must be kept safe. Corrupted furbolgs from the Gnarlpine tribe have been attacking travelers relentlessly. Important news and commerce travels to and from Darnassus by way of this road daily. We cannot afford to have a rogue band of heathens terrorizing people. Take up arms in the name of the sacred forest, <class>. Their den lies up this northern path. Slay these Gnarlpine ambushers and report back to me. "
1632,Oakenscowl,Collect the Gargantuan Tumor from Oakenscowl. ,"I figured it out! I had to rush here to find you! It's so simple really. . . the corruption has spread from timberling to timberling, but there's but one that is the source. Oakenscowl, he's being poisoned by the largest tumor I have ever seen. . . I would call it gargantuan, even. Oakenscowl used to reside in a cave near my lake, but has since found his way to a nook to the northeast of here. <name>, Hunt down Oakenscowl and collect the tumor; remove this source of corruption from my home. "

Lucky for you a day never goes by that I don't wish I had a fledgling <class> to perform my bidding. You see, <name>, I can make you very happy and provide you with things you never dreamed of having.  But in order for that to happen you must bring me certain items. My business in the forest often requires certain. . . reagents.  Fetch for me nightsaber fangs, strigid owl feathers and swatches of webwood spider silk. Let's keep this our little secret, <race>. "
1634,Dolanaar Delivery,Bring the Dolanaar Delivery to Innkeeper Keldamyr. ,"Greetings, young <class>.  Can you offer me aid?  I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of Dolanaar.

It lies along the road, to the south. "
1635,The Emerald Dreamcatcher,Retrieve the Emerald Dreamcatcher. ,"I was once given an emerald dreamcatcher from Gaerolas Talvethen, the warden of the druids in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. This powerful amulet is able to siphon energy from the Emerald Dream, bestowing luck upon those who carry it. Sadly, I have not been able to retrieve it from my dresser in Starbreeze Village. . . Although Starbreeze was once a tranquil place, it has now succumbed to the corruption of the furbolg that reside there. Perhaps you would be willing to recover my dreamcatcher, <class>? "
1636,Seek Redemption! ,Collect 3 Fel Cones. ,"The Council of the Forest has news that you aided Zenn Foulhoof. The satyr is an enemy of the forest. As a <race>, you should know better than to defile the forest by killing Nature's creatures. You must redeem yourself in the eyes of the Council if you wish to remain a friend of Teldrassil. Teach Foulhoof a lesson and you shall be redeemed. Fel Cones are corrupted seeds that fall from the trees. They billow with green smoke. Give some to Foulhoof. He'll think you have brought him a harmless snack. "

1638,The Enchanted Glade,Acquire 6 Bloodfeather Belts. ,"I was dispatched with a small group of Sentinels here to protect the Oracle Tree from the harpies that have made nests all around the glade. Little by little we are trying to push them back. When the Oracle Tree attempted to send a runner to Darnassus with a report, the messenger was attacked and killed by a group of the harpies. If you feel up to the task, go to their nests, slay them, and return their belts to me as proof of your deeds. "
1639,The Glowing Fruit,Bring the glowing fruit to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth. ,"Hanging from beneath the fronds of this glowing plant is a large, round fruit. Denalan would want to study this fruit, you are certain. "
1640,The Shimmering Frond,Bring a Shimmering Frond to Denalan. ,"The fronds on this plant shimmer in the forest light, giving it a twisting, pulsing aura. You believe that Denalan would want a specimen of this. "
1641,Nature's Reprisal,Use ireroot seeds to kill 12 grellkin in Fel Rock. ,"I'm glad you were willing to atone for your mistake - it speaks a great deal about your character. I have another task for you. I have gathered some ireroot seeds. They are somewhat like fel cones, but quite a bit more potent. Nature often responds very negatively to demons, and these ireroot seeds prompt a very concentrated form of that reprisal. To our north, in Fel Rock, there are grellkin that are far beyond redemption. Use the ireroot seeds to route them before they become a more serious threat. "
1642,Denalan's Earth,Bring the package of Rare Earth to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth. ,"Are you heading to the south?  To Lake Al'Ameth?  If so, then I have a task I might ask of you. . .

1644,Resident Danger,Kill 20 Gnarlpine Furbolg in and around Ban'ethil Barrow Den. ,"The Gnarlpine aggression is limiting our options. None of our kind are eager to bring blade and arrow against creatures that were once our friends, but I grow fearful that they are going to set their sights on Dolanaar soon. The biggest concern to me are the furbolg in Ban'ethil Hollow and Ban'ethil Barrow Dens. I need you to travel to the west, make your way into the Barrow Den, and kill as many of the Gnarlpine as you can. We probably won't have many more chances to limit their strength - be swift. "
1645,Teldrassil: The Coming Dawn,Fill the Tourmaline Phial. ,"There is one last moonwell that I would like you to visit.  It is directly south of here, on the shores of the Pools of Arlithrien. Be wary as you seek out the well, and keep your weapons close at hand. I sense a growing corruption from the boughs of southern Teldrassil.

1646,Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei,Fill the Amethyst Phial. ,"You must now visit the moonwell that rests under the boughs of the Oracle Tree, far to the northwest.

I will meet you at the crossroads in front of Darnassus when your task is complete. "
1647,Gnarlpine Corruption,Return to Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar. ,"The Gnarlpine tribe's corruption has returned! They ambushed me as I left for the Ban'ethil Barrow Den and proceeded to pillage Starbreeze Village. Something in the forest has corrupted Ursal the Mauler, their chieftain, and he is using the evil powers of the fel moss to drive them mad. I am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news.  The task is left to you, young <class>.  We can only hope that the deranged Gnarlpines have not made it to Ban'ethil yet! "
1648,Timberling Sprouts,Collect 10 Timberling Sprouts. ,"Small timberlings are sprouting around the waters of Lake Al'Ameth.  I'm afraid these sprouts are beyond help -- we should try to clear them from the land before they grow large enough to cause trouble. When you're wandering the lake, if you see any timberling sprouts please take them.  Help keep our land clean! "
1649,The Vengeance of Elune,Use the powers granted to you by Tarindrella to fight your way to the Heart of Corruption and destroy it. ,"As Teldrassil purges itself of the corruption that has perverted its growth for all of these years, a malevolent growth has formed near the tree's edge, south of here. We have an opportunity to strike out and purge the source of the fel moss that has tainted the gnarlpine, the timberlings, and everything else. With the water that you've collected from the moonwells and the renewed strength of Teldrassil herself, I can grant you great power for a short while. Put an end to this corruption, <name>. "
1650,Reminders of Home,Bring the Dolanaar Recipe Book to Fidelio in Dolanaar. ,"A friend of mine, Sister Aquinne, is training to be a priestess of the moon in Darnassus.  She left Dolanaar to study in the temple last year. Her letters say she is doing well and learning much, but she misses home and her old friends. I've put together a book of her favorite recipes from Dolanaar. If you have time, would you take them to her in Darnassus? You can rent a hippogryph from Fidelio. He's in the center of town, just across from the inn. "
1651,Timberling Seeds,Retrieve 6 Timberling Seeds. ,"The timberlings of Teldrassil are elementals of nature.  In some ways they reflect the natural order of plants and animals on our great tree. So it is disturbing to see how angry the timberlings are, particularly considering that things should be healing. I want to help hunt down the source.  I have been working on different methods of nurturing plants and would like to try them on timberling seeds.  Please, can you gather seeds from timberlings around Lake Al'Ameth and bring them to me? "
1652,To Darnassus,"Speak to Fidelio to purchase a flight to Darnassus, then bring the Dolanaar Recipe Book to Sister Aquinne in Darnassus. ","Everyone in Dolanaar is so proud of Sister Aquinne. I'm certain she'll be pleased to receive this thoughtful gift from Nyoma. When you're ready to travel to Darnassus, just speak to me again and for a few coins, you can hire a hippogryph to take you there. I'm told Sister Aquinne enjoys the solitude of a small plaza just south of the hippogryph master in Darnassus. Look for her there after you arrive. "
1653,Rellian Greenspyre,Bring a Timberling Seed to Rellian Greenspyre at Wellspring Hovel. ,"<name>, can you take one of the seeds you brought me to my friend, Rellian Greenspyre?  He is a druid that resides at Wellspring Hovel, and when last we spoke he revealed his interest in my work with the Timberlings. He had some ideas himself, and he will appreciate a specimen seed to work with. Thank you, <name>. I hope that, some day, you will see the fruit of my labors. You will find Wellspring Hovel along the road heading west out of Dolanaar, on the way to Darnassus. "
1654,The Waters of Teldrassil,Bring the Filled Vessel to Corithras Moonrage at the crossroads in front of Darnassus. ,"Our tasks are done here for now. This water proved to be of great importance, but it wasn't originally meant for me. Go ahead and bring it back to Corithras at the crossroads, I'm sure he'd like you to deliver it to its original destination. "
1655,A Troubling Breeze,Seek out Gaerolas Talvethren in Starbreeze Village. ,"A troubling breeze blows through the forest. Gaerolas Talvethren serves as Great Warden to the hibernating Druids of the Talon in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den.  His duty as the chosen protector of the Sleeping is to ensure their safety so that their pact with Ysera remains fulfilled. But word from Gaerolas is now delayed and I grow nervous.  Travel east to Starbreeze Village and bring back a report from Gaerolas so that I can put my worries to rest, knowing my dreaming brethren slumber safely. "
1656,Return to Nyoma,Speak to Leora to hire a hippogryph to take you back to Dolanaar. ,"It will be easy to get you a flight back to Dolanaar. Since you already know Fidelio in Dolanaar, you'll be able to fly back there without any problems. Whenever you arrive in a new town, you should remember to speak to the flight master so that you can fly to and from the new location. Speak with me when you're ready to hire a hippogryph to return to Dolanaar. "
1657,An Unexpected Gift,"Bring Sister Aquinne's Note to Leora, the hippogryph master in Darnassus. ","This is wonderful! It's just the kind of thing I need to remind me of home while I continue my studies in the Temple of the Moon. I'll try out one of the recipes tonight. I can't wait! Would you take this short note of thanks back to Nyoma? You can hire a hippogryph to take you back to Dolanaar. Just visit our hippogryph master, Leora, when you're ready to leave. She'll help you get a ride back to Dolanaar. "
1658,Teldrassil: The Refusal of the Aspects,Fill the Jade Phial. ,"Let me tell you more of the task you must complete. The druids in Darnassus use the water of the moonwells of Teldrassil, and their moonwell must be replenished from time to time. Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells. Take this vessel to the moonwell outside of Starbreeze Village to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me. Pay heed to the lessons of the moonwells, lest we find ourselves furthering our shortcomings. "
1659,Dahlia's Tears,Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple has requested that you recover Dahlia's Tears from soil freshly cleansed by a Ruby Keeper's flames. ,"In this dark time, I'll not be the one to abandon a champion of the Light. We will need something sacred for this to have a hope of saving your Bridenbrad. . . a remnant of a devout being that fell victim to this very same plague. Go now to the sacred soil of the passages outside my Ruby Dragonshrine where the battle is joined. As my Ruby Keepers fly down and set flame to the ground beneath undead feet, you will witness new life grow forth. Among that life are Dahlia's Tears - bring them to me. "
1661,The Ascended,Place a request to recruit Ascendants. ,"These shaman have spent their lives dedicated to the path of Air, Water or Fire.  On your request, we will beseech the elements to Ascend them, becoming a powerful, if short lived, force to deploy in this war against the Legion.

1662,Shape Your Fate,Place a work order for a Seal of Broken Fate. ,"The whims of the spirits can be guided, I have seen it.

There were whispers of an item, a way to change the path of destiny.  I heard dem, and I went looking.  For many years I listened to those whispers on the wind until one day they showed me the way.  This is what I offer you.  It will take some time, and some valuable resources, but I can perform the ritual to allow you to control this power.

Well?  Are you ready? "
1663,The Sullied Banner,Find Surigosa in Theramore. ,"So long as there has been magic, there have been those willing to utilize it for nefarious ends.

I am not certain what grievances these rogue mages hold that has prompted Surigosa to chase them down, but I am inclined to trust her judgment on the matter. Let us go to her, <name>; perhaps we can solve this rogue mage problem and convince Surigosa to return in a single turn. "
1664,Aftershocks,Teleport eight Prototype Mana Bombs. ,"These precocious whelps seem to be trying to recreate the very bomb that leveled Theramore. Predictably, they have yet to succeed. Still, I would rather not give them the chance to stumble into a more effective solution.

If our dear Aspect wishes to avoid simply turning the whole lot of them into mana dust, then I suppose I can refrain from carpeting the ruin in spellfrost. Someone will need to go and repossess their banal attempts at ordinance, though.

Do take care not to set them off, hmm? "
1665,Breaking the Cycle,Apprehend Turi Flickerflame. ,"With many of their rank-and-file captured, it is time to deal with the leader of this so-called Sullied Banner.

I imagine Kalecgos wishes to take her alive. I have no such compunctions, but I am not a picky dragon. So long as we put a stop to her schemes, I care little what happens to her.

His plan, though troublesome, seems to have worked thus far. I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for a short while longer. "
1666,Creative Solutions,Pacify the rogue mages of the Sullied Banner. ,"I have always hoped that mages would once again walk the streets of Theramore. This, however, is not what I had in mind.

If this Sullied Banner truly intends to reconstruct a working mana bomb, then they must be stopped--but I will not repeat the mistakes Malygos made. There must be a way to reason with them. 

I shall place an enchantment upon you that will allow you to subdue the mages without killing them. See to it that they cannot continue their ill-intended actions. "
1667,A Moment of Reflection,Return to Kalecgos in the Azure Span. ,"I do not understand what would drive Turi Flickerflame and her band of mages to attempt what they have done here today. But I do understand the pain of losing family. I understand the fear and regret that follows you wherever you go.

I have much to think about. I imagine Kalecgos has much yet to do in the Dragon Isles--return there with him. I will follow soon. . . I need some time to think upon what happened here today. "
1668,The Ancient Brazier,Reignite the Ancient Brazier and obtain the Sacred Flame. ,"What do we have here? A <race>? Come to steal our land with your honeyed tongue and promises? You do not fool me. I have lived a long time, and I know what dealing with your kind means. But the khans do not listen to their elders like they used to. Since you are here, I will put you to use.

Bring me the Sacred Flame. "
1669,The Mad Magus,Extract the soul of Mad Magus Tirth. ,"There's only one ting left dat we can do. Ya gotta slay someone with the big mojo in Tony's presence. No, not me!

1671,Carcass Collection,Collect 10 Creature Carcasses. ,"These organs be a good start, mon, but we still be needin' lotsa other tings. Normally, we'd be gettin' stuff from family now, but dats only me and my sistah's boy, and Tony ain't worth it! So, we be substitutin' some stuff. Lotsa carcasses, in fact!

1674,Haunted,Speak with Ajamon Ghostcaller at the Southsea Holdfast in Thousand Needles. ,"You think I'm going to just let you go after you killed me like that, mon? No way! I didn't create a piratical mercantile empire out of nothing just to see you bring me down. You're going to help me get back to life. Find my ex-wife, Ajamon, on the north side of the Holdfast.

1757,Quiet the Cannons,Destroy 8 Holdfast Cannons. ,"Now it's time to do something about those darn cannons up on the bluffs to the east! If you'd be so kind, hop into your boat and cruise on over to the Southsea Holdfast. Up top you'll see a bunch of cannons firing down on us. Those pirates don't know squat about engineering. It shouldn't be too difficult for you to clog 'em up and make them explode. "
1758,Defend the Drill,Defend the Oil Drilling Rig. ,"I'm not leaving here empty-handed! Are you? I bet you were wondering what's in the giant crate. Well, wait no longer. I want you to take one of our drilling rigs to the oil pools and pump us up some crude. Of course, you should expect the centaurs to attack. Just defend the drill long enough for us to get a barrel or two out of the ground. "
1759,"Circle the Wagons. . . er, Boats",Sink 15 Southsea Rowboats. ,"The fires may be dealt with, but those Southsea pirates are still getting ready to board the Speedbarge! <name>, you need to go back to Mazzer Stripscrew and get on your boat. Use the cannon to sink them before it's too late! "
1760,To New Thalanaar,Borrow a hippogryph from Seyala Nightwisp and speak with Caryssia Moonhunter at New Thalanaar in Feralas. ,We are staging a relief effort at New Thalanaar for all of Thousand Needles. Seyala Nightwisp will lend you my hippogryph to safely get you there. Speak with Caryssia Moonhunter when you land. You must go quickly if lives are to be saved! 
1761,Freezing the Pipes,Use the I-Scream Cryocannon to freeze the four pipes inside the cave. ,"It's time to break out the I-Scream Cryocannon! We lifted the tech from the frost cannons on the river boats. If it's one thing that we gnomes are good at, it's miniaturization by way of making everything else that much bigger! I need you to take the cannon down there into the cave and freeze the pipes we setup in the walls. That'll jumpstart them. "
1762,The Writ of History,Collect the Writ of History. ,"The Rattle of Bones is a part of shu'halo ancient myth. It is always connected with the Writ of History and the Drums of War. They are supposed to be powerful tauren artifacts; gifts from the Earth Mother if the tales are to be believed. I cannot imagine Her being connected with the drums, though. We must be vigilant if we are to find the other two. The writ will look like a pictographic scroll if memory serves. "
1763,Death to all Trappers! ,Collect 8 Trapper Nets. ,"There's only one answer for those filthy Twilight's Hammer trappers! Death! Bring me their nets, <name>. "
1765,Where's Wizzle? ,Find Wizzle Brassbolts at the Southsea Holdfast in Thousand Needles. ,"Hey, <name>, you haven't seen my other brother, Wizzle, have you? I just know that the pirates captured him! He said that he was going to try to sell them some engineering stuff, or something. Would you please look for him up at the Southsea Holdfast to the east? I'll bet that no-good goblin he's always traveling with, Synge, got him into trouble! "
1766,No Weapons For You! ,Burn 8 Grimtotem Weapon Racks. ,"The Grimtotem want to fight? Let us see how well they do without their weapons. I'm sure you must have something that burns. Set their weapon racks ablaze, my <class> friend. Let nature take its course. "
1767,Grimtotem Chiefs: Grundig Darkcloud,Slay Grundig Darkcloud. ,One of the most accomplished Grimtotem leaders of the Stonetalon Mountains has returned home. We must make the most of this chance and put an end to his campaign of terror once and for all. 
1768,Kodo Hide Bag,Bring 4 Light Leather and 4 Coarse Thread to Veren Tallstrider in Thunder Bluff. ,"The kodo beasts of Mulgore are strong and sturdy -- traits much respected among us.  If you are skilled in leatherworking and wish the knowledge to make a Kodo Hide Bag, then bring me supplies for my trade. Do this, and I will share my knowledge with you. "
1769,Gathering Leather,Bring 12 pieces of Light Leather to Veren Tallstrider in Thunder Bluff. ,"Greetings, young one.  You have a gleam in your eye; I can tell you are eager to venture back to the plains for the hunt.  May you bring honor to your clan! I work with the skins of beasts, fashioning them into clothes and armor for the people of Thunder Bluff. If you hunt beasts and bring me their skins, then I will fashion something for you. "
1770,Someone His Own Size,Defeat Retinus the Seeker in a pet battle with your Shadowbarb Hatchling in your party. ,"While fighting alongside you no doubt provides excellent training for our hatchling, sometimes it is better to have him fight on his own against enemies his own size.

I know of one such opponent nearby, observing the Amathet near the Obelisk of the Stars. You should seek it out. "
1771,Traitors! ,Hide behind the Neferset Frond and Uncover the Neferset Secret. ,"Please, stranger.  You must help me. I came here to investigate the arrival of a powerful ally to the Neferset, only to be betrayed by my closest allies and given up to the enemy. Go to the terrace above us to the east and find the information I failed to uncover.  You'll need to hide from the Neferset.  Perhaps you can hide behind one of the large plants on the platform to conceal your presence. Do this for me and I will help your friends find their way to safety. "
1772,Easy Money,Accompany Adarrah's caravan into Uldum. ,"Well, hello there! Whatever brought you, I'm so glad that you're here! My friends will never admit to it, but we could really use a hand. The ancient region of Uldum has been exposed! Treasures beyond your wildest dreams, free for the taking! We just need a bit of an escort, what with the bandits and all. . . You'll accompany us, won't you? You're welcome to all the loot you can haul off! "
1773,My Own Drone,Bring the Otherworldly Saddle to H'Partho Adoros in Ramkahen. ,"The saddle is complete. I can't say I enjoyed working with that corrupted metal, but in the end I can easily say this is the finest saddle I have ever crafted.

I know it looks. . . aggressive, but I assure you that your aqir will find it quite comfortable.

I hope it serves you well. "
1774,Do the Honors,Use the Orbs of the Stars near the mechanism in the Chamber of the Stars. ,"It looks like all that's left to do is to place the orbs on the pedestals at each corner of this mechanism. We appear to have stumbled upon what may be the most important find in modern history. <Harrison looks at you for a moment, then hands you the orbs. >Well, go ahead, <name>. We'd have never made this discovery without you. "
1775,Ignition,Recover the Lens of the Sun. ,"This guy just won't go down! You're doin' great, kid. Only one thing left to do. According to my research, there should be a titan statue down below. Use the device to activate it, then break it down. If my theory is correct, that statue holds the key to reactivating this obelisk. "
1776,The Defilers' Ritual,Stop the Neferset Ritual at the Murkdeep Cavern. ,"Ah, I can already see more clearly, <name>. We are right to be wary of the evil Neferset.  I can already sense that they're behind the forces that corrupt the river. Go underwater once more and find the Murkdeep Cavern.  You will find the Neferset are performing a foul ritual of corruption. Stop them so the river is cleansed once again. "
1777,Tailgunner! ,Use the tailgun to defend the Schnottz Bomber. ,"Okay, I've softened this guy up, how about you help me finish him off? I've got a plan for our escape, but it'll require a lot of guts and a little luck. You up for it, <name>? Just follow my lead. . . "
1778,Hero's Call: Uldum! ,Speak with Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris. Be one of the first to enter glorious Uldum and claim its treasures in honor of the Alliance! You can reach Adarrah 's caravan by traveling to the western reaches of Tanaris. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
1779,The Thrill of Discovery,Explore the Chamber of the Stars. ,"What a find! And somehow it's all remained untouched by plunderers. . . Listen, <name>. I need to document this site before we disturb anything. While I do, why don't you have a look around - you know, explore a bit. You've earned it. Keep your eyes open for anything unusual. Oh! And please. . . don't break anything, ok? "
1780,Gnomebliteration,Obliterate 512 Crazed Gnomes. ,"I have downloaded my program to the fusion core and have complete control over it. I've created a small pocket of air inside to avoid vaporizing user <name>. I will yield control of all movement functions so I can dedicate my cycles to keeping the core stable. Go down the hill and neutralize as many of the expedition members as possible. My analysis reveals you might feel. . . ""guilt"" as a result of such high fatality numbers. User <name>, you must be assured that expedition members are without hope. "
1781,Shared Goals,Defend High Explorer Dellorah as she deciphers the Amathet Tablets within the Chamber of the Stars. ,"The decree you found made mention of a plan to defeat the Old Gods. 

I know that the Amathet aren't likely to work with us toward that goal, but if they have a plan tae take out N'Zoth, it's worthwhile for us tae look at it.

The decree mentions the Engine of Ascension. I think that might be what they call that solar empowering device we saw earlier. We should take a peek underneath and see if we can figure out what they're planning! "
1782,The Coffer of Promise,Give Brann Bronzebeard the contents of the Coffer of Promise. ,"I'm not quite certain what ta expect 'ere, so stay on yer toes, eh? These codes should reveal the coffer's true purpose, and present us with the tools to thwart Deathwing's efforts in Uldum fer good! Stand back! "
1783,A Strange Disc,"Obtain the Sultan's Staff, then use the Elaborate Disc to create the Shaft of the Stars. ","The etching around the surface of this object indicates that it is of ancient origins, and yet no signs of wear can be detected. A hole on its edge, full of splintered wood, indicates that it is meant to be put atop a wooden staff of some sort. Before showing this to Doctor Jones, you should find the other piece. "
1784,Continued Incubation,Collect 10 Crystallized Void in areas under assault by N'Zoth's forces. ,"The egg is doing well, but we're going to need more of those void crystals to keep it healthy.

Could you go out and gather some? "
1785,Make Yourself Useful,Commander Schnottz wants you to persuade 6 Slacking Laborers to get to work. ,"Gobbles vill be sorely missed, but zhe mission must not suffer. Perhaps zhere is somezhink you can do to redeem yourself. Take vone of zhe uniforms you recovered. Vhile vearink it, my vorkers vill not behave so. . . aggressively. Lately, zheir morale has been a bit lackink. Some of zhe vorkers are refusing to perform zheir labors. Auch, zhe audacity! Find zhese lazy imbeciles and convince zhem zhat zhey must get to vork. . . or else! "
1786,They Grow So Fast,Help the Aqir Larva emerge from its cocoon in Ramkahen. ,"Look! Our little larva friend has entered the pupa stage! 

Wait. . . it looks like he's ready to emerge. 

Go on, give him a hand! "
1787,Battlezone,"Commander Schnottz wants you to man one of the siege tank turrets and use it to defeat 7 Decrepit Watchers, then report back to him. ","It vould appear zhat anozher opportunity has arisen for you to redeem yourself, <race>. Zhis little emergency has set me back a few tank gunnahs. You zhink you have vhat it takes to fill in for vone of zhem? My tanks are just vest of zhe camp. Get out zhere and put an end to zhis silliness! "
1788,Escape From the Lost City,Free Prince Nadun and speak to King Phaoris at Ramkahen in Uldum. ,"Everything is ready!  Undo my chains and set your friends free. We must move quickly before the Neferset scum realize we're up to something! If we make it, see my brother, King Phaoris for a reward. "
1789,Gobbles! ,Schnottz wants you to speak with him when you are prepared to witness the ritual. ,"At last! Zhe time has come to set my Gobbles free of zhat nasty curse! Pay attention now, <race>, and stay on guard. Zhere can be no interruptions vhile I perform zhe ritual. Let me know vhen you haf secured zhe perimeter! Now, move it! "
1790,Be Prepared,Collect 6 Rope Pieces. ,"Every adventurer worth their salt knows never to step foot in a cave, dungeon, crypt or tomb without an ample supply of rope. . . right? You can never have too much of this stuff! You resolve to scrounging every scrap of it you can find from the skeletons here. "
1791,Fire From the Sky,Board the Confiscated Artillery and use it to kill 100 Schnottz Infantrymen. ,"The remnants of Schnottz's organization persist here on the Maker's Ascent, making the region deadly to any who draw near. There's plenty of ammunition, but without a good spotter, I'm just firing blind. Hop in and give me a hand here. Those soldiers won't know what hit them! "
1792,Unearthed Artifacts,Collect 6 Titan Artifacts in Uldum. ,"Ever since the Amathet came out of their tombs, they've been busy unearthing titan relics from the surrounding areas. 

I'm not sure what they intend to do with them or if they're just hoarding it so we can't have them. Sufficed to say the Explorer's League would love to study some of what they found!

Of course, we can't get anywhere close to them without the Amathet trying to stick an axe in us, but that's not a problem for you, is it? 

Care to help? "
1793,Salhet's Gambit,Escort the Ramkahen Ranger Captain to higher ground. ,"Neferset City is too well defended.  The mountain next to it, however, is not. I've spoken to the ranger captain and he's willing to take a handful of his men and secure the strategic mountaintop. There is one catch, <name>.  He agreed, but only if you would spearhead the attack with them. It must be a small group, else we'll draw the enemy's attention too soon, but trust me. . . the rangers of Ramkahen are as tough as they come.  With you by their side we'll surely succeed. "
1794,The Incredible Egg,Bring the Voidtouched Egg to H'partho Adoros in Ramkahen. ,"<The aqir seem to have been in the process of empowering this egg with void magic.

It looks to be far from hatching, so it should be safe to study to find out what they were planning to do with it. 

Someone in the Explorer's League might be interested in taking a look. >"
1795,Lessons From the Past,Acquire the Broken Goggles. ,This unfortunate explorer has clearly suffered a bit of bad luck in the recent past. Prudence dictates that you perform the unenviable task of searching the corpse for clues that might shed light on your surroundings. . . 
1796,Artificial Intelligence,Speak to the A. ,"<A feminine voice addresses you over the portable terminal. >Emergency code: 55-729. Upper cerebral cortex functions in expedition members have been compromised. Please report to your nearest terminal location, to the southeast of the Sunstone Terrace, for further analysis. "
1797,The Push Westward,Report to King Phaoris at the Neferset City Outskirts in Uldum. ,"Our work is done here, <name>.  Against all odds, we stopped the Neferset advance on Nahom. Let us join the forces pushing west, lest they take all the glory for themselves. They must've reached the outskirts of Neferset City by now. "
1798,Meetup with the Caravan,Speak with Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris. ,"The pyramid inside of the Maker's Terrace in Uldum can be used as some kind of super weapon that will end all life on Azeroth. <Harrison thinks a moment. >You need to continue the research you've begun. Head to the southern end of Kalimdor, to the desert of Tanaris. There's a caravan there that's about to leave for Uldum. Perhaps you can tag along. "
1799,Myzerian's Head,Take Myzerian's Head to Sullah at Sullah's Sideshow. ,"The head of one of Deathwing's most formidable black dragons is now in your possession. While many in Azeroth would pay dearly for such an artifact, something tells you that it belongs in a museum for all to see and remember. Harrison Jones is likely to have the proper connections. Sullah would certainly be happy to deliver it to him. "
1800,Fire From the Sky,Kill 100 Schnottz Troopers while mounted on the Confiscated Artillery. ,"Sullah wasn't kidding. That hill is crawling with troopers! Jump on and paint our targets for me. Make every shot count, <name>! We need to be able to get up there. "
1801,The Pit of Scales,Rescue Tahet at the Pit of Scales in Uldum. ,A spot on the southern end of the map was marked with hieroglyphs of crocodiles fighting each other. That must be where Caimas took Tahet. Go to the Pit of Scales and find a way to rescue the Vizier's son. 
1802,Sullah's Gift,Speak to Harrison Jones at Pilgrim's Precipice. ,"Jonesy tells me you two need to make it up that mountain. Well, you're not going far with those troopers crawling all over it like ants on a carcass. Some of my friends were able to confiscate a bit of the enemy's hardware. It should make your journey a bit easier. Make your way up the ridgeline to the north, and you'll find it waiting for you. Good luck, you two! "
1803,The Desert Fox,Schnottz wants you to bring him the Desert Fox. ,"Zhere is much to be done in zhis region, <race>. Ve bozh haf a burning passion for zhe ancient technologies here, do ve not? Perhaps zhere is a vay for us to vork togezher? Let us put zhe misunderstandinks of zhe past behind us zhen, hmm? Now, zhere is an elusive animal in zhe region to zhe east zhat I have been huntink. Brink me zhis creature as a token of your sincerity, hmm? Zhen maybe I let you in on my operation. . . "
1804,Schnottz So Fast,Kill 10 Schnottz Elite Troopers in the Chamber of the Moon. ,"I'm nearly ready, <name>. Your scrolls contained enough information to discern their encryption method. Now all that's left is for me to translate the codes. I need you to scout out the chamber beneath the Obelisk of the Moon. There are likely to be a few of Schnottz's troops down there that escaped your blast. You take care of them and I'll meet you there when I'm finished. "
1805,Harrison Jones and the Temple of Uldum,Recover the Coffer of Promise. ,"After all we've been through, it looks like everything's actually coming together! We're just steps away from the coffer. . . I've researched the codes to reveal it. . . Schnottz thinks we're dead. . . . You know, we might just pull this off after all! "
1806,Be Prepared,Collect 6 Rope Pieces. ,"Every adventurer worth their salt knows never to step foot in a cave, dungeon, crypt or tomb without an ample supply of rope. . . right? Well, mine was in that wagon full of explosives that you set off. How about searching around here and seeing if you can't find some. "
1807,Salhet the Tactician,Speak to Salhet and slay 30 Bloodsnarl Scavengers. ,"Ever since I was a cub, I've always wanted to be a general. I was eager to join the army.  But as you've seen, my combat skills are not all quite there. This is not the first time I've been sent to kill hyenas.  As a matter of fact, I get sent here so often, that I've befriended these lions and trained them to do my bidding. They are my soldiers and at my command they will slay legions of hyenas.  Watch! "
1808,Eastern Hospitality,Belloc Brightblade wants you to mingle with the guests at Schnottz's Landing. ,"The commander is quite busy now, I'm afraid. The demands of an operation such as this require much of his attention these days. While you wait to speak with him, why don't you mingle with some of our guests? We have invited a variety of Azeroth's most illustrious figures to be present when we unlock the secrets of this region. I am confident that you will find them most captivating. "
1809,Thieving Little Pluckers,Smash 30 Sand Pygmies with the Tahret Dynasty Mallet. ,"I don't have the most glamorous job in the world. I do not concern myself with matters of war or the deep mysteries of the halls of Uldum or what have you. I am in charge of these grounds. . . and these grounds grow dates. Now, these little date-plucking mongrels have gotten gutsy enough to stand on each other's shoulders to try and steal my precious fruit. I will not stand for this. Take this mallet, crafted by the titans, blessed by the sun-kings and who-knows-what-else and smash the runts! "
1810,Exploding Through,Assist Harrison Jones at the Khartut's Tomb. ,"What a find! Right here. . . exactly where my notes predicted it would be. With any luck, inside this chamber will lie clues to the location of the legendary Coffer of the Promise. That's right, <name>. It's not just a myth. I believe it truly exists. I'll explain more later. For now, just give me a hand with these explosives. "
1811,Void Incubation,Collect 10 Crystallized Void in areas under assault by N'Zoth's forces. ,"Well one thing is for certain with this egg, it requires great amounts of void energy in order to thrive. 

It is fortunate for us that an Old God is attacking Azeroth at this very moment, yes?

No? Oh. . .

In any case, there should be an abundance of void energy wherever N'Zoth's minions strike. You should head out and find some. "
1812,The High Priest's Vote,Speak to High Priest Amet inside the Vir'naal Dam in Uldum. ,High Priest Amet 's vote is the only one that is completely outside of our control. He will vote as his divinations tell him and nothing we do will dissuade him. I figure that gives us even odds either way. The only problem we face is that his clairvoyance has failed him ever since the barriers around Uldum fell. He will not cast a vote unless he regains power over his divinations. Take the stairs at either side of the Vir'naal Dam and Speak to him to see what you can do to help. 
1813,The Curse of the Tombs,Slay 6 Crazed Diggers and Mekgineer Mixeltweed. ,The Neferset are not the only threat to our sacred tombs. A gnomish expedition stumbled upon our lands a few weeks ago. They did not heed our warnings and dug too deep within a cursed vault. Their entire expedition is now afflicted by a terrible curse that has robbed them of their sanity and taken control of their minds. They now seek access to the deepest vaults of Uldum and pose a great threat. Go to the Sunstone Terrace and put their wretched souls out of their misery. 
1814,They Don't Know What They've Got Here,Create the Titan Activation Device. ,"Listen, <name>. I don't have a lot of time to talk here. These guys are excavating relics from this site and taking pieces of ancient technology that we need! I need you to check their crates for pieces of an ancient activation device. The officers should have the codes you'll need to open them. Hurry! We can't let them load this stuff into their planes! "
1815,Seekers of Corruption,Collect the Sun King's Decree from Suntouched Amathet in Uldum. ,"If anyone would know more about the ""corruption"" the tablet spoke of, it would be the Suntouched that were put in charge of rooting it out.

Of course, I doubt they'll be willing to turn over any information voluntarily.

Luckily for me, you're a bit of a specialist at brute force investigation, aren't you? "
1816,Angered Spirits,Commander Schnottz wants you to use the L. ,"Doctor Venkman vas vone of my greatest researchers, until he had to be put out of my misery. He did leave me vizh vone of his greatest accomplishments, zhough. Against zhe properly attuned supernatural adversary, zhis veapon vill siphon zhe target's essence. It is of key importance in zhe ritual I vill be attemptink. Vhere do you come in, you ask? Simple. You have zhe priviledge of collecting zhe material. Zhe veapon is calibrated to vork on zhe Furious Specters in zhe temple to zhe east. "
1817,Impending Retribution,"Speak to Nomarch Teneth at the Tahret Grounds, Sun Priest Asaris at the Seal of the Sun King, and Asaq at Mar'at. ","Now that you've been suitably rewarded, I hope I can speak with you frankly. You've done my kingdom a great favor, but you've also unbalanced a fragile peace process. I was pursuing my brother's release strictly through diplomatic means in order to avoid bloodshed. Now, the enemy is sure to seek retaliation. Speak to Nomarch Teneth at the Tahret Grounds to the east, Sun Priest Asaris at the Seal of the Sun King to the north and Asaq at Mar'at to the west.  Find out where the enemy will strike. "
1818,By the Light of the Stars,Collect 7 Suspended Starlight. ,"Look at this, <name>. <Harrison holds up the dead scout's goggles. >I tightened the clamp in the middle and crimped the wires on the edges. They may not be the most comfortable, but they should hold together. If I've translated your tablets correctly, there's something hidden here - a final piece to our puzzle. I hope your spectacles hold the key. Let me know what you find! "
1819,More Fetid Filets,Collect 12 pieces of Corrupted Flesh from creatures in areas under assault by N'Zoth's minions. ,"Our little guy is getting hungry again. 

Could you pick him up a quick bite to eat? "
1820,The High Council's Decision,Speak to King Phaoris at Ramkahen in Uldum. ,The High Council is ready to decide on the war with the Neferset tribe. 
1821,Bleeding the Enemy,Obtain 10 Neferset Insignia. ,"I will not lie to you, <name>.  We face a tremendous challenge ahead of us. As you go behind the enemy lines into Neferset City, I want you to bring back the insignia of any Neferset scum you defeat. It will be a boon to our armies to know that you've dealt a crushing blow to the enemy. "
1822,Uncommon Core,Collect a Titanic Core from an Ivory Watcher in Uldum. ,"Our scouts have reported that the Amathet are constructing new titanic watchers. 

We had long thought this art was lost to the sands of time. It would appear we were mistaken.

I needn't tell you what a boon it would be to have the aid of watcher constructs in our battles for Uldum. We must unlock the secrets of their construction!

The power of a titanic watcher lies in its core. I ask that you bring one to me, so that our artificers might divine its construction. "
1823,The Root of the Corruption,Go to the northeastern source of the Vir'naal River and slay Scalemother Hevna. ,"You might have dealt with the symptoms of our problem, <name>.  But I've been studying these foul beasts and the eggs are not laid here by them. The stream from the current carries their eggs to the dam, but whatever is laying them will be found upstream. Go northeast, to the river's main source, and deal with the root of the corruption. "
1824,Meet Me In Vir'sar,Speak to Harrison Jones at the Oasis of Vir'sar. ,"So, listen to this, <name>. I knew that these obelisks were linked to the Coffer of Promise, but there's more to it. There appears to be something very important about the coffer - something pertaining to a place the Makers called the Halls of Origination. Now that we know this Schnottz fellow and his crew are in league with Deathwing, it's all the more urgent that we get to it first. I'll wait for you north of here, at the Oasis of Vir'sarHurry! They have a head start on us! "
1825,Punish the Trespassers,Slay any 10 Neferset intruders at the Tombs of the Precursors. ,"We, priests of Nahom, are guardians of the Tombs of the Precursors. Ever since the Neferset turned to their new masters, they've turned to great heresies. They rob the sacred tombs of our forefathers, seeking powerful artifacts and destroying invaluable relics in the process. Go to the tombs, east of here and punish the tomb-robbers for their transgressions, lest they join their brethren when the Neferset attack on Nahom begins. "
1826,The High Commander's Vote,Speak to High Commander Kamses at the Ramkahen Legion Outpost in Uldum. ,"If we're to pass a resolution for war, the high council's vote needs to be unanimous. I'm certain High Commander Kamses will give us his vote once he hears about what happened at Orsis. Please speak to him in Ramkahen and make sure that's the case.  I must make preparations in case our plan fails. "
1827,After the Fall,"Collect the Orb of the Morning Star, the Orb of the Evening Star, Orb of the North Star and the Orb of the Shooting Star. ","Aww, that was nothin', really. Those statues were teetering as it was - just needed a little push is all. How about you go and sort through that rubble? I've got a feeling we're close to getting this all sorted out. "
1828,The Scepter of Orsis,Obtain the Scepter of Orsis from the Sacred Receptacle. ,The chest below unlocks with a loud click as you insert the two stones into the plaque. Obtain the scepter and bring it back to General Ammantep. 
1829,Core Access Codes,Obtain the Core Access Codes from Twizzleflux the Insane. ,"The expedition's numbers are extremely large, user <name>. Dealing with them by conventional means would take you an estimated 2, 700, 136. 5 hours. We can make use of a powerful source of energy held within expedition's crawler vehicle. We will need the fusion core's access codes to accomplish this. Mekgineer Twizzleflux has these codes and can be found at the Starwatch Tower to the southeast. I've uploaded jamming frequencies to a scrambler.  Use it to temporarily disable Twizzleflux's defenses. "
1830,That's No Pyramid! ,Speak with Harrison Jones at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind City. ,"That pyramid at the Maker's Terrace in Uldum is nothing of the sort. It's a giant machine that can be reconfigured for any number of uses. Deathwing was going to have the Twilight's Hammer turn it into a massive weapon! <name>, you have to take the portal to get this information to Harrison Jones in Stormwind. He'll know what to do. "
1831,Neferset Prison,Go to the Neferset Prison Camp and find the whereabouts of Tahet. ,Hieroglyphs depicting a chained Tol'vir mark the southeastern corner of the map. Perhaps Tahet was brought there when he was imprisoned. 
1832,Warchief's Command: Uldum! ,Speak with Adarrah in Thistleshrub Valley in western Tanaris. ,All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Adarrah at the Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris. Ancient texts tell us that Uldum is home to untold riches and treasures beyond compare. Go forth and claim these in the name of the Horde! You can reach Adarrah 's caravan by traveling to the southwestern part of Tanaris and looking for her in Thistleshrub Valley. Destiny calls! 
1833,Aqir Instincts,Use H'partho's Whistle to summon your Aqir Hatchling and battle enemies in Uldum or Vale of Eternal Blossoms. ,"In observing the aqir battling the Wastewanders, I have seen the newly hatched immediately join the aqiri assault. It would seem the need for combat is born into these creatures.

We should exercise this in our new hatchling, under your supervision of course. Take him out with you and show him how to fight our enemies. 

He may not be able to fight for long, so don't call him until you're ready for training.

With luck, he will come to see us as part of his hive. "
1834,Field Work,Collect 10 Ancient Tablet Fragments. ,"This unfortunate pygmy was in the wrong place at the wrong time. As you ponder his bad luck, you take notice of the symbols covering his shield - far too elaborate for pygmy scrawl. Confident that Doctor Jones will find such objects of interest, you set out to find more fragments like this one. "
1835,Meetup with the Caravan,Speak with Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris. ,The pyramid inside of the Maker's Terrace in Uldum can be used as some kind of super weapon that will end all life on Azeroth. <Belloc thinks a moment. >You must continue the good research that you've begun. Head south to the desert of Tanaris. There's a caravan there that's about to leave for Uldum. Perhaps you can tag along. 
1836,I'll Do It By Hand,Defeat the Titanic Guardian. ,"Yes, this all looks familiar enough. Thanks to all the information you gathered for me, I'm sure that I can activate the mechanism. I'll just need some time free from distraction. As soon as I get started, you can count on that titan construct to try and stop me. That's where you come in. I don't need to remind you of what's riding on this. Take down that guardian! "
1837,Colossal Guardians,Obtain the Stone of the Moon and the Stone of the Sun from the Colossal Guardians. ,The chest containing the scepter appears to be magically sealed and will not budge. The plaque above it depicts two giant statues holding star and moon-shaped stones sockets at their center. The two statues are pictured guarding pyramids that look like the ones outside. Perhaps it's worth your while to investigate these. 
1838,I've Got This Guy,Kill 10 Schnottz Air Troopers. ,"Good timing, <name>. Seems I'm not the only one interested in these obelisks, and these fellas aren't inclined to compare notes. . . I think I can handle this guy. Maybe you could take care of a few of his friends before they make their way over here? "
1839,A Favor for the Furrier,Collect 5 Desert Coyote Pelts. ,"The commander can be most generous to those who demonstrate their loyalty, and I know of something that you can do to curry favor with him. Before building up his. . . ehh. . . workforce, he dealt in the furs of animals. He is quite skilled in the art of leatherworking. The furrier can do wonders with even the most tattered pelts. The dried oasis to the east is said to be home to a rare breed of coyote. Their furs would make a very thoughtful gift. "
1840,The Fall of Neferset City,Slay Dark Pharaoh Tekahn at Neferset City in Uldum. ,"We are ready to strike now, <name>. If we take down Dark Pharaoh Tekahn, the immortal colossi will fall and our armies will be able to march into Neferset City. Seek him out and engage him without fear.  I will make sure you're not alone when it's time to bring him down. "
1841,Fashionism,Belloc Brightblade wants you to collect 10 Trooper Uniforms. ,"We have a strict policy among our ranks, one that we take most seriously. Our troops are to dress in official uniform at all times. This helps with organization, friendly fire incidents are reduced, and it keeps the troops looking wonderful! We call it, Fashionism. We've been running low on uniforms lately. I must ask that you recover them from the troopers that have fallen in the line of duty. You should find plenty of the poor fellows east of here, at the Ruins of Ammon. "
1842,Al'Akir's Vengeance,Speak to Prince Nadun at the Arsad Trade Post outside Mar'at in Uldum. ,"Listen, <name>.  What struck Orsis was no natural sandstorm.  It was the minions of Al'Akir. The elemental lord of air is firmly allied with Deathwing and it was only a matter of time before he set his subjects upon my people. Orsis has been attacked as a warning to us.  We must move quickly to offer our brethren what aid we can. Meet with Nadun at the Arsad Trade Post outside of Mar'at.  I will begin preparations to take care of the displaced and wounded. "
1843,The Prophet Hadassi,Find the Prophet Hadassi in Orsis. ,Prophet Hadassi is the wisest and eldest member of the Orsis tribe. He has not been accounted for and his well-being is of vital importance. Go into Orsis and find him.  A great day of reckoning will come to the Al'Akir's lackeys if he's been hurt. 
1844,Missing Pieces,Collect 7 Ancient Copper Scrolls. ,"There are just a few specific pieces of information that I'm missing. Once those blanks are filled, we'll be ready to activate the final obelisk. Then, it'll be a race to discover the Coffer of Promise before Schnottz and his cronies can. Those fools are excavating this site as fast as they can. They're ruining more than they're looting! Go to the obelisk and rummage through their booty, <name>. See if you can find our missing pieces. "
1845,Lieutenants of Darkness,Slay Scorpion-Lord Namkhare and High Priest Sekhemet. ,"The armies of Ramkahen are getting obliterated by Neferset's immortal guardians. The only way to defeat them is to slay the Dark Pharaoh of Neferset. Before we make our move, however, we're going to need to take care of his lieutenants. Go behind the battle-lines and slay Scorpion-Lord Namkhare and High Priest Sekhemet.  Only then will we be ready to confront the Dark Pharaoh himself. "
1846,On to Something,Accompany Harrison Jones to the Chamber of the Stars. ,"This is remarkable work you've done! Especially for someone who hasn't taken my courses. These tablets provide new information on several subjects. They indicate that these obelisks are part of an enormous ancient mechanism that once kept this whole region masked from the rest of the world. They also depict how to recharge the mechanism, which is where your Shaft of the Stars comes in. . . Get ready, <name>. We have some history to make! "
1847,The Defense of Nahom,Speak to a Ramkahen Sergeant and succeed in the Defense of Nahom. ,"The enemy is coming. . . and in great numbers. We will get no further reinforcements.  Let us hope we can stop the Neferset advance. If Nahom falls, Ramkahen will follow. Go outside and speak to one of my sergeants when you're ready.  I will help you command the forces we have to the best of my ability. "
1848,Writs of the Sun King,Collect 6 Writs of the Sun King from Suntouched Amathet in Uldum. ,"Very little is known about the Sun King that leads the Amathet. Our observations suggest that those closest to him are the ""Suntouched, "" a unique caste of solar magic practitioners.

I would like very much to learn more about this Sun King but, unlike some members of the Explorer's League, I'm not willing to risk the lives of my researchers to do so. 

You seem to be able to hold your own, though. If you happen upon any records about the Sun King, I'd gladly take them off your hands. "
1849,Take it to 'Em! ,Mack wants you to investigate Khartut's Tomb. ,"We was lucky to escape, <class>. I'm not sure I'd feel right if we didn't take care of them ambushers. Hows about you git back up to Khartut's tomb and give them little buggers what fer! It's off to the northeast, just inside the entrance to Uldum if'n I recollect correctly. What're you looking at? I sure ain't in no condition to do it! "
1850,Reduced Productivity,Kill 15 Schnottz Excavators or Schnottz Overseers. ,"Alright, <name>, here's what I've learned. There's a titan device deep in a place called the Halls of Origination. It's meant to be an emergency reset switch for all life on Azeroth. If activated, it will destroy every living thing in the world! Now, it's only meant to be used under certain extreme conditions, but if Deathwing is able to corrupt the titan watchers, he could use the contents of the coffer to trigger the device. Go to the Obelisk of the Moon, <name>. Slow them down! "
1851,The Cypher of Keset,Obtain the Cypher of Keset. ,"< Salhet spends some time going over the tablets with the priests around him. >It's all right here, <name>.  Atulhet built a potent weapon into this temple and the only way to access it is with the correct cypher. It is reportedly hidden in the Keset Pass.  We must hope the Neferset looters haven't gotten to it yet.  That's where Raider Lord Havat is operating and he's the most ruthless of the lot. But without reinforcements, this might be our only hope for defending Nahom. "
1852,Put That Baby in the Cradle! ,Speak to Harrison Jones at the Temple of Uldum. ,"Och! You an' junior took yer sweet time gettin'  'ere, din't ya! ? <Drinkin' ale/Holdin' hands>, takin' in the sights, I'll wager. Don't go breakin' yer arm pattin' yerself on the back now, the real work's just beginnin'! There be more ta this ancient artifact than ye know, but in order ta reveal its secrets, we need ta get it to the Cradle of the Ancients! Now howdya spose we do that? Maybe junior over there has some bright ideas, eh? "
1853,Fortune and Glory,Kill the Obsidian Colossus. ,"We have to keep moving, <name>. It's just a matter of time before those troops get their act together. The coffer should be just beyond these ruins. Stay on your toes. Something tells me this isn't over yet. . . "
1854,Master Trapper,Sullah wants you to collect 5 Meat Scraps from the wildlife in Uldum. ,"One thing about me that you might not know, <name>. . . I come from a long line of trappers. My father taught me, as his taught him, to master the art of trapping creatures in a most merciful manner. As any master trapper will tell you, the most important ingredient in an effective trap is the bait. So let's start there. Fill this bucket with the meat scraps from almost any wild creature in Uldum. "
1855,Kavem the Callous,Obtain the Neferset Key from Kavem the Callous. ,"Kavem was cruel enough before the Neferset signed up with Deathwing.  His pleasure in deriving pain now borders on the insane. It is he who now holds the keys to our shackles. He dwells in the building next to us, to my right. Find him and take the key from him.  Do not hesitate or show him mercy.  He will slit your throat and think nothing of it. "
1856,A World Worth Saving,Stop the Amathet from taking the Halls of Origination. ,"We could not stand against them. Their warriors. . . wreathed in the sun's flames. . .

They want the forge. . . to end all. . .

Go. . . I will. . . endure. . . "
1857,Salhet's Secret,Find Salhet at the Southern End of the Sunwatcher's Ridge in Uldum. ,"Listen, <name>.  Before you give up on me, there's something I'd like to show you. You see, I'm not much of a fighter.  I'm not very coordinated. I'm more of a tactical mind. Meet me at the southern end of the ridge and I'll show you. "
1858,Eyes on the Amathet,Scout the Amathet territories with High Explorer Dellorah in Uldum. ,"On behalf of the Explorer's League, I'd like tae thank ye for helping establish the Uldum Accord and buying us some cooperation from Ramkahen.

In the interest of better understanding our foes, Ramkahen has allowed the exploring of the Amathet tombs. Unfortunately, though, their forces are spread too thin to provide protection.

I was hopin' ye could help out with that. 

Think ye could spare some time tae see what they're all about? We can start with an aerial look. "
1859,Tipping the Balance,Speak to Harrison Jones in the Chamber of the Stars. ,"<Harrison grins. >That's it, <name>. The pieces we need are hidden in these statues! They look to be a bit off balance as is. Maybe just a little nudge. . . I must say, your field work is coming along nicely. If you applied yourself, you could make a fine archaeologist one day. "
1860,Budd's Plan,Obtain 6 pieces of Neferset Armor. ,"I've an idea!  Trust me, it's a good one this time! Get some of those shiny armor pieces the cat-people wear. This plan cannot fail.  Trust me. "
1861,Crisis Management,Belloc Brightblade wants you to reassure the guests at Schnottz's Landing. ,"There is a delicate situation that calls for the. . . objective discretion of an outsider. You see, an unfortunate incident has upset some of our guests. Rest assured, our top men are sorting out the details. In the meantime, it would be wonderful if you could calm our more squeamish visitors. Handle this well, and the furrier is sure to hear of it! "
1862,Camelraderie,Use Sullah's Harness to tame 3 Camels. ,"Greetings, friend! You are always most welcome in my humble tent. Looking for something to do? Sullah has just the thing! Camels are good to have in hand regardless, but when putting together a performance the likes of my sideshow, they are an absolute must! Take this harness and use it to subdue a wandering camel. You may have to, uhh, humble it a bit first. . . if you know what I mean. You'll find a desert full of wild camels to the south. "
1863,Mutually Assured Destruction,Warn the defenders of the Halls of Origination about the Amathet's plan. ,"The Amathet want tae re-take the Forge of Origination so they can use it tae end all life on Azeroth, Old God or otherwise! 

They could strike at any moment. We have tae warn the defenders of the Forge! "
1864,Honing Instincts,Use H'partho's Whistle to summon your Aqir Hatchling and battle enemies in Uldum or Vale of Eternal Blossoms. ,"It looks like our little friend is anxious and ready to practice more combat.

Would you care to show him the ropes? "
1865,See You on the Other Side! ,Speak to Harrison Jones at the top of Maker's Ascent in Uldum. ,"Alright, <name>. We've bought ourselves a little breathing room, but there's no time to lose. Follow me! "
1866,The Ballad of Maximillian,Help Maximillian of Northshire kill the Devilsaur Queen. ,"The time we have waited for is upon us, Squire <name>.  Un'Goro's brood mother will perish at my hands.  The gravity of our task weighs heavily on me, but with the power of the Light behind us, we are guaranteed to succeed. Are you ready to depart? "
1867,Ever Watching From Above,Pull the levers behind Nablya and complete her tests. ,"When my master Khaz'Goroth shaped the world you call Azeroth, he designed Un'Goro Crater to be an area for experimentation.  You might call it the Titans' petri dish. If you seek further knowledge about the methods in which we observe the world, pull the four levers behind me and complete my tests. "
1868,Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved,"Rescue the Dweller by the Shore, the Dweller in the Cliffs, and the Dweller of the North. ","I've a feeling that we may find more than dragons here in this crater.  My paladin's instinct tells me that there are townsfolk nearby that require our aid. Those in distress cannot be ignored. Let us sally forth, Squire <name>!  The people of Un'Goro require our aid! "
1869,The Fossil-Finder 3000,Obtain an Enormous Dinosaur Talon. ,"One of the things I hate the most about digging is the fact that half the time, all you find is dirt.  That's why I've been spending most of my time out here tinkering instead of digging. Let me show you what I've invented: the Fossil-Finder 3000.  I just put the finishing touches on it.  If it works properly, it should find the largest fossils in the area.  I know, sweet, huh? Test it out and see if you can find some ridiculously big dinosaur bones. "
1870,The Bait for Lar'korwi,"Using the contents of Torwa's Pouch, summon Lar'korwi and defeat him. ","This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan.  Continue following the river to the north, and look for a bend in the river.  It was here I saw Lar'korwi last.  You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby. Take the meat you recovered and place it there.  Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat. If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will. "
1871,Crystals of Power,"Collect 7 Power Crystals of each color: red, blue, yellow, and green. ","I'm sure you've noticed 'em, <name>. They're everywhere! What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course! The crystals. . . They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them. Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me? You'll find yellow crystals to the northwest, red crystals to the. . . oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out. "
1872,Repairing A-Me 01,"You're pretty sure that A-Me 01 has asked you to obtain an Un'Goro Coconut, crack it on the rock nearby, and give her the High Viscosity Coconut Milk. ","<Suddenly, the robotic gorilla's eyes light up, and it begins to speak. >"". . . operational capacity. . . less than 5%. . . accidentally. . . punctured oil reservoir. . . """". . . use coconut milk. . . rock. . . save A-Me 01. . . ""<A-Me closes her eyes. >"
1873,"Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw? ",Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 12 Silithid Eggs. ,"The venomhide hatchling 's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention. It begins scratching pictures of silithids into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them. It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles. They can only mean silithid eggs. The Noxious Lair, in western Tanaris and near the border with Un'Goro Crater, would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants. "
1874,The Scent of Lar'korwi,Obtain 2 Ravasaur Pheromone Glands. ,"I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, <name>. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us. Being the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands. "
1875,How to Make Meat Fresh Again,Use the Scraps of Rotting Meat on nearby dinosaurs to lure them into the pits around Marshal's Stand. ,"I don't believe we've met. . . I'm Nolen Tacker, Marshal Expeditions' new chief of the guards.  I'm also their chef.  There's actually more overlap than you'd think. I've got a fun little task for you.  Have you seen the spike pits around the perimeter of the camp?  See if you can convince some of the nearby dinosaurs to walk into them.  If you throw this rotten meat at them when they're not looking, it'll either make them hungry or angry.  Either way is fine, as long as they follow you into the pit! "
1876,The Shaper's Terrace,"Speak with the Un'Goro Examinant to teleport to The Shaper's Terrace, then speak with Nablya. ","<As you look into the orb in front of you, you hear a voice. >The crystal pylons have been activated.  A sufficient number of crystals have been gathered.  The prerequisites have been met.  We are prepared for teleport to The Shaper's Terrace. Speak to me when you are ready, <race>.  We will consult with The Watcher. "
1877,A Little Help From My Friends,Lead Ringo to Spraggle Frock at Marshal's Stand. ,"Ugh. . . It's so hot. . . I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion. Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Stand. I think I'm well enough to follow you there. I am feeling a little out of it, so you can slap me if I'm feeling woozy.  If I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope. . . "
1878,Warchief's Command: Un'Goro Crater! ,Report to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand in Un'Goro Crater. ,"All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand. You are to provide aid to the Marshal Expeditions' personnel as they uncover the secrets of Un'Goro Crater. The Horde may be able to find a use for the unique beasts and crystals populating the crater. You can reach Un'Goro Crater by taking the road from western Tanaris down into the crater and toward Marshal's Stand. Or, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! "
1879,The Eastern Pylon,Touch the Eastern Crystal Pylon in Un'Goro Crater. ,"High up in the cliffs above me there is a large crystal pylon.  Who placed it there, I cannot say, nor can I determine any reason that it would be built in such a strange place. Maybe you can make more of it than I can.  I personally don't care what it does, so you needn't report back to me, but perhaps one of the scholars in Marshal's Stand might be interested in what you discover. "
1880,Lost! ,Find signs of Ringo at Fire Plume Ridge. ,"You've got to help me, <name>! My friend, Ringo left earlier to explore the volcano to the north of here, and he has been gone way too long. I am really worried about him. Do you think you could find him? Why don't you take my canteen with you -- if you do find Ringo, I'm sure he'll need it! "
1881,The Spirits of Golakka Hot Springs,Stand by as Maximillian of Northshire speaks to 2 Steam Furies. ,"A moment of seriousness now, <name>.  We have an important quest ahead of us.  The treacherous dragons that plague this valley will not cease their mischief until we destroy their repugnant brood mother.  Before we even attempt to complete such a task, we must ask the Light for aid. I have seen the Light manifest itself nearby, in the form of Spirits floating by the shores of Golakka Hot Springs.  Come, I must speak with them, and ask them for aid. "
1882,Gorishi Grub,Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 10 Silithid Meat. ,"The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The hatchling's drawings seem to resemble various types of large insects, perhaps the gorishi silithids. The hatchling finishes his picture, then gestures at it with one short arm, snaps its jaws, and licks its lips. It must want you to go to the Slithering Scar, in the center of the southern part of Un'Goro Crater, and gather silithid meat. When you have the meat, feed it to your hungry hatchling. "
1883,Speak With Spraggle,Speak to Spraggle Frock in Marshal's Stand. ,"My good friend Spraggle has been fretting about something for some time now.  I'd help her, but as you can see, I'm pretty comfortable right now. Could you check in with her and see what she needs? "
1884,Blazerunner,Kill Blazerunner. ,"I'm still a bit concerned about these fire elementals, <name>.  One last request: head to the top of Fire Plume Ridge, and kill the one they call Blazerunner.  He's the biggest and strongest of all the fire elementals in the crater.  With him gone, I'll be able to sleep much better. "
1885,Here Lies Dadanga,Obtain 10 Bloodpetal Sprouts. ,<You almost sense an air of gratitude as you place the Bloodpetal sprouts on the grave. >
1886,The Northern Pylon,Discover the location of the Northern Crystal Pylon in Un'Goro Crater. ,"You've done us a number of favors, <name>. . . now let Gremix do one for you.  The attacks on Marshal's Refuge were terrible, undoubtedly.  They came without warning, and took no prisoners.  They were lucky that so many of them survived. A few weeks ago, I came across a crystal pylon in the cliffs to the northeast of here, east of Marshal's Refuge.  I think the pylon and the attacks may be related somehow.  Maybe you can investigate?  I'm sure someone in Marshal's Stand will thank you. "
1887,Volcanic Activity,Collect 9 samples of Un'Goro Ash from the fire elementals around the volcano in Un'Goro Crater. ,"Welcome.  I'm Williden Marshal, and my sister and I run this expedition of explorers and scientists.  You have a moment? I don't like the look of those elementals on that volcano, <class>.  We have too much equipment, too many notes. . . one crazed elemental could streak its way through our camp and do terrible, terrible damage. Show them that their new neighbors aren't to be trifled with.  And bring back the ash that they leave behind. . . we might as well do a little science while we're at it. "
1888,Marshal's Refuse,Obtain 10 Discarded Supplies. ,"A big part of making money is shamelessness.  You have to be willing to profit off of the misfortune of others.  It all ends up boiling down to one question: How much do you love money? When Marshal and his crew abandoned their refuge up to the north, they left behind lots of supplies.  This stuff isn't rare, or even particularly valuable, but it's there if you're willing to take it.  His camp is up in the cliffs, to the north. Oh, and be on the lookout for whatever it was that made them leave. . . "
1889,Searing Roc Feathers,Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to get 5 pieces of Searing Roc Plumage. ,"The hatchling looks at you for a moment, almost as if wondering whether you'll understand. It scrawls a picture of a pair of feathers in the dirt, then points with one claw to the bindings at its elbows and knees. It doesn't seem hungry, but what could the feathers be for? It must want them for adornments like the ones you've seen on other raptors. The largest feathers come from the searing rocs that congregate around the bones of large creatures in western Tanaris, northeast of Thistleshrub Valley. "
1890,Peculiar Delicacies,Obtain 96 Silithid Legs. ,"Hey <bub/sweetie>, interested in making an extra dime? I've got it on good authority that some interested parties are paying BIG money for silithid legs.  Yes, you heard me right, silithid legs!  Apparently these things are delicious if you cook them right.  They're like underground lobsters, and they live just south of here. Thing is, I'll need a good amount of them to pay for my overhead.  Think you could get me 8 dozen or so? "
1891,Hard to Harvest,Obtain 4 Tarblossom Blossoms. ,"The Lakkari Tar Pits, just north of here, conceal a hidden treasure: rare flowers that grow at the bottom of the pits.  These tarblossoms, as they're called, are valued for their beauty and their durability.  It's been a while since I last harvested tarblossoms, so there should be some new plants growing at the bottom of the pits.  Grab some for me? By the way, good luck swimming in tar.  It's nothing like swimming in water. "
1892,"Hungry, Hungry Hatchling",Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 15 pieces of Fresh Dinosaur Meat. ,"The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The drawings are rough, but you can make out the shapes of diemetradons, stegodons, and pterrordaxes. As the raptor finishes the sketch, it looks up at you, bares its teeth, and makes a biting motion. Your venomhide hatchling must be craving fresh meat from these animals. Find and kill any type of diematradon, stegodon, or pterrordax in Un'Goro Crater and feed its meat to your hungry hatchling. "
1893,Claws of White,Obtain 5 White Ravasaur Claws. ,"Stop, <race>.  I could use the help of a <class> like you. Right outside this camp, there are raptors with deadly claws.  I've been using the claws for druid rituals, but it doesn't seem to be working.  However, I did notice that some of those raptors sometimes have white claws, when most have deathly black ones. The earth works in strange ways.  Maybe you could fetch me some of the white claws, and I'll try one last time? "
1894,Venomhide Eggs,Bring 4 Venomhide Ravasaur Eggs to Mor'vek in the southeast part of the Marshlands. ,"Now that you've built up an immunity to venomhide toxin, you can safely handle the animals and their eggs. Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch. If you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests. Look for the eggs with lighter colored shells -- those are the ones that will hatch venomhides. If you bring me several of the eggs, I'll allow you to keep one and raise its hatchling, with my guidance. "
1895,An Important Lesson,Speak to Maximillian of Northshire to learn more about becoming a squire. ,"What ho, traveler!  You must know that you set foot upon the camp of Maximillian of Northshire!  Mayhap you have heard tales sung of my many exploits?  I can see from the look in your eye that you have.  That glint of recognition plays upon your visage like the White Lady's reflection o'er Stonecairne Lake. It is clear to me that you seek adventure.  As you seem able enough, and thoroughly well-intentioned, I would offer to make you my squire. "
1896,A Tale of Two Shovels,Kill Durrin Direshovel and obtain Durrin's Archaeological Findings. ,"Hey wait a minute, this bone has pickax marks on it.  These aren't yours, are they?  No, I recognize this mark. . . this must be that blasted dwarf!  Gah! Let me step back for a minute and explain.  There's another archaeologist south of here named Durrin Direshovel.  He practices a reckless, devil-may-care brand of archaeology that offends even me. A priceless fossil, ruined by sloppy pick-work.  This is the last straw, Durrin! <name>, go put an end to Direshovel and his negligent excavation. "
1897,Shizzle's Flyer,Collect 35 Webbed Pterrordax Scales. ,"I'm making a flying machine! I got stranded here, and I'm absolutely horrible at finding my way around. I'd take a gryphon or wind rider back to Gadgetzan, but those beasts just scare me to death. So, will you help me? All I have left to build is the wings, and I was thinking that the webby scales from the pterrordax in the Screaming Reaches to the west would be perfect. There's no way I'm going to go up against one of those, but you look pretty tough. Why don't you give it a try? "
1898,The Evil Dragons of Un'Goro Crater,"Help Maximillian of Northshire slay 15 ""Dragons"". ","This crater is filled with a malignant breed of dragon.  Have you seen them?  They wander all about, parading their spiky backs and lizardy faces all around the Crater. Don't let them fool you, squire, for these dragons are no minions of graceful Alexstrasza.  They are clearly vicious, and direly in need of a hero's blade. I have decided that I will slay no less than 15 of them.  As my squire, you must come along.  Should we become separated, you may meet me back here at the Hot Springs. "
1899,The Fare of Lar'korwi,Find the carcass of Lar'korwi's freshest kill and steal a Piece of Threshadon Carcass. ,"Once, a long time ago, a brother of mine took some meat from one of Lar'korwi's kills. He didn't know it at the time, but Lar'korwi saw him from the forest. Lar'korwi followed my brother for days, destroying everything he touched. My brother, scared, finally decided to run from the Crater and leave Lar'korwi behind. Lar'korwi killed him not far from this spot. If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it. Start your search to the west. "
1900,The Apes of Un'Goro,"Bring 2 Un'Goro Gorilla Pelts, 2 Un'Goro Stomper Pelts, and 2 Un'Goro Thunderer Pelts to Gremix at Mossy Pile. ","There's plenty of money to be had here in Un'Goro, you just need to know where to look! Apes may be common here in Un'Goro, but they're much rarer up north.  In Everlook, a gorilla hide fetches ten times what you'll get for it down here! I'm not going to send you all the way up to Winterspring - that'd be irresponsible - but I could use your help actually obtaining some hides. You'll find gorillas at Fungal Rock, to the northeast, near a waterfall.  Don't forget to check inside the cave! "
1901,Super Sticky,Collect 8 samples of Super Sticky Tar. ,"I'm always looking for a quick way to earn a gold, <name>. If you help me with my newest idea, I'll let you in on a little of the profit. How does that sound to you? I thought so! We're going to be making some glue. Head to the tar pits just north of here, and collect me some tar. Not just any tar, now, you'll need to get it from the beasts that live around the tar pits. As a bonus, if you use my tar scraper on their corpses, you'll keep your hands nice and clean. "
1902,Tropical Paradise Beckons,Report to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand in Un'Goro Crater. ,"Hey, you look like a discriminating adventurer.  Are you looking for something different?  Something exotic?  Something. . . profitable? Well shake the sand out of your boots, because I've got a proposition for you. Williden Marshal is looking for competent sellswords such as yourself.  He's set up camp at Marshal's Stand, just southeast of the volcano in the center of lush Un'Goro Crater. Then again, paradise isn't for everyone, <race>.  It's up to you.  Your tropical oasis awaits. "
1903,Roll the Bones,Obtain 8 Dinosaur Bones. ,"You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging.  There might be worse things to do in this world. . . but none really leap to mind. We were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons.  Well, there are plenty of live ones there too!  Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones.  Between you and me though, bringing some from live ones will work out just as well. "
1904,Carried on the Waves,Use Garl's Net to obtain 4 Bloodpetal Seeds. ,"The Bloodpetals of Un'Goro have a fascinating life cycle. These trees in front of us bear seeds that fall down into the river when they mature.  The river's current then takes the seed north of here, where the seed hatches - almost like an egg - and a newborn Bloodpetal emerges. I require these seeds for my studies.  Take this net, and use it to scoop up the bright orange seeds in the river.  You'll have to hunt them down under the water. "
1905,Chasing A-Me 01,Find A-Me 01 at Fungal Rock. ,"Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions.  You've seen mechanical squirrels, yes?  Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01. She has been studying the local wildlife at Fungal Rock for several months, but she should have returned by now.  I fear the worst for her. Can you help me find her? "
1906,Crystal Spire,The Pylon table allows you to combine blue power crystals with yellow power crystals. ,"Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors. As you push the last one into place, a burst of light fuses the crystals together. The resulting combination is now yours. "
1907,The Western Pylon,Discover the location of the Western Crystal Pylon. ,"Durrin's research touched on one area that intrigues me: a potential link between the titans and the dinosaurs. J. D. Collie back at camp is always talking about titan this and crystal that. . . maybe she'd be interested. Before you report to her, you might want to check out the crystal pylon not far from here.  It's just up in the cliffs, to the west of here.  It's got crystals on it, and it always seemed to me like it might have something to do with the titans. "
1908,Bouquets of Death,Kill 6 packs of Juvenile Lashers. ,"You're already familiar with the first phase of the Bloodpetals' life cycle: the waterborne seed.  The next phase, however, is not so docile: the pack of juveniles. When Bloodpetals hatch, they quickly form gangs and travel together, offsetting their weakness with overwhelming numbers.  These packs of young lashers normally keep to themselves, but upset one of them and you upset them all. For our safety and the safety of others, dispose of them.  They roam close by, to the west and north. "
1909,Finding Stormclaw,Report to Garl Stormclaw at the entrance to Un'Goro Crater. ,"Zen'Aliri been studyin' the ways of the druid, <race>.  Hopefully one day, Zen'Aliri join the Druids of the Talon, and soar over this crater as a storm crow. But for now, my mentor says I stay here and wait.  So Zen'Aliri waits. I know another druid who might be able to use your help.  His name is Garl Stormclaw, and he's somewhere to the east of here, studying reagents.  Maybe you go talk to him? "
1910,Hero's Call: Un'Goro Crater! ,Report to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand in Un'Goro Crater. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand. The Alliance needs you to provide support to the Marshal Expeditions as they uncover the secrets of Un'Goro Crater 's ancient beasts, unique flora, and powerful crystals. You can reach the crater by departing western Tanaris and following the road all the way to Marshal's Stand. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
1911,Aberrant Flora,Kill 11 Bloodpetals. ,"Look how strangely the plant life reacts to the bloodpetals in the Roiling Gardens to the north.  The trees are enveloped with more flowers and vines than usual.  Large, sporous blossoms project themselves from the ground where they once did not. The land is speaking to us, <race>.  The bloodpetals are destroying the balance. As my final task, I ask you to visit the swarming adult bloodpetals and prune their numbers. "

1913,Is This Stuff Still Good? ,Return the Crate of Foodstuffs to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand. ,"You find what appears to be a crate of food, left behind when this camp was abandoned.  On the outside of the crate, you can make out a stamp that says ""PROPERTY OF MARSHAL EXPEDITIONS"". Perhaps you might find someone who could use this? "
1914,The Fledgling Colossus,Kill the Gorishi Fledgling Colossus. ,"If you're here to help, then maybe you can help us with a lurking threat. To the south lies the Slithering Scar, a quivering silithid outpost in the middle of the jungle.  You can't miss it. One of my scouts reports that the silithid are harboring a young colossus in their large central underground chamber, and once it is fully grown, they plan to unleash it upon Un'Goro! This must not be allowed to pass, <name>.  Find the colossus and kill it. "
1915,Serving A-Me 01,Bring A-Me's Thumb Drive back to Karna Remtravel at Mossy Pile in Un'Goro Crater. ,"Greetings.  I unit A-Me 01.  You. . . <race>? A-Me's mission to study the local gorillas was success.  A-Me has gathered data that Karna needs. A-Me 01 not returning, though.  A-Me has new family now.  Here, with the gorillas, A-Me stay. < A-Me 01 detaches a small device from her hand and gives it to you. >You bring data back to Karna.  You tell her what happen. "
1916,An Abandoned Research Camp,Return the Research Equipment to Hol'anyee Marshal at Marshal's Stand. ,"You find what appears to be a piece of research equipment, left behind when this camp was abandoned.  Chiseled onto the side of the device are the words ""PROPERTY OF MARSHAL EXPADISHUNS"". Perhaps you might find someone who could use this? "
1917,Crystal Restore,The Pylon table allows you to combine green power crystals with yellow power crystals. ,"Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors.

1918,Gormashh the Glutinous,Kill Gormashh and obtain the Unbelievably Sticky Tar. ,"Hey, I know!  We've been looking at the wrong tar creatures. Gremix once told me about a larger-than-normal tar creature that he ran into.  It lurks around the tar pit far to the east of here, south of Fungal Rock.  I'll bet that the bigger these creatures get, the stickier they get!  We'll make some money yet, <name>! Don't forget the scraper! "
1919,Mossy Pile,Report to Gremix at Mossy Pile. ,"Here in Marshal's Stand, I can't really do too much profiteering without arousing suspicion from the scientists.  There is, however, another place where I might have use of you. My business associate, Gremix, has a camp northwest of here, on the opposite side of the volcano.  He's a savvy business mind, and has a better eye for profit than even I do.  I'm sure he could put you to work, if you'd like to make some more coin. "
1920,Flowing to the North,Report to Ithis Moonwarden in the Roiling Gardens. ,"Ithis Moonwarden is the night elf druid who indoctrinated me into the Cenarion Circle.  He has set up camp north of here, near the cliffs of the crater's easternmost edge.  Follow the flow of the Bloodpetal seeds, and I'll wager you'll find him nearby. My studies are limited only to seeds and other reagents, but he pursues more advanced matters.  If you are curious to learn more about Un'Goro's flora, you should speak with him now. "
1921,The Mighty U'cha,Bring U'cha's Pelt to Gremix at Mossy Pile. ,"Looking around, you see bits of red fur laying around this part of the cave.  It appears to match the consistency of gorilla fur. Based on your conversations with Gremix, you know that he would almost certainly be interested in a red gorilla hide, if you were to obtain one. "
1922,Crystal Force,The Pylon table allows you to combine green power crystals with blue power crystals. ,"Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors. As you push the last one into place, a burst of light fuses the crystals together. The resulting combination is now yours. "

Oh, I just remembered!  I have a friend nearby that might be able to use your assistance.  His name is Spark Nilminer, and he's Marshal Expeditions' chief archaeology officer. He's been sent out to Golakka Hot Springs, to the west.  You'll likely find him on the springs' western shore. "

1931,Sarkoth,Kill Sarkoth and bring his claw back to Hana'zua. ,"<class>! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg.

I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south. "
1932,Hana'zua,Find Hana'zua in the Valley of Trials. ,"Hey mon, take a knee and hear me out. We got a problem.

A good friend of mine, Hana'zua, has gone out into the valley and he hasn't returned. Last I seen, he was headin' north, where the scorpids hunt. Maybe you go take a look for him? The spirits be tellin' me that he's not well. "
1933,Your Place In The World,Speak with Gornek. ,"Finally, you are of age, <name>. . . of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief.

Yes. . .

< Kaltunk looks you over. >

You will do nicely.

No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less. . . dangerous.

< Kaltunk laughs. >

Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young <class>. You will find him seated at the fire behind me. "
1934,Vile Familiars,Kill 8 Vile Familiars. ,"I trust the Valley of Trials will teach you much, young <class>.

I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here. . .

One of the Burning Blade - a foul, demon-worshipping cult - has made camp here in the Valley of Trials. He skulks in a cave to the north, and his vile familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc.

As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me. "
1935,Galgar's Cactus Apple Surprise,Obtain 6 Cactus Apples. ,"It sure gets hot out here in the Valley of Trials.

< Galgar wipes his brow. >

If only I had some cactus apples, I could make my famous cactus apple surprise! Nothing cools you off faster than a piece of that delicious treat.

I'll tell you what, <name>. If you bring me six cactus apples, I'll make you a few portions of cactus apple surprise to take with you on your adventures. If you're interested, you can find cactus apples growing near the cactus plants around here. "
1936,Report to Sen'jin Village,Speak with Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village. ,"Your trials against the Burning Blade are finished. . . here in the Valley. But I want you to report your findings.

Go to the troll village of Sen'jin and seek out Master Gadrin. Sen'jin Village is east out of the valley, then right at the fork.

Tell Gadrin of the Burning Blade, and that they have reached the Valley of Trials. Discover from him if they have yet reached Sen'jin.

Go, <name>, and be swift. I fear the evil found in the Burning Blade Coven is but the herald of a larger threat. . . "
1937,Cutting Teeth,Slaughter 6 Mottled Boars. ,"The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead.

I believe you'll be of more use to us slaughtering the boars you'll find in the farms to the north and northeast of here. "
1938,Sting of the Scorpid,Obtain 8 Scorpid Worker Tails. ,"I must send you back into the fields again, <class>. You will find large numbers of scorpids northwest of here. Bring me eight of their tails.

The antidote for their sting is actually made from venom extracted from their stingers. We keep large quantities of antidote for scorpid venom on hand to heal young bloods just like you. . .

But I'm sure you won't be needing any of that, will you? "
1939,Back to the Den,Bring the news of Hana'zua's plight to Gornek in the Valley of Trials. ,"Seeing the deed you have done for me steels my heart. I cannot fall so easily! I must endure!

But it remains that I cannot make the trek back to our settlement unassisted. Please, <name>, return and tell Gornek of my situation. Perhaps he can help me. "
1940,Invaders in Our Home,Slay 7 Northwatch Scouts. ,"You're not just another grunt - you seem to be a serious <class>. Good, because that's exactly what I need.

Try not to let the word out, since I don't want to cause a panic. . . but there have been reports of more humans nearby. This is an egregious betrayal of the peace that we negotiated with that miserable Jaina Proudmoore! We can't allow humans here in Durotar, and especially not here in the Valley.

You will find them to the south. Slay them quickly, before their numbers increase any more. "
1941,Lazy Peons,Use the Foreman's Blackjack on 4 Lazy Peons when they're sleeping. ,"Cursed peons! They work hard gathering lumber from the trees of the valley, but they're always taking naps! I need someone to help keep the peons in line.

You look like the right <race> for my task. Here, you take this blackjack and use it on any lazy peons you find sleeping on the job. A good smack will get them right back to work! Return the blackjack when you're done.

Look for them underneath the trees in the valley. Lousy slacking peons. . . "
1942,Making Amends,"You must've done something really bad to us or our friends, &lt; name&gt; . ","Thank you, <name>. You're on a quick path to redeeming yourself with our fair town. "
1943,Winterfall Runners,Find and defeat the Winterfall Runner and take the Winterfall Crate from him. ,"Very interesting, <name>. . . When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater. We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment. "
1944,Words of the High Chief,Take the Crudely-written Log to Kelek Skykeeper at Lake Kel'theril. ,"The Winterfall are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the furbolg to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper. He's a druid that once worked to help cleanse Felwood with the Emerald Circle, and has since come here to study the nearby ruins. You might be able to find him to the east at Lake Kel'theril, where he spends his time recently. "
1945,Magic Prehistoric,"Obtain the Essence of the Claw-Totem, the Essence of the Life-Totem, and the Essence of the Moon-Totem. ","The owlbeasts' sacred caves are located to the east. Within several of these caves, you should find totems. I want you to approach these totems and gather whatever essence you can from them. The dreamcatcher should absorb this essence for use within Mazthoril. "
1946,Get Them While They're Young,Gather 8 Frostsaber Cubs from the dens around Frostsaber Rock. ,"I can teach you to ride a Winterspring frostsaber, but it takes time and dedication. For this to work, both saber and rider must be highly trained and both must share a bond of deep trust. The cubs are only receptive to this training if they're introduced to their riders at a young age. Some of the cubs in the dens surrounding Frostsaber Rock are at the proper age to begin their training. If you help me gather the most promising of those cubs, I'll allow you to begin training with your own cub. "
1947,Hero's Call: Winterspring! ,Report to Donova Snowden at Frostfire Hot Springs in Winterspring. ,"By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Donova Snowden at Frostfire Hotsprings. She requires your help to overcome the threat of the Winterfall furbolg. To reach Winterspring, you must travel east from northern Felwood and traverse Timbermaw Hold. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! "
1948,The Root of All Evil,Plant the Demon Summoning Torch in the mouth of Grolnar's cave in the Winterfall furbolg village. ,"<name>, thanks to you we have devised a way to summon forth the root of all evil for the Winterfall tribe - the corrupting demon that dominates them! Take this torch to the mouth of Grolnar's personal cave and plant it there.  Doing so will force the demon to reveal itself and investigate.  This is when you and your allies must strike it down!  Only the essence of the fallen demon will begin the lengthy healing process of the Winterfall tribe. . . and the salvation of Timbermaw Hold. "
1949,Hammer Time,Speak with Deez Rocksnitch. ,"The three of us have been arguing for weeks over whose weapons are superior. I won't let anyone tell me my maces are second best. Kilram's axes and Seril's swords could never match the pure strength of my craft. I'm tired of arguing. It's time to show those two I'm right with a demonstration. If you would, dear, head outside and tell Deez Rocksnitch that I need the biggest boulder he can find! "
1950,Ursius,Kill Ursius. ,"I've heard it said that you are what you eat. I don't know if I believe that, but if it's true. . . I'd prefer to eat the strongest creature that I can find. Ursius is the largest bear in Winterspring. He eats first when his pack of shardtooth brings down a chimaera or an owlbear. He claims the most comfortable cave in the shardtooth-held lands. And he has. . . considerable influence with the shardtooth females. He is my kind of bear. I want to eat him. His cave is near the maulers. Good luck! "
1951,Ice Delivery,Deliver the Instant Ice Block to Seril Scourgebane in Everlook. ,"Alright, one high-quality, pure grade Instant Ice Block! I tried selling these to people for protection for a while. Y'know, like that trick you see mages pull? Couldn't figure out the whole ""breathing"" thing, though. "
1952,Threat of the Winterfall,Slay 15 Winterfall furbolg of any kind near the Frostfire Hot Springs. ,"I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have. . . strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg. They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here. I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me? "
1953,The Final Piece,Bring the Crudely-written Log to Donova Snowden in Winterspring. ,"The log you found on the high chief looks extensive, but after looking through a couple of the pages, you find that you cannot read the text. The markings are so crude and poorly-formed that you are not sure if anyone would be able to read them. But perhaps Donova will be able to tell you what it says. . . "
1954,Winterfall Activity,Collect 10 Spirit Beads from Winterfall furbolg. ,"The Timbermaw tend to stay to themselves, <name>.  While we do allow safe passage to those we trust, we try to avoid other furbolg tribes if at all possible. The Winterfall tribe has become increasingly hostile towards us.  They seem to be in a state of rage, completely engulfed by their own fear and hatred of anything they do not understand. The Winterfall carry spirit beads, which have clearly failed to protect them against corruption. Bring me 10 of these beads to show you have thinned their ranks. "
1955,Shy-Rotam,Slay Shy-Rotam. ,"Time for the big kill, pal! Shy-Rotam lurks in the north, the largest frostsaber of them all. You should feel honored. There's no fiercer game for a hunter to match their skills against. . . and if you saw the cash I'm being offered by gourmands that want a piece of this fellow, your eyes would pop out! Once you've got her, head on back to camp. Don't want to totally exhaust our frostsaber population in one day. . . "
1956,Back with the Blues,Return to the Azure Archives. ,"It seems I had a good idea.

Now let us hope we can broach the subject of the Isles again. I am glad to see Haleh relaxed. She deserves it. "
1957,More Beads for Salfa,"You've certainly earned my trust, &lt; name&gt; , but you may need to continue to earn the trust of my untrusting tribe. ","Once again, you prove your honor to us!  I will make sure that your deeds are known amongst my kind. Remember to bring any of the Winterfall's beads you find to me.  For each set you continue to bring to me, I will speak on your behalf to the tribe. "
1958,A Bird of Legend,Slay Hell-Hoot. ,"Local legend tells of a mighty owl that circles the mountaintops like death on wings.  They named her Deathwing. Soon afterwards, they were told that that name was already taken.  So they settled on a moniker that evoked a similar sense of horror and dread: Hell-Hoot. Hell-Hoot can be found atop the mountain to the southwest of our smoking pit.  Silence the infernal nocturnal. . . so we can eat her! "
1959,Falling to Corruption,Find the Winterfall Cauldron at the northern Winterfall camp. ,"The aggression of the Winterfall furbolg has to have its source somewhere. I'd like to get to the bottom of it if I can! I've seen the furbolg in the camps to the north brewing something in a cauldron. They seemed very protective of it. . . if whatever they're cooking up is what's causing this, I must examine it myself. Find that cauldron if it's still there, and bring me back what's inside! "
1960,Strange Life Forces,Speak with Witch Doctor Mau'ari at the Snowden Chalet in Winterspring. ,"When this creature died, some sort of energy was released from its body. The energy was passed on to you, and now you feel somewhat stronger. According to Winterspring locals, Witch Doctor Mau'ari at the Snowden Chalet is an expert in the wildlife of the area. She might know something about this mysterious energy. "
1961,Chips off the Old Block,Slay 8 Frostmaul Tumblers. ,"My mysterious benefactors gave me more than one task. The second task took me farther south, to the Frostwhisper Gorge. I was surprised to learn that the gorge's bridge had been broken in two, preventing land travel from one side to the other. In addition, the juvenile Frostmaul tumblers were separated from their stronger adult parents. I thought that I could defeat them in battle. I was incorrect. I was forced to run away in shame. Teach these tumblers a lesson, <name>. Fight them, and win. "
1962,"Are We There, Yeti? ",Collect 10 Thick Yeti Furs from Ice Thistle Yeti. ,"My friends are always coming up with great ideas. I've never felt like I could match them. . . until today! I just drew up the plans for something great! If you promise not to tell, I'll let you in on the secret. . . I'm going to make a mechanical yeti! Not only are my friends sure to be freaked out when they see it, but when they get over that, I know they'll be impressed! I need thick yeti fur from the Ice Thistle yeti. There's plenty of them in the Ice Thistle Hills to the southeast. "
1963,Starfall Village,Speak with Wynd Nightchaser at Starfall Village. ,"You've been pretty busy around here. If you're still eager to do good deeds, or just get paid, I've got something you might be interested in. Starfall Village is just northwest of Everlook. The night elves there recently suffered a pretty nasty bug infestation, and they're asking for any help they can get. A few goblins from here already went there to start exterminating, but I'm sure there's room for more. Talk to Wynd Nightchaser, he'll fill you in. "
1964,Umbranse's Deliverance,Slay Umbranse the Spiritspeaker. ,"Umbranse lurks in the back of Mazthoril. His time has come. Unfortunately, I am unable to join you on this quest. While I'd love to get my hands on that snake, Mazthoril's magic would rip me apart in its current state. No, I need you to finish this for me. When the deed is done, use this charm. It will return you safely to the egress. "
1965,Artifacts Abound,Collect 5 Totemic Ruins from the Hidden Grove. ,"It is. . . certainly bizarre to see Sindragosa, real in all but the flesh.

Look, I appreciate that you have both come all this way for me. The Isles sounds delightful, but I have dedicated many years to cleaning up Winterspring. I am not about to leave a job unfinished. Magic is abound and unfortunately not all good.

If you would like to help, The Hidden Grove is next on my list. Therein lie ruins of totems that still emanate with some sort of magic. Will you collect pieces of them? "
1966,Fresh From The Hills,Collect 7 Pieces of Pure Glacier Ice from the cavern in Icethistle Hills. ,"Ice this time? Hoo boy, sure. I've got good news and bad news for you. The good news is there's a bunch of pure solid ice over in the Ice Thistle Hills cavern, straight east from Everlook. The bad news is there's also a bunch of vicious yetis in there. But if you can handle the yeti, hey, piece of cake! Just walk right up to the bigger chunks and crack 'em open with your weapon. Bring it all back to me and I'll do my thing. "
1967,Kilram's Boast,Speak with Deez Rocksnitch. ,"Pah! Crude and clumsy is all I see! You need more than just strength. My axes are just as strong as Lilith's maces, but so sharp, I can cut through a tree in one chop! You heard me, one chop! I'll prove it, too, here in front of everyone. Go ask Deez if he can get a tree in here! "
1968,Yetiphobia,Scare Legacki with Umi's Mechanical Yeti. ,"It's all ready, <name>! Now, I told my friend Legacki that I have a surprise for her. This is where you come in! I'm going to give you my mechanical yeti, and you'll get the honor of using it to surprise her. She's just on the other side of Everlook, near the inn. Go up to her and turn the yeti on. . . I'll be watching from here! "
1969,Legacy of the High Elves,Obtain the Memory of Zin-Malor from the spirit of Archmage Maenius. ,"One hundred years ago. . . I and a small group of other High Elves traveled here from our homeland, Quel'thalas. We sought the ancient mysteries of Kel'thoril. . . to find why it was destroyed. We found fragments in the ice, shards of the crystal. The Archmage we accompanied did not take long to fall under their sway. In our foolishness, we noticed too late. His spirit wanders in the southeast, among those he drove to madness, still clutching the memory of the precious shard. . . "
1970,Delivery for Donova,Deliver Salfa's Basket to Donova Snowden in Winterspring. ,"Donova Snowden is a kind dwarf who frequents the nearby hot springs. She claims to be studying their magical properties. She is a kind person and has good relations with our tribe. As the Winterfall have become more and more aggressive, she has begun researching the cause of their corruption. I must keep my post here, but I have made a basket of refreshments for her. Please take it to her for me and tell her we await her next visit. "
1971,The Ruins of Kel'Theril,Speak with the Kaldorei Spirit at Lake Kel'theril in Winterspring. ,"At this lake, the Crystal of Zin-Malor was stolen by the Highborne. The crystal was a powerful artifact that bent arcane magic in wild and unpredictable ways. . . but it could only be held by the worthy, and brought doom upon all others. The spirits that wander here span generations, each shackled here by Zin-Malor. Some will speak and tell their fates. Should you wish to learn the fate of Zin-Malor, seek the spirit at the center of the lake. . . "
1972,Rubble Trouble,Collect 6 Prime Rubble Chunks from Frostshard Rumblers. ,"If you want to get a boulder in there, you can use my own patented Boulder-in-a-Box! Normally I'd just sell you one up front, but I'm fresh out of materials. Earth elementals have been popping up on the peak directly south of town. They're a good source of rubble. If you bring me back a good amount, I'll pay you for the restock, and I'll throw in a Boulder-in-a-Box absolutely free! "
1973,The Perfect Horns,Obtain Icewhomp's Pristine Horns. ,I can't make a yeti without horns! I've been looking for what seems like forever for the perfect set of horns. . . and no horn I find is good enough! But just the other day I saw the biggest yeti in Winterspring. I named him Icewhomp. His horns are the ones I've been looking for! He lurks all the way in the back of the cave along the eastern ridge of Ice Thistle Hills. Bring me his horns. . . but be sure to check on Echo Three along the way! 
1974,Winterwater,Obtain 7 Winterwater from Ice Avatars in Frostwhisper Gorge. ,"I don't want our gambit to fail, <name>. Such a failure would only draw attention to our efforts, giving Umbranse an opportunity to hone his defenses. No, we have to do this right the first time. The Frostwhisper Gorge, to the south, provides us access to powerful ice elementals. The water within these elementals' hulls should amplify the power of your dreamcatcher, ensuring our efforts. Obtain this water, <name>. Then return to our small camp. "
1975,Warchief's Command: Winterspring! ,Report to Donova Snowden at Frostfire Hot Springs in Winterspring. ,"All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Donova Snowden at Frostfire Hot Springs. Her discoveries about the Winterfall furbolg may be the key to dealing with this threat once and for all. To reach the Frostfire Hot Springs in Winterspring, you must travel east from northern Felwood and traverse Timbermaw Hold. Destiny calls! "
1976,High Chief Winterfall,Slay High Chief Winterfall. ,"The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but if their leader is slain, they may not get any worse. Head east again, past where you found that cauldron. High Chief Winterfall is here, at the easternmost part of Timbermaw Post. "
1977,Chop Chop,Collect 10 pieces of Fresh-Cut Frostwood from Frostleaf Treants. ,"I deal in small timber plenty, but full trees? That's a novelty item. Kinda like those boulders. Maybe you can do me another favor. Just west of town there's a grove of trees overlooking Lake Kel'theril. I don't know if it's the spooks there, or all that elf magic junk strewn around the place, but we've been getting treants and lashers wandering around there recently. They're making it a real pain to chop wood over there, so why don't you chop some of them? Bring the wood from the treants back here. "
1978,You Gotta Have Eggs,Obtain 40 Chillwind Eggs. ,"I don't have a very discerning palate, but even I can't stand the taste of those chimaeras that you'll find around here.  Their eggs, however, are a different story. Chimaera eggs are the richest, most buttery eggs you'll find this side of Orgrimmar.  Way better than boring owl eggs, and not as sulfurous as those weird wildkin eggs. I'll take as many of them as you can gather.  Head northeast, and look for their nests in the snow. "
1979,Pain of the Blood Elves,Slay 7 Wretched Spirits or Wretched Spectres at Lake Kel'theril. ,"One year ago. . . The legend of the Crystal of Zin-Malor reached Silvermoon, and I led a group of the finest warriors and scholars available to this land. We brought ample mana crystals, so none of us would be tempted to taste the crystal itself. The crystal did not need our hunger to ruin us. Once in our possession, it warped all but me into wretched beasts. The wretched souls still wander, seeking more lives to chain to this lake. Will you give them mercy. . . or flee to die on safer ground someday? "
1980,Seril's Boast,Speak with Deez Rocksnitch. ,Brutes and amateurs. It doesn't matter how sharp or heavy your weapon is if all it's good for is hacking like an ogre. I could go on and on about finesse and speed and balance and control. . . but it's easier to one-up these fools. Tell Deez we've got one more order for him. I need a block of ice. 
1981,Spray it Forward,Bring the Box of Bugkill Fumigators to Remma Curtainfire inside the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den. ,"My fellow siblings are already further down in the den trying to deal with these bugs, and they're starting to get overwhelmed. I say it's time to gas the place. Take these fumigators. Don't go setting them off yourself; it takes a highly trained professional, and proper timing. Just find my sisters and pass them out. Remma should be positioned closest to the entrance. Head down the corridor and  keep to your right once you go down the ramp. "
1982,Trailing the Spiritspeaker,Report to Nymn at Everlook in Winterspring. ,"I have heard tales of Umbranse, though I have not ever met him in person. Rumor has it that he's been collecting magical artifacts, though for what purpose, I couldn't say. Best pass this information on to a trusted ally. Nymn, the high elf, can be found within Everlook, the large goblin town to the northeast. Tell him all that we learned today. "
1983,Pride of the Highborne,Slay 8 Anguished or Suffering Highborne. ,"Ten thousand years ago. . . The Highborne lived here in prosperity. We considered ourselves above the common ranks of the other night elves. With our every need met by magic and wealth, we led lives of indulgence and amusement. And greed. . . The spirits you see here are overwhelmed with remorse and regret. Their anguish chains them here. If you wish to learn more of Kel'theril and Zin'malor, free them from their agony. "
1984,The Arcane Storm Within,Use the Empowered Dreamcatcher to close 5 Arcane Tesseracts within Mazthoril. ,"Mazthoril's innate magic can wreak unimaginable havoc if mishandled. Umbranse's wanton casting within the cavern has opened up a number of tesseracts - in other words, portals - connecting to other worlds. If I am to return to Mazthoril, these tesseracts must be closed. The dreamcatcher will close the portals, buying you safe entrance into Umbranse's lair. First defeat whatever comes out of the tesseracts, then use the dreamcatcher to quickly close them, before anything else spills into this world. "
1985,Mystery Goo,Report back to Donova Snowden with your findings. ,"The greenish substance inside the cauldron is putrid and viscous.  No matter what it is, it doesn't seem to be good. It would be best to report back to Donova with your findings, along with a sample of the liquid in the cauldron. "
1986,Boulder Delivery,Deliver the Boulder-in-a-Box to Lilith the Lithe in Everlook. ,"Here you go, as promised! One Boulder-in-a-Box. Lilith was asking for this, wasn't she? She's my only customer! "
1987,A Taste for Bear,Kill 15 Shardtooth bears. ,"Have you ever had the luxury of trying bear meat? I never had the chance to try it in Gilneas, but the bears here are simply exquisite. The shardtooth bears that roam just to the south are well-marbled with fat from the cold here. I've been hunting them myself, and it's quite a lark, but I much prefer eating them! I recommend you try your hand at the hunt. Stick to the white-pelted shardtooth bears, and the Captain will go to field to bring back any you kill. "
1988,A Cub's Cravings,Gather 6 pieces of Shardtooth Meat from any of the Shardtooth bears in Winterspring and feed them to your Winterspring Cub. ,Your Winterspring cub looks at you and licks its lips. The little cat must be hungry and it's up to you to find a suitable meal for your charge. Rivern Frostwind mentioned keeping some shardtooth bear meat on hand for feeding his frostsaber cubs. Perhaps your cub would enjoy some fresh shardtooth meat of its own. Various kinds of shardtooth bears can be found all over Winterspring. 
1989,A Little Gamy,Kill 15 Shardtooth Maulers. ,"Many find the meat of the Shardtooth bears to be too gamy for their taste. I disagree, though I'm not one to judge the tastes of others. The Shardtooth Maulers, however - their brown-furred cousins, to the south - have much more tender flesh, particularly in their paws. And I've heard that the snout is also considered a delicacy. Continue your hunt, <name>. Let's see if you can bag those maulers for ol' Francis. "
1990,A Protector of Magic,Find Haleh in Winterspring in Kalimdor. ,"I am very curious about Haleh --she is one of the last living consorts of Malygos. I am grateful for her going to Malygos in his time of need.

I will admit, I have spent some time spying on her. She is a blue dragon through and through. Studious, proud, and one of the more careful ones around magic. 

I do feel most suited to be the one to visit her about the call of the Isles. Take my portal when you are ready. I shall meet you there. "
1991,Tree Delivery,Deliver the Super-Gro Insta-Tree to Kilram at the inn in Everlook. ,"Here you go, one instant Super-Gro Insta-Tree made with 80% natural ingredients! No roots, no muss, no fuss. Just give it to Kilram and make sure he stands the heck back when he uses it. "
1992,Descendants of the High Elves,Speak with the Sin'dorei Spirit. ,"Long after my death, my people would suffer an even greater mistake. The High Elves relied on the Sunwell and its glory. Never imagining a world without it, we would never make preparations to deal with such a fate. Later, when the Sunwell fell to the forces of the undead, what was left of my descendants would be lost and helpless. . . and the path they would take in response would change them forever. The Sin'dorei, still striving for redemption, would return here as well. . . "
1993,The Owlbeasts' Defense,Obtain an Owlbeast Dreamcatcher from Dun Mandarr. ,"What a shame. Whatever Umbranse has done, he has prevented me from undoing his magic. He is wiser than I had anticipated. I do have a backup plan, however. I have seen owlbeasts enter and leave Mazthoril, even after Umbranse took control. Their ancient druidic magic must be capable of disabling Umbranse's. Luckily, I happen to be somewhat of an expert in their methods. Travel south, to Dun Mandarr. You will find a chest with a dreamcatcher in it. That will be your first step. "
1994,Hunting Practice,Bring your cub near snow-covered burrows in northern Winterspring 5 times to help it learn how to hunt arctic hares. ,"Your Winterspring cub paws playfully at your hands. Without any playmates, the cub has few chances to practice its hunting skills. Perhaps you should take your cub hunting for the small arctic hares that burrow in the snow of northern Winterspring. Bring your cub close to the mounds of snow covering the hare burrows and wait for the cub's instincts to take over. "
1995,Altered Beasts,Obtain 5 Mana-Addled Brains from Altered Beasts. ,"We, the blue dragons, have been forced out of our home, Mazthoril. An impostor by the name of Umbranse has taken advantage of us in our weakest hour, and now occupies the cave. Mazthoril is a place of extremely potent magic, and he does not know how to wield it. Even the wildlife suffers. The beasts nearby have been altered. Please, <race>, I must ask you a favor. Gather their brains, so I can see if I can undo this Umbranse's wild magic. "
1996,Echo Three,Find Echo Three. ,"A lot of goblins have been going missing out there in Ice Thistle Hills. I was almost one of them! I had the idea to set up a sensor to tell us when the yeti were getting close to Everlook. Of course, it's not working either. There's yeti all over the hills and I haven't heard a peep from it. Would you mind checking on it for me? It might still be fixable. Echo Three 's set up to the southeast on the edge of Ice Thistle Hills. Don't ask what happened to Echo One and Two. "
1997,Turning the Earth,Use Tanrir's Overcharged Totem to overload 4 Winterfall Earth Totems. ,"Despite their corruption and madness, the Winterfall barely cling to their shamanic powers. It disturbs me to see the power of the elements used by them to harm my tribe and other innocents. We will turn their totems against them! Take my own totem with you into Winterfall Village. Use its powers on the Winterfall's totems from afar, and the fury of the earth will be unleashed on all nearby! Needless to say. . . keep a safe distance! "
1998,Spray it One More Time,Bring the Box of Bugkill Fumigators to Sana Curtainfire in the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den. ,"You'd think Rinno could have sent more than a single <race> down here to give us a hand! That freeloader. . . I'm gonna set this up. Head north from this room through the corridor and look for Sana. She's probably gotten herself lost in the last chamber, so check the side passages once you get there. "
1999,Spray it Again,Bring the Box of Bugkill Fumigators to Marcy Curtainfire inside the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den. ,"I'm gonna start setting this up. Next one goes to Marcy, further down the den. Head down this corridor here and look for her in the next main chamber. "
2000,'Borrowing' From the Winterfall,Obtain 6 pieces of Smoked Meat from either Winterfall furbolg camp in Winterspring and feed them to your Winterspring Cub. ,"Your cub looks at you expectantly. What could it want now? The little cat licks its lips. It must be meal time again! As the cub's surrogate <father/mother> you're responsible for providing meat until it can hunt on its own. But what if you let someone else do the hunting? The Winterfall furbolg of Winterspring usually have a lot of smoked meat on hand in both of their camps. Surely, they wouldn't miss a few pieces and your cub would get to try something new. "
2001,The Curse of Zin-Malor,Return to Kelek Skykeeper at Lake Kel'theril in Winterspring. ,"You have seen enough. Know that the Crystal of Zin-Malor brings only ruin to all around it. Leave this place, if you do not wish to join us. "
2002,Step Into My Barrow,Kill 10 Coldlurk Creepers and 5 Coldlurk Burrowers. ,"I've still got no clue where all these bugs came from. My best guess is the cataclysm stirred up some underground nests we never knew about. No use getting distracted with that when they need killing, though! "
2003,"Where There's Smoke, There's Delicious Meat",Find Jez Goodgrub at Goodgrub Smoking Pit in Winterspring. ,"Say there, <class>. . . do you like meat?  Even better, do you like money? I got a second cousin who's making a killing in the frozen meats business.  He's set up a smoking pit up north, and he's looking for help hunting all the dangerous beasties that always tend to taste so good. Carnivores pay well, friend.  I'm too heavily invested here in this barrow den - what was I thinking? - so I might as well pass the tip on to a helpful <race> like yourself. His name's Jez.  Head northeast, and look for the smoke! "
2004,Out of Harm's Way,Retrieve 5 Starfall Relics from the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den. ,"Luckily, when the infestation occured, no druids were slumbering in the western barrow den. It is still a sacred site to us, however, and its depths hold blessed relics kept there undisturbed for ages. While I am somewhat trusting of the goblin exterminators, I am also. . . familiar with the habits of their race. Please retrieve any relics you can find in the barrow den and bring them back to me so they are not damaged. They are within urns, nestled in the small alcoves throughout the den. "
2005,Owl of a Sudden,Test the Restored Owlkin Totem. ,"While you were working, I was inspecting the totemic ruins you retrieved. There has always been something odd about the Hidden Grove. It used to be occupied by a robust population of harmless white hares. Now there are only maddened owlkin and strange totems. . .

I put the pieces together. It is no masterpiece, but hopefully we can glean a stronger magical effect from the whole.

Maybe it will even make us sprout some feathers and fur. You would think as a blue dragon I would enjoy the cold, but no. "
2006,In Pursuit of Shades,Pursue and slay the Shade of the Spiritspeaker and obtain any evidence of its master. ,"You say it spoke of a master? Of one who holds Zin-Malor? This is grave news. You must act, <class>! I saw the shade fly off to the south. Take the path to the upper ruins, and you may be able to climb the frozen waterfall after it! And do not let your guard down. . . it may be waiting for you. "
2007,Bearzerker,Slay Grolnar the Berserk. ,"High Chieftain Winterfall's absence has done little to quell the rage of the Winterfall. In his absence, their greatest warrior has rose to a position of terrible power. Grolnar the Berserk lurks in the cave at the top of Winterfall Village, gorged on enough corrupt firewater to kill ten lesser furbolgs. He has become a bloated and horrible beast! Our warriors have been unable to face him. . . do you have the strength to defeat him, <class>? "
2008,Pride of the Dinner Table,Slay 15 Frostsaber Huntresses or Frostsaber Pride Watchers. ,"Alright kid, time to head out further into the field! This haul's nice and good, but further to the west you'll find much bigger kitties. The pride watchers and huntresses have a lot more muscle on them, and it makes AMAZING burger patties. They sell like crazy! Gimme a ping when you've cleared house and we'll see about you going after the main course. "
2009,Razor Beak and Antlers Pointy,Slay 12 Owlbeasts in Owl Wing Thicket. ,"What happened to me, you ask?  Listen, <class>, and listen well, for my tale is one of tragedy. . . I was sent here to Owl Wing Thicket to find some relics.  I only made it this far before I was overwhelmed by a flurry of wings and talons. How they roared and pecked, <class>! I now lay here, a broken orc, with nothing but vengeance on my mind. Please, <class>, if you have any sense of honor, you will go into Owl Wing Thicket and help me regain mine. "
2010,The Owls Have It,Slay 15 Winterspring Owls. ,"I've been eatin' owls my whole life. Owls is good eatin', and my friend Jez agrees. I was the first one that told him to sell owl! Mister fancy-pants worgen here says bears taste better, but don't pay him no mind. You should go hunt yourself some owl. There's plenty of 'em wandering just south of here. Stick to the gray ones for now, an' buzz me on the little talky-thing Jez gave you when you've racked up a few. "
2011,Fresh Frostsabers,Slay 15 Frostsabers or Frostsaber Stalkers. ,"Doesn't that smell great? My smoked meats get top dollar, and nobody else provides the exotic flavors I've got out here in the hills. And it's efficient; you just do the hunting for a small fee, and my other fine friends drag the beasts back here for skinnin' and smokin'! I've got the market cornered on Frostsaber meat right now. Absolutely delicious stuff, makes great sausages. Head out and hunt those cats just west of here, and we'll call that a start! "
2012,"Damn You, Frostilicus",Slay Frostilicus. ,"The Frostmaul giants wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for that damned Frostilicus. When the ground shook and the bridge broke, he and his fellow water elementals seeped out of the earth and took over the bottom of Frostwhisper Gorge, forcing the giants out. Damn you, Frostilicus! You would do me a great honor if you would send him back into the ground, <class>. You will find him to the south, at the bottom of the gorge. "
2013,Descendants of the Highborne,Speak with the Quel'dorei Spirit. ,"Not long after my death, the greed of my people would lead to their exile. A continent away, they would become Quel'dorei, the High Elves. In Quel'thalas they would bathe in the power of their Sunwell, and forget their legacy of desire and greed. These distant descendants returned here, drawn by the hand of fate, doomed to repeat history. Hear their tale now, as I have. . . "
2014,Test Subject,"Test the artifacts Bottled Spirit, Icy Book, and Left Boot. ","Today is day forty-one without finding a harmful artifact. I am further delighted to report that while you were away, a handful more proved harmless. Perhaps my hunt in Winterspring is almost concluded!

Come to think of it. . . you have some magical ability, don't you? Or enough bravery to help me test some more artifacts?

Do not be nervous. None of them will permanently hurt you. Artifacts with that kind of dangerous power were taken care of in my first year here. "
2015,Screechy Keen,Slay 15 Winterspring Screechers. ,"Them smaller owls are sure tasty, but Goodgrub says there's even bigger ones further south. Screechers, the folk around here call 'em. . . they make a heck of a noise when you tussle with them! But he says they're the best owls he's ever tasted or sold, and I believe him. Why don't you go rustle up some of those for us while I keep arguin' with Francis here? "
2016,Doin' De E'ko Magic,Obtain Rimepelt's Heart. ,"Mau'ari been makin' charms from da spirits of de wilds here for years now. Mau'ari just PLUCK de E'ko right outta de animals, and make charms for de kids, and de adventurers. Ovah to de east, dere be a tall hill surrounded by de shardtooth bears. Up on de hill be Rimepelt, de oldest bear in de woods. Mau'ari need dat bear for her magic. You bring me de bear's big ol' heart. "
2017,Scalding Signs,Collect 7 pieces of Suspicious Green Sludge from Scalding Springsurges or Boiling Springbubbles. ,"The cauldron looked like it contained concentrated material. If the Winterfall are diluting this stuff directly in the springs, contamination could build up over time. . . and then the dilution would be less and less effective. The spring to the northeast has boiled over with elementals. I thought it was because of the cataclysm, but their appearance could be a reaction to this. Could you check them for corruption? Hunt a few and bring me any bits of green foreign material they leave behind. "
2018,Cub's First Toy,Obtain a Tough Yeti Hide from any Ice Thistle Yeti and 5 Wildkin feathers. ,"The winterspring cub plays with a small tuft of fur from a large animal, batting the discarded hair about. While your cub looks like it's enjoying the new game, you wonder if it might get more enjoyment from a proper cat toy. With a little bit of leather from a yeti pelt and some feathers from crazed moonkin, you could make a respectable toy. You'll need a hide from the yeti in the Ice Thistle Hills southeast of Everlook and feathers from the moonkin at the Hidden Grove or Owl Wing Thicket. "
2019,Exterminators at Work,Speak with Rinno Curtainfire inside the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den. ,"The infestation of our barrow den occured nearly overnight. Vicious creatures never before seen in these lands swarmed the tunnels, hatching from unseen eggs. With the few of us here, it was all we could do to keep them from spreading outside the den. We were forced to hire goblins from Everlook that claimed expertise in extermination, but they have not yet been successful. If you wish to assist them, enter the barrow den to the west of this lodge and speak with Rinno Curtainfire. "
2020,The Pursuit of Umbranse,Report to Haleh at Beryl Egress in Winterspring. ,"We have isolated Umbranse's position here in Winterspring. It is as I suspected. Umbranse is at Mazthoril, the cavern that once belonged to the blue dragonflight, in the southwest. My mother, Haleh, will greet you there. She is stationed outside of the cave in a small camp with a few other survivors. Look for her campfire. "
2021,A Wyrm Rest,Work with Sindragosa to cheer up Haleh. ,Oh dear. I have an idea. Speak to me when you are ready.

2028,Proving Grounds,Travel to the Wildpaw cavern located southeast of the main base in Alterac Valley and find the Frostwolf Banner. ,"Hail, <class>. It has been a long time since we have had the chance to answer the call of battle. The old feelings are slow to rise but once awakened, the blood does rush. The battle rage returns. . . All newcomers to the Valley must first complete the rite of battle. Deep within the Wildpaw gnoll cave is a banner of the Frostwolf. Venture forth and recover the banner. Return it to me and I shall grant you the Frostwolf initiate's insignia. "
2029,The Graveyards of Alterac,"Assault a graveyard, then return to Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl in the Alterac Mountains. ","The battle lines of Alterac Valley are ever shifting.  Territories swing back and forth as we meet our opponents in deadly combat.  And graveyards, <name>, are where battles rage most fierce. I want you to attack an Alliance held graveyard!  Find a graveyard with an Alliance banner in its midst and pull it from the ground.

I was going through some ancient cosmology tomes when I stumbled upon a passage indicating that the prime naaru may have been created by Elune during the great ordering of Light and Shadow.

For this, we will need a power source brimming with fel energy. 

I know that the commanders of the Legion use powerful fel cores to control their warships. If you can defeat the commander of one of these ships, you should be able to take their core. "

2134,In My Father's House,Witness Illidan's Sacrifice in Azshara on the continent of Kalimdor. ,"Most mortals cannot comprehend the truth of the Legion. Those that recognize it, often refuse to accept its meaning. Such knowledge carries a weight that the mortal frame cannot bear. To sacrifice that much of ones self changes the soul.

I believe one such stone will help us draw out the Wrathsteed. 

Some Xorothian cultists have been spotted helping the Legion's efforts on the Broken Shore. It would be safe to assume their leader has one of Hel'nurath's stones.

2171,Into the Oculus,Talk to Archmage Khadgar when you are ready to travel to the Oculus. ,"I fear Kathra'natir is behind the attack on Meryl. We have little time to act. 

I suspect Archmage Vargoth's involvement is no coincidence. While it greatly pains me to destroy an archmage of his caliber and worse, someone I once called friend, we cannot permit his betrayal to stand unpunished. 

It is time to follow him into the Oculus. "

We need to bring news of this immediately to Archmage Khadgar. "
2196,Noggenfogger's Reasonable Request,Collect 20 Aethril. ,"Oh, the gall of that little green twerp! Marin Noggenfogger is blackmailing us. He says that if we do not meet his ""very reasonable requisition request"", he is going to close off access to the crucible.

Marin's asking for a hefty amount of Aethril. He said something about you recently holding a blade to his throat and that he's simply returning the favor.

Of course, if you would rather, I can eliminate him. "
2197,Dispersion of the Discs,Complete the trial to purge the excess energy from within the disc fragments. ,"These discs are radiating with power! It must be their proximity to one another. We must take them from here should they resonate further and cause a catastrophe in these sacred halls. I'll send them to the one place I know where we can reign their energies in, preventing any sort of explosion. I'm speaking of the Eye of Eternity. There we will be able to safely finish what Antonidas was unable to complete. Speak with me again when you're ready to leave. "

2202,Servant of the Windseeker,Speak with Highlord Demitrian in Silithus. ,"The elemental lords must be united,  but there has been no Windlord to lead the air elementals since the death of Al'Akir.

I know of the book in which you seek, but it does not want to be found. It is old and angry and thirsts for power. We will have to convince it to emerge from hiding in the proper way. Perhaps if you bring it a gift of nightwell energy from the nightborne elves in Suramar City it will be mollified. "

2209,The Imposter,"Grapple up the Lion's Rest cliffs, sneak through Stormwind City to the SI: 7 courtyard, and then kill Detheroc. ","Detheroc has SI: 7's finest snipers on all of the rooftops. We can't mount up and we can't fly. There are grapple points above so that we can move up the cliff. 

We've also setup hay bales to hide in along the likely routes to SI: 7. We just need to stealth in and kill Detheroc.

He's requested our assistance in tracking them down. If we have any hope of locating those mages, we'll need to find ourselves a reliable hound capable of following a scent.

2223,To Faronaar,Speak to Vindicator Boros along Old Coast Path. ,"We are keeping a close eye on Legion movements at Faronaar in Azsuna.

2264,Darkheart Thicket: The Nightmare Lash,Retrieve the Nightmare Lash from Darkheart Thicket. ,"The dark steeds of the apocalypse are indomitable creatures of anguish and cruelty. They can never be tamed. . . only subjugated. The next component of power we require is one born of hatred, fashioned within the Emerald Nightmare. It is known as the Nightmare Lash. The Nightmare Lash has the power to suffocate all hope. . . all light. . . from within a living soul. The Shade of Xavius himself carries the lash. Defeat him and bring the lash to me! I will use it to dominate the steeds of the damned! "
2265,On Daumyr's Wings,Ride Daumyr to the Broken Shore. ,"The time is nigh, $p. With these new dragons in our army, we are prepared for our assault on the Broken Shore. A large detachment of demons have appeared near one of our camps, and there are far too many of them for any of our allies to overcome. Who better to defeat these demons than those without fear of death? Those with quite the large secret weapon? Take Daumyr. We will meet you there. "
2266,Recruiting the Troops,Speak with Dark Summoner Marogh to summon ghouls. ,A powerful necromancer has joined the cause of the Ebon Blade. Dark Summoner Marogh has come a long way to us from deep within the realm of the Shadowlands. He will be a powerful ally of the Ebon Blade.

2267,Aggregates of Anguish,"Complete 5 ""Unholy Attainment"" missions. ",Our preparations for conjuring the Steeds of the Damned are nearly complete. Salanar the Horseman has given us a list of the remaining components. The ritual of conjuring requires five unholy essences known as the Aggregates of Anguish.

2268,The Scarlet Massacre,Slay 16 Scarlet Crusaders. ,"We have a single purpose here, to raise Sally Whitemane as a Death Knight of the Ebon Blade. Such is our goal and we will see it through. However, the Scarlet Crusade has terrorized the people of Azeroth long enough.

2269,Our Oldest Enemies,Collect 15 Witherbark Troll heads. ,"I will grant the Ebon Blade access to my father's tomb. First though, I must ask a favor. I have taken up the sword and banner of my father. I have reclaimed Stromgarde with its former citizens as my guard. Yet, one task remains. Witherbark invaders have blockaded themselves in the former mage district of the city. My men have suffered heavy losses at their vile hands. Cut them down to the last! Bring me their heads and I shall give you what you seek. You have my word as the King of Stromgarde. "
2270,Tech It Up A Notch,Speak with Archivist Zubashi in Acherus. ,"Archivist Zubashi has been doing a great deal of research on the necropolis we call Acherus. Through his studies on the necropolis, he has located a number of potential improvements that can greatly increase the power of the Ebon Hold. Speak with Archivist Zubashi now and he will show you what improvements can be made. "
2271,The Scarlet Commander,Slay High Commander Goodchilde. ,"There is only one more obstacle standing between us and the tomb of Sally Whitemane. High Commander Goodchilde guards the path to the tomb. Although he is a zealot and a murderer, he is still a hardened knight who has dedicated his life to the eradication of our kind. He should not be underestimated. . . Slay him and our work here will be nearly done. "
2272,We Ride! ,Lead the Four Horsemen in the battle against the Burning Legion. ,"The time has come, Deathlord! Our scouts have marked a large amassing of demons not far from here. Lead us to victory, and show these demons the power of undeath! "

<The presence fades. >"
2274,The King Rises,Raise King Thoras Trollbane as a Death Knight. ,"King Thoras was one of the greatest warriors this world has known. His people loved him and his enemies feared him. He only ever spoke truth, often saying the words others were afraid to speak. King Thoras lived a life of war and he certainly deserves the peace of death. But this is not a man who would sleep peacefully while the world around him burns. The time has come, Deathlord, to welcome the last true King of Stromgarde into the arms of the dead and damned. "
2275,Champion: Darion Mograine,"The Four Horsemen of the Ebon Blade are gathered together, but our work has only just begun. ","The Four Horsemen of the Ebon Blade are gathered together, but our work has only just begun. The Burning Legion has come to our world hungering for destruction, but we will feed them their own demise. Apocalypse awaits the demon invaders and we shall bring it to them!

The return of the Four Horsemen is at hand! "
2276,The Bonemother,Light Thorim's Beacon at Thorim's Peak to raise Daumyr. ,"It's time to call the mother, the true reason we came. She is strong, her sheer will and strength allowing her to face this peak in order to watch over the remains of her brood. While the Thorignir is a grand sight, I like my dragons a little more bony. She must die first. Remember the pyre where we met? She is its guardian, as the spirit was at the peak. If we light it, she will come. "

2279,Raising an Army,Raise 12 Festering Ghouls from the corpses of Scarlet Crusaders. ,We underestimated the number of scarlet crusaders still residing in the monastery. The battle for control of the cathedral is taking too long. It's time to take a more resourceful approach to the battle. . . Raise the fallen crusaders as ghouls and send them back into the battle against their brothers and sisters. The Scarlet Crusade will not be able to hold back the tide of undeath for long. 
2280,Plans and Preparations,Speak to Siouxsie the Banshee. ,"Your weapon is stronger than ever, but it will need many more souls in order to reach its true potential. Siouxsie has been collecting reports from the scouts, she will direct you to our enemies and their screaming souls will empower your weapon further. "
2281,"Rise, Champions",Recruit Nazgrim and Thassarian. ,"Your power is great, Deathlord, but power alone will not be sufficient. If we are to save this world from the onslaught of the Burning Legion, then you will need powerful allies. The Knights of the Ebon Blade are yours to command, it will be wise to make use of them effectively. Go and speak with Nazgrim and Thassarian. They will be of great use to you in the fight against the Burning Legion. "
2282,Called to Acherus,Speak with Siouxsie the Banshee. ,"Deathlord, your presence has been requested on Acherus.

Ebon Blade want to give you full set of armor to help with the little demon killing. Get stronger, make demons more dead! "
2285,Knights of the Ebon Blade,Speak to Korgaz Deadaxe. ,Korgaz Deadaxe has arrived at Acherus to aid us in recruiting additional death knights. He has an eye for potential. I cannot emphasize enough that it is of the utmost importance that we replenish our numbers during the battle with the Burning Legion. The demon armies are nearly endless and we are few. Speak with Korgaz when you are ready to recruit additional death knights. 
2286,The Peak of Bones,"Speak to Grimwing for a flight to Thorim's Peak, then meet Minerva. ","While you were gone, we strategized what to do with the harness. We can utilize its power to bind the spirits of deceased drakes to you, raising them under your will as loyal soldiers. I sent Minerva to Thorim's Peak in Stormheim, where she has found a brood of deceased Thorignir. They will be prime targets. Speak to Grimwing for a flight to the mountain, then Minerva will fill you in. "
2287,Our Next Move,Select your order's first assault point. ,"Have you seen the fog that surrounds us? The chill winds of Acherus have provided us with a perfect concealment from the prying eyes of the Legion! Under cover of this fog we've been able to send out scouting teams who've put together a fairly comprehensive map of the Broken Isles. Choose where we shall begin our assault. You, of course, shall have the honor of spearheading our efforts, but the rest of the Ebon Blade will follow your lead. "
2288,Troops in the Field,"Use the Command Table and complete the mission, ""Troops in the Field. ",It's time to send our newly summoned ghouls out into the field. Look at the Command Table and send your champions and troops on a routine scouting mission. 
2289,Harnessing Power,Kill Andjor Dragontamer and retrieve Rimefang's Harness. ,"These fools are using the power of Rimefang's harness to subjugate the frost wyrms. Their leader, Andjor, sits inside on the back of the broodmother and mocks us. He should breathe no longer. "
2290,Death. . . and Decay,Blight 10 Witherbark Supplies. ,My family has fought the Witherbark trolls for generations. . . their presence in Arathi has always been a curse upon the land. I want to drive them out of Stromgarde for good! Destroy their supplies and we shall give them no incentive to return. Blight their supplies. . . or whatever it is you death knights do to defile things. I care not. Just make sure that it is done! 
2291,From Bones They Rise,Revive 4 Deceased Thorignir in Thorim's Peak. ,"Alright, the job is to get the broodmother under our control. But hear me out. A few more drakes would be a boon, right? While we're here, why don't we use our awesome power over undeath to raise some of her brood as well? Although the peak has claimed their corpses for the ice, I'm sure the embrace of undeath will be much more welcoming. We must find their frozen corpses and breathe your will into them. "
2292,Champion: Amal'thazad,"Deathlord, I have been your humble tutor in the dark arts for some years now. ","Deathlord, I have been your humble tutor in the dark arts for some years now. From your birth at the hands of the Lich King, to your ascension as leader of our order, I have taken pride in watching you grow in power and undeath. I believe the time has passed in which my services as a teacher are necessary. Perhaps I would be of more use to you on the battlefield? The time has come for me to warm these frozen bones of mine in the blood my enemies. Please, allow me to be of service on the battlefield. "
2293,Return to Acherus,Return to Highlord Darion Mograine in Acherus. ,"You've grown a lot since we last met, <name>. Now that we have the harness, let's see if Mograine has a plan to use it. "
2294,Thorim's Flame,Convince the Drekirjar Shrine-Keeper to let you take Thorim's Flame. ,"Not too long ago, the Drekirjar and the Thorignir respected each other. This only changed when Skovald came into power. An ancient Drekirjar spirit watches over this peak, which seems to be a sacred graveyard of some sort. He is the keeper of the ceremonial flame, which happens to be exactly what we need to call down the broodmother. Why don't we go convince him to let us take the flame? I'm sure he'll be nothing but. . . amiable. "
2295,Severing the Sveldrek,Kill and raise 8 Sveldrek vrykul. ,"So here's the order of things, as far as I've been told. Mortal walks into Icecrown. Mortal is brutally defeated. Mortal gets raised as Scourge. These fools can't expect to trounce in here, do whatever they want, and leave without any consequence. Time to make them truly as mindless as they act. "

2299,Working With the Wardens,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the ""Working With the Wardens"" missions. ","As much as we might not like it, we need the aid of the Wardens if we're to locate the Sargerite Keystone. They took it from you when we were all imprisoned in the vault.

With Maiev missing, their current leader is Sira Moonwarden. On your behalf, I have agreed that we will assist them in tracking down some of the more powerful creatures that escaped from the Vault of the Wardens. In return, she will direct us to where we need to go to get the Keystone. "
2300,Preparations for Invasion,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the ""Preparations for Invasion"" missions. ","We have the Sargerite Keystone. We have most of the forces we will need. We even have a plan.

Now we need to locate the Felsouls and prepare for an invasion of whatever demon world they're hiding out on.

Please leave it to me. If you will grant me the use of your champions, I and the Scythe of Souls will extract the information by any means necessary from the demons that we question. "
2301,The Arcane Way,Locate Archmage Lan'dalock at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran. ,"Getting into the Black Temple is going to be tricky. Following the break-in by the Council of the Black Harvest, Akama had his Sha'tari priests erect a holy barrier. It prevents my teleportation.

However, I might know a way to bypass those protections and take us directly to the Temple Summit.

Long ago, I had a. . . liaison with a certain high elf wizard named Lan'dalock. He later joined the Kirin Tor.

If you were to ask him very nicely, and drop my name, I am certain that he would help. "
2302,Deal With It Personally,"Kill the Devouring Darkness in Highmountain, Hertha Grimdottir in Suramar, and Theryssia in Val'sharah. ","The way I see it, the Wardens owe us for all of those years we were imprisoned. Unfortunately, their new leader, Sira Moonwarden doesn't agree with my assessment.

Even though your champions have already dealt with several of their escaped bounties, she wants more. In fact, as a sign of good faith, she's asking that you deal with it personally.

You'll have to extinguish the flames of the kobold candles to summon forth the Devouring Darkness. The other two should be more straightforward. "
2303,Vault of the Wardens: Vault Break-In,Retrieve the Sargerite Keystone. ,"<All that is left now is to travel to the Isle of the Watchers off of southwest Azsuna. There, you will need to break back in to the Vault of the Wardens and descend down into its lowest recesses where once you were imprisoned. >

<Within the so-called Vault of the Betrayer, where the Wardens once held Illidan's corpse, the Sargerite Keystone awaits. >"
2304,Move Like No Other,Chase down the Sneaky Imp and recover the Grimoire of Arcane Ways. ,"Sorry about the holographic projection. . . I literally need to be in two places at once these days.

A holy barrier that protects against fel magic, you say? I have just the thing to bypass it and enable Malevolence's teleport.

<The high elf rummages around in his pack, a shocked look quickly coming over his face. >

Sneaky! Look there. . . that imp just made off with it! "
2305,The Crux of the Plan,Place the Sargerite Keystone above the Scouting Map. ,"We have Akama. Cordana Felsong has been eliminated. And, we have the Sargerite Keystone.

Everything is falling into place.

The honor is all yours, <name>. "
2306,Return to the Fel Hammer,Speak with Battlelord Gaardoun on the Fel Hammer. ,"<name>, Battlelord Gaardoun asked me to retrieve you. He says there is a very important matter that he needs your help with.

He requests your presence back on the Fel Hammer as soon as possible. "
2307,Jump-Capable,"Collect a Fel Engine Injector, a Soul Configuration Matrix, a Fel Engine Ignition, and a Vile Spirit Converter. ","While it is true that the Fel Hammer is powered, sadly, its jump engines are non-functional. If we are going to invade a demon world, we're going to have to make the command center jump-capable.

We need some replacement parts.

Luckily for us, the Legion brought a couple of command centers and soul engines along with them to the Broken Isles. You will find them at Faronaar in Azsuna, and at Felsoul Hold in Suramar. "
2308,Securing Mardum,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Securing Mardum"". ","There has been increased demonic activity below on Mardum. There are still demons leftover down there from when we first invaded.

To eliminate any threat to the Fel Hammer, it's time that they were destroyed. "
2309,"Loramus, Is That You? ","Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Loramus, Is That You? "". ","Belath Dawnblade has given us a strange scouting report from the Felblaze Ingress in Azsuna. The dreadlord, Razelikh the Defiler has returned to the world. That's not the odd part, though.

Strangely, he's sometimes going around killing the other demons and calling himself, Loramus!

Last we knew, our demon hunter brother, Loramus Thalipedes sacrificed himself to defeat Razelikh, whom he'd been possessed by.

Your champions and Ashtongue warriors need to go to Azsuna and find out what is going on. "
2310,A Final Offer,Investigate whatever is happening outside of the Fel Hammer. ,"What was that? Sounds like something's outside.

Something big. . .

2312,Two Worthies,Recruit Belath Dawnblade and Matron Mother Malevolence as your champions. ,"As our forces grow, and our reach extends ever outward, you have need of more trusted companions to handle the most important of missions.

The time has come for you to elevate two worthies into the ranks of your champions.

2313,The Invasion of Niskara,"Activate the Fel Hammer's control console and complete the scenario, ""The Invasion of Niskara"". ","Everything is in place. All systems are operational and we have plenty of fuel. The Fel Hammer's jump engines are ready.

2316,Power Outage,Refill the Fel Hammer's Power Core with fel energy. ,"Kor'vass asked for a bunch of other stuff, but it won't hurt her to learn a bit of patience. Don't you agree?

She did mentioned that the ship'ss weaponss array is severely damaged and dangerously low on power. Knowing her, I'm sure that'ss an exaggeration.

I suppose you may as well take this power core I confiscated. You can replenish it from those disgusting Legion geyserss and energy globess floating around the Tomb. "

2321,Green Adepts,"Speak with your Illidari recruiter, Ariana Fireheart. ","As much as I would love us to finesse our way to victory, the cold, hard reality is that we need more powerful forces.

We are already straining Gaardoun's ability to recruit more broken.

But now that we have Ariana Fireheart, she can train new demon hunters for us. "
2322,Leader of the Illidari,Head upstairs and take your place as the new leader of the Illidari. ,"Illidan has officially placed you in charge, <name>. The Illidari are now yours.

Meet me upstairs. We will let everyone know together. "
2323,Strange Bedfellows,Meet Malace Shade on the bridge at the Gates of Valor and then slay Lochaber. ,"The reason why I came out here was to capture or kill a fel lord named, Lochaber. I am no longer in a capturing mood.

I'll grab my weapon and then head up to the bridge in front of the Gates of Valor. That place is a scary mess full of Felskorn vrykul and demons.

How do you think I got caught?

So, I'd rather not go back in there. But, I think I know a way to get the demon to come out to us. "
2324,Back in Black,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Back in Black"". ","Before you head into the Black Temple, we need more information. The last thing we want is for you to teleport into a trap.

We must discern their force structure, patrol schedule, new defenses, and what Akama eats for breakfast.

<Belath grins. >

I suggest you send our broken warriors to handle this. They can blend in with the rest of Akama's Ashtongue forces inside the temple. We'll get what we need to know from the ones that make it back.

A champion handler or two can scout outside the temple. "
2325,Malace in Vrykul Land,Grab a flight from Aludane Whitecloud and find Malace Shade in Stormheim. ,"I did some recon in Stormheim. What I discovered is that the Tideskorn are a tribe of vrykul who have been cut-off from the sea by their kvaldir brethren. Many of the Tideskorn have pledged their services to the Legion and become Felskorn. Malace Shade was last seen heading toward the Felskorn Warcamp. It is likely that she was captured.

I have arranged a flight to Stormheim for you. When you are ready, you can use the gateway to travel to Dalaran and speak with Aludane Whitecloud at Krasus' Landing. "
2326,Taking Charge,Talk to Kyra Lightblade and choose to fly down to Mardum. ,"Mardum has been quiet for months. I wonder why the Legion is attacking us now? Could be in retaliation for destroying their battleship on the Broken Shore. . .

We had better head down ourselves and save the day, don't you agree? "
2327,Unexpected Visitors,Listen to your unexpected visitors. ,"Brace yourself, <name>. I am detecting a strange magic forming in the chamber. Something is projecting itself in. "
2328,Immortal Soul,Make the Blood Offering to complete the ritual and contact the soul of Illidan Stormrage. ,"Illidan's immortal demon soul is lost somewhere in the vastness of the Twisting Nether.

2329,War'zuul the Provoker,Kill War'zuul the Provoker. ,"There'ss some obnoxious demon lord up there who's been yelling for hourss.

I have taken the luxury of putting together a potential list for you. I do so hope that it proves helpful, <handsome/gorgeous>. "
2332,Into Our Ranks,Recruit the Shade of Akama and Kor'vas Bloodthorn as your champions. ,"We should make a show of welcoming this Shade of Akama into our ranks. It is important that the others see him treated as one of us, rather than as an outsider.

Kor'vas Bloodthorn has proven herself invaluable, time and time again. Her skills in combat are unquestioned and unparalleled. You will find no champion better suited to destroying our enemies.

It is time to officially raise them up as champions. "

2334,Demonic Improvements,Listen to Loramus Thalipedes' story and then upgrade your Class Hall. ,"Having Loramus back will work greatly to our advantage, despite the fact that he's trapped inside Razelikh's body. . . and also that the demon sometimes takes control.

2336,"Last, But Not Least",Recruit Allari the Souleater and Jace Darkweaver as your champions. ,"I think you already know what I am going to tell you. . . It is well past time to make Allari and Jace your champions.

The two of them were instrumental in the planning and preparation for the invasion of Niskara. They have earned it and you would be hard pressed to find better champions anywhere. "
2337,Direct Our Wrath,Select your first assault point on the Broken Isles. ,"We must seal the Tomb of Sargeras at all costs or the flow of demons will never cease. Until then, we must do what we can on the ground to alleviate their foothold before it grows further.

As soon as you're able, send your hunters to take care of the threats. "
2428,Azure Weaponry,Find Blacksmith Kyriel in Dalaran. ,"Take the materials to Blacksmith Kyriel in Dalaran, and he'll use them to craft whatever weapons he can.

As I mentioned before, he's skilled and efficient, so you shouldn't have to wait long.

When his work is complete, speak to Shandris Feathermoon about getting the weapons enchanted. "
2429,Walk This Way,Accept a gift from the Unseen Path. ,"<name>, your strength and leadership inspires awe in all of us!

The Unseen Path is prepared to furnish you with a full set of armor to aid in the fight against the Burning Legion. Continue expanding your influence across the Broken Isles, and we may yet achieve victory. "
2430,To Tame the Beast,Use the Leyworm Bait while in Felbeast Dens to lure and trap a felhound fledgling. ,"Deep in the heart of Faronaar are dens that are overrun with felhounds. If Hakkar is breeding those beasts, that is the place he would do it. The bait I've crafted is potent. Once you apply it, you'll draw the attention of nearby hounds, so only use it when you're close to the dens. Once the demon has taken the bait, get it into a weakened state to make trapping easier. Good luck, <name>. I hope you return in one piece. "
2431,Leyworm Lure,Collect Leyworm Entrails from worms within Leyhollow in Azsuna. ,"Felhounds are attracted to magic, young ones especially. They get a whiff and go into a feeding frenzy! You're not quite as enticing as a mage, so you'll need to cover yourself in something that can fool a felhound into thinking you're its next magical meal. Leyworm entrails should do the trick. "
2432,Soothing Wounds,Use Manaroot that is foraged from leylines within the Crimson Thicket to soothe D'Bynn's wounds. ,"< D'Bynn 's injuries prevent him from moving. >

Perhaps you can forage something nearby that will soothe the manasaber's wounds? "
2433,Making Contact,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Lenara Needs Help. ","Now that we have recruited champions for our order, we can use the Scouting Map to complete vital assignments across the Broken Isles. Over the years our scouts have kept a close eye on hunters that might one day be added to our ranks. One such hunter, Lenara, was on her way to Trueshot Lodge when she was attacked. I suggest that we send Loren Stormhoof on a mission to rescue her. He may be uniquely suited to this task. "
2434,Recruiting More Troops,Speak to Recruiter Sampson. ,"Our champions acquired the talents of Recruiter Sampson, an extraordinary tracker. He has a way with animals, calling them to his side with the utmost ease. In fact, he's already beginning to fill the stables with animals that he has tracked and tamed. Speak to him now. "
2435,The Scent of Magic,Follow Baron as he tracks the scent of the mages. ,"This is the last known location of the missing Kirin Tor. There isn't much evidence, other than a torn piece of cloth, which looks to be from one of our tabards. The scrap may be small, but it should be heavy with the essence of magic. We can only hope that Baron can catch the scent and track down the mages. "
2436,"Rise, Champions",Recruit Emmarel Shadewarden and Loren Stormhoof. ,"As leader of our order, other hunters will look to you for guidance. Many will be willing to pledge themselves to you, doing whatever is necessary in the name of the Unseen Path. I know of two within our ranks who are impressed with what they've seen from you so far, and want to help any way they can. Seek them out, and let them ease the burden of leadership. "
2437,Champion: Rexxar,"An old threat has resurfaced, stronger than ever. ","An old threat has resurfaced, stronger than ever. Azeroth needs hunters like you who are willing to survive at all costs. As the leader of the Unseen Path, many will look to you for guidance. Show them that they can survive. I will stand beside you, and together we will send a message that we can endure, even in the face of an enemy as great as the Burning Legion. "
2438,Ore Under the Sea,Mine Azure Ore from deposits found in the water off the coast of Suramar. ,"If we want to bring the fight to Hakkar, my rangers are going to need arrows and ammo that are capable of piercing the thick, magic-resistant hides of his hounds. There's a versatile smith in Dalaran who does incredible work with both bows and blades alike. He uses azure ore in his creations, which can only be found below sea level. Due to its proximity to leystone, the ore is often overlooked, but in an expert smith's hands, it can be smelted into something nearly indestructible. "
2439,Champion: Beastmaster Hilaire,I knew it was only a matter of time before us scouts would be called home. ,"I knew it was only a matter of time before us scouts would be called home. My post has been a quiet one over the years, without much to act on. Yet in recent times, I've seen the clans abandon their traditions in favor of following a king who chose to side with the Legion. The people I sought to protect, allied with my enemy. I will not let others find a similar fate. "
2440,Survival Skills,"Show your survival skill by building a campfire from chopped wood, and cooking a steak over an open flame. ","The life of a hunter should never be dull. Living in the wild you never know what will happen next, but you survive on skill and instinct. Show me you have the basic survival skills to live off the land. "
2441,Requesting Reinforcements,"Interact with the Scouting Map and complete the mission ""Requesting Reinforcements"". ",Many powerful factions have pledged their loyalty to the Unseen Path. It's time that we call on them to help us defeat Hakkar and his demon hounds. Send your champions into the field to track down these leaders and let them know we require their help. 
2442,Informing Our Allies,"Speak to Archmage Khadgar, Halduron Brightwing, Vereesa Windrunner, and Shandris Feathermoon. ","Leaders from some of the greatest military factions are here, ready and willing to help. They're currently waiting to speak with you directly, hoping to provide insight on how they can help. With any luck, we can pull our resources and find a way to take Hakkar down. "
2443,Missing Mages,Meet Archmage Khadgar in Suramar. ,"The Archmage has already made his way to Suramar, where the missing mages were last seen. Baron ran off, too. It seems that hound is eager to work again. Meet them both near the road that leads into the city. With any luck, Baron will be about to pick up on their magical scent and find the missing mages before it's too late. "
2444,Champion: Halduron Brightwing,You faced Hakkar with more strength and courage than I have seen in quite some time. ,"You faced Hakkar with more strength and courage than I have seen in quite some time. As Emmarel said, our battle with the Legion has only just begun. You can count on the Farstriders to be there when you need us. "
2445,Calling Hilaire Home,Find Beastmaster Hilaire in Stormheim. ,"With so many in need of our help, it may be time to call in some of our scouts in the field. One such scout is a huntress by the name of Hilaire. Although she abandoned her clan long ago to join our order, she still feels a need to watch over them. Her dedication to protect those who would shun her is admirable, but we need her here. Seek Hilaire out in Stormheim, and let her know it's time to come home. "
2446,Highmountain Salmon,Have you brought us supplies? A level 10 Quest. ,"Thank you, <name>. These salmon will help nourish our tribe. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(42929))"
2447,Signaling Trouble,Meet Emmarel at the top of the southern watch tower. ,"Long ago, we gave select leaders special flares that were only to be used in times of great need. Upon seeing the flare, the leader of the Unseen Path is supposed to head to the southern watchtower to meet with whomever lit it. I don't know who we'll face once we reach the tower, but we must move quickly. "
2448,Pledge of Loyalty,Return to Altar Keeper Biehn in Trueshot Lodge. ,"The eagle appears to have a message for you: To: <name>I hope this message finds you well. Word of Ohn'ahra's omen has traveled fast. There are many who wish to pledge their loyalty to the Unseen Path's new leader. Return to me at Trueshot Lodge, and we can discuss this further. - Altar Keeper Biehn"
2449,Meeting in Moonclaw Vale,Find Lyana Stardust in Val'sharah. ,"Lyana Stardust still lingers in a vale that has been overrun by demons. Despite its current start of upheaval, she refuses to abandon her home. The strength and stubbornness she exhibits in the face of an enemy are also traits that shine through in her enchantments. We want our weapons to be as strong and stubborn as she is. Meet her in Moonclaw Vale, and see if she can work her magic with the weapons that Kyriel has crafted for us. "
2450,Big Gamy Ribs,Have you brought us supplies? A level 10 Quest. ,"Thank you, <name>. This meat will help strengthen our troops. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(42930))"
2451,Delicate Enchantments,Protect Lyana Stardust while she enchants the azure weaponry. ,"As I'm sure you've noticed, demons have taken over the vale. Their arrival has forced many of my fellow druids to flee their homes, but I refuse to go down without a fight. Despite all this, I'm happy to provide enchantments for your weapons, but you should know that it is a delicate process that takes time and concentration, something I have little of lately. If you're willing to shelter me from attackers, I will certainly do my best to enchant your weapons. "
2452,Ready to Strike,Meet Nighthuntress Syrenne on the Broken Shore. ,"I followed one of the trappers, who unknowingly led me to the Broken Shore. 

Lexera was there, surrounded by an army of demons and loyal nightborne.

I wasn't able to get close, but from what I could tell, she and her army of trappers are taming the fel-corrupted beasts.

It is an abomination of nature, and she must be stopped!

Meet me on the Broken Shore and be ready to strike. I will gather additional manaroot. I have a feeling we'll need it. "
2453,Champion: Addie Fizzlebog,"I don't think Hemet himself could have taught me better, but I have to believe there's more to hunting than taking down big game. ","I don't think Hemet himself could have taught me better, but I have to believe there's more to hunting than taking down big game. Sticking with you, I think I'll be able to learn exactly what it means to be a true <class>. Here's to you, and the many grand adventures that await us! "
2454,Awakening the Senses,Help Baron awaken his senses by digging up Ancient Bones within the area. ,"I'm afraid old Baron here is past his prime. His nose can't catch a scent the way it used to. Others told me to put him down, but I can't bear the thought of losing my loyal friend. Baron was always at his best when working, though. Maybe if you let him wander through these fields and dig up some old bones, it'll be enough to awaken his senses. "
2455,The Missing Vessel,"Interact with the Scouting Map and complete ""The Missing Vessel"" missions to collect Shattered Vessel Fragments. ","So long as Hakkar roams free, no mage will be safe. Millificent Manastorm created a vessel that siphons the essence of a mage, binding their magic to the object. It was created to be a weapon, but we can use it as bait. If I channel my essence into the vessel, it will become an object of pure magic. Upon capture, Millificent shattered the vessel, allowing it to fall into the hands of our enemies. Find the pieces and return them to me. Together we can set a trap Hakkar won't be able to resist! "
2456,Knowing Our Enemy,Speak to Kira Iresoul in Azsuna. ,"If we hope to gain the upper hand against Hakkar, we need to find out more about these hounds that he's breeding and pinpoint their weaknesses. I know of a warlock that studies demons extensively. Maybe she has seen some of these hounds, and knows how to defeat them. "
2457,Same Day Delivery,Return to Emmarel Shadewarden at Trueshot Lodge. ,"I've enchanted these weapons to counter the natural resistances that felhounds have to magic. In addition to that, the metal should splinter their scales on impact, allowing your allies to do increased damage to the demons. While I don't expect the enchantment to decay over time, you should do your best to deliver these weapons to those who will use them immediately. The longer they remain here, the more demons their power will attract. "
2458,Secured Surroundings,Meet Nighthuntress Syrenne at Deliverance Point. ,"With Lexera defeated, her band of trappers will quickly disband. Those that refuse will meet my blade.

These shores will be free of those who wish to corrupt Azeroth's wildlife.

Our work here is done for now. Let us meet at Deliverance Point. There is more I wish to discuss in secured surroundings. "
2459,Assassin Entrapment,Set a trap at Carlisle Cottage to catch and kill Captain Tevaris. ,"Black Rook invaders are still targeting our farms and homes, even though there's not much left to pillage.

We had hoped that once they cleared us out that the attacks would stop, but it seems those mindless ghouls will follow any orders given by their commander.

We'd take him out ourselves, but he's a sneaky fella. The only way we're going to catch him, is if someone lays a trap. I can provide the supplies if you're willing to help. "
2460,The Nature of the Beast,Return to Emmarel Shadewarden at Trueshot Lodge. ,"By nature, this demon is immune to magic, but it has also been bred to be resistant to physical attacks. It's covered in scales unlike anything I've ever seen; layered and thick. I doubt that most metals will be able to pierce the demon's armor-like hide. Unless your entire army has weapons like yours, I suggest fighting those beasts with something that will exploit their weakness. "
2461,Champion: Huntsman Blake,You brought a tear to this old man's eye by bringing Baron back to life. ,"You brought a tear to this old man's eye by bringing Baron back to life. I never thought I'd miss his ear-piercing howls, but I did. It's a wonderful thing to see him working again. We're happy to help wherever we're needed. "
2462,Salvation,Use the Manaroot Salve on fel-infected animals. ,"The valley is swarming with fel-corrupted creatures who are beyond saving, yet there still may be some that could use our help.

Take this manaroot salve and apply it to any animals you see. If the fel magic hasn't taken hold, the salve might be able to mend their wounds. "
2463,Recruiting Rexxar,Find Rexxar in Highmountain. ,"To do the most good, we need the best hunters at our side. Having you leading the order is a great start, but we'll need others who share your skill and expertise if we plan on making an impact. Rexxar has a reputation of being one of the greatest hunters of his time, yet he's never been eager to aid the Unseen Path. He has a camp just north of here, where he and Misha live off the land. Maybe you can convince him to join our ranks. "
2464,Champion: Loren Stormhoof,"I've been expecting you, &lt; name&gt; . ","I've been expecting you, <name>. Ohn'ahra's presence told me that change would be coming. The Highmountain tribes have long been allies of the Unseen Path. My ancestors welcomed Namuria and her hunters to our land, and together, they helped build the lodge you stand in today. I am honored to serve at your side. "
2465,Ready to Work,Return to Emmarel Shadewarden in Trueshot Lodge. ,"If Baron's ready to work, I am too. We'll make our way to the hunter's lodge as soon as I pack up camp and get this dog fed. I'm sure with all that digging, he'll have a hearty appetite. "
2466,Bite of the Beast,Find the beast responsible for the attacks and bring its head to the mages holding Cora captive. ,"I will not leave my post without Cora.

A group of mages have her caged up like a beast, threatening to put her down.

They claim she's responsible for the death of one of their own, but I refuse to believe that. Cora is a loyal and obedient companion; she would never attack without my command.

I tracked the demon that was truly responsible to this location, but it put up quite a fight before getting away. My injuries prevented me from giving chase, but I am sure that beast has left a bloody trail. "
2467,Investigate the Broken Shore,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Menace on the Broken Shore"". ",All of us know the price we paid the last time we set foot upon the Broken Shore. <Tinderfell turns her eyes to the ground. >I recommend dispatching a scouting team to investigate the Legion's strength. We need to know what we're facing in that accursed place. 
2468,Assisting the Archmage,Return to Emmarel Shadewarden at Trueshot Lodge. ,"Hakkar maintains an army of felhounds that feed off of magic. As long as he remains within Azeroth, no mage will be safe. He and his hounds are immune to most spells, so I must ask for assistance in killing them. You have proven yourself more than capable, but are you willing to help take down this demon? "
2469,The Nighthuntress Beckons,Ride D'Bynn and let him lead you to Nighthuntress Syrene's location. ,"< D'Bynn becomes alert at the sound of his master's voice. Using his muzzle, he nudges your hand with a sense of urgency, inviting you to hop on his back. >"
2470,Troops in the Field,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Troops in the Field. ",It's time to send our newly trained archers out into the field. Look at the Scouting Map and send your champions and troops on a routine scouting mission. 
2471,Homecoming,Return to Emmarel Shadewarden at Trueshot Lodge. ,Cora has calmed enough to make the journey back to Trueshot Lodge. You can let Emmarel know that we are on our way home. 
2472,Scouting Reports,"Interact with the Scouting Map and complete ""Scouting Reports"". ","In the recent past, our order has spent a lot of time watching and waiting. With you at the helm, we'll be able to focus on our original calling. Take a look around us, <name>. Azeroth needs us now more than ever. The same enemy that led to our formation is threatening us once again. You should send someone to gather reports from our scouts. From there, we'll be able to focus our efforts where they are needed most. "
2473,Unnatural Consequences,Kill Nighthuntress Lexera. ,"Lexera and her trappers have taken over the valley.

She is stronger than she looks, <name>, and she fights with the strength of a dreadlord. Do not go in unprepared. 

I can handle these demons. Go, find Lexera, and make her feel the consequences of her unnatural endeavors. "
2474,Rising Troubles,Kill Risen Hounds in and around Bradensbrook. ,"Our village is swarming with beasts risen from the dead! The abominations never rest! They attack night and day. We're doing our best to keep them at bay, but it's getting to be more than the townsfolk can handle. They're tired and losing their will to fight. Anything you can do to lessen the burden would be greatly appreciated. "
2475,Tech It Up A Notch,Speak to Survivalist Bahn in Trueshot Lodge. ,"We are very fortunate to have come across Survivalist Bahn. He spent his younger years living off the land in Pandaria, relying on the native flora and fauna to survive. His firsthand experience with building from limited resources could really help shape Trueshot Lodge into something great. Speak to him now and see what he can do for us. "
2476,Taking Control,Kill Torturer Relyn and use his Control Orb to free Nighthuntress Syrene. ,"I've been withering away in this cage, prisoner to a wretch called Reyln.

He leads a group of nightborne that are using fel magic to corrupt and control the native wildlife.

The Burning Legion's reach has already spread too far for my liking.

Kill him and recover his control orb, so I can be released from this arcane prison! "
2477,Recruiting The Troops,Speak to Recruiter Lenara and train a troop of archers. ,"Our champions acquired the talents of Recruiter Lenara, an extraordinary archer. She can hit the smallest of targets at extended ranges. Her arrows never miss. Speak to her now and train a squad of archers. "
2478,Felbound Beasts,Kill Nightborne Trappers and free Felbound beasts. ,"So Reyln is taking orders from Lexera? Why am I not surprised. She seemed far too comfortable with the demons who infested our city.

We cannot let her succeed in corrupting Suramar's wildlife. I swore to protect the city of Suramar from all enemies, even those within its walls.

If you can deal with her trappers, I will do my best to track Nighthuntress Lexera down. "
2479,A Strong Right Hand,"Even with the support of your fellow hunters, the crusade against the Legion will consume much of your time and attention. ","Even with the support of your fellow hunters, the crusade against the Legion will consume much of your time and attention. It is a war you cannot fight alone. I first served our order's founder, Namuria Gladesong, acting as her eyes and ears when she was needed elsewhere. It would be my honor to do the same for you, <name>. "
2480,An Urgent Warning,Speak to Tactician Tinderfell. ,"<The soldier is wan and wounded, obviously in tremendous pain. >

Been held prisoner. . . since the assault on. . . the Broken Shore. . .

<She shudders. >

The demons. . . th-they are gathering. . . preparing. . .

Had to escape. . . to warn you. They must. . . be stopped! "
2481,More Than Just A Food Vendor,Eradicate 15 demons and give your conjured food to 10 starving prisoners. ,"Your champions made a good dent in thinning out the enemy's numbers. They also discovered a number of starving prisoners who could use our help. Your Conjured Mana Pudding or Fritters will be useful in getting them up on their feet. 

You should also dispatch as many of the remaining legion invaders back to the twisting nether as you can! "
2482,Kalec's Plan,Meet Kalecgos on the ridge near the Arcway Vaults. ,Your champion was unable to penetrate very far inside the Arcway Vaults due to the heavy legion presence around it.  Hopefully you will have better luck following Archmage Vargoth inside. Kalecgos will be waiting for you on the ridge overlooking Felsoul Hold. 
2483,A Terrible Loss,Return to the Hall of the Guardian. ,"I would say I am surprised by this terrible turn of events, but nothing surprises me of late. It is dark times when even the most upstanding of us can fall. . . 

We had best inform Archmage Khadgar of Vargoth's betrayal. "
2484,Eye of Azshara: A Magical Affliction,Fill a vial with arcane water from the Wrath of Azshara. ,"Archmage Vargoth's betrayal is an unimaginable loss to our cause, <name>. We will have to deal with him, but first Meryl's condition has become dire. 

Unfortunately it is not an illness at all, but a magical attack of fel origin. It may be his old nemesis Kathra'natir is behind it. We need to buy him time.

The Eye of Azshara contains a vast store of arcane energy from Queen Azshara herself. If we could obtain a vial of water from the Wrath of Azshara's body, that will sustain him for a while. "
2485,Archmage Vargoth's Retreat,Investigate Archmage Vargoth's quarters. ,"Archmage Vargoth has been absent for a while. You may have a look around his living quarters here in the citadel tower, <name>. Kalec will escort you there.

I will hold out hope that our esteemed colleague is merely up to his usual eccentricities. "
2486,"When There's a Will, There's a Way",Ask your champions to find a way into the Oculus. ,"The Oculus appears to have fallen to the Burning Legion and is heavily shielded. We will need to figure out a way to get you inside. 

I suspect your champions can help us out quite a bit. "
2487,Following In His Footsteps,Ask your champions to investigate Archmage Vargoth's travels. ,"Archmage Vargoth seems to be mixed up in something dangerous, not that that's unusual for an archmage of his caliber and experience!

The Arcway Vaults may be where he's headed, but we should investigate all leads in order to get a better idea of what he's up to. "
2488,Ari's Package,Bring Ari's package to Archmage Khadgar. ,"Look! It was right here under our noses. ""Arcanists Guide to Rare Diseases. "" Sheepish thing. Most books just want to be dusted off and read from time to time. We will leave the phials of nightwell energy and it will go with you meekly enough.

Here. I have packaged the book up for you to bring to Khadgar. I wrapped it in moth's wings to keep it soothed and light-hearted. And there is a gift for you. Just a small thing, really. "
2489,The Might of the Tirisgarde,Complete 10 World Quests. ,"The Tirisgarde has received requests from across the Broken Isles for aid in fighting the Burning Legion.

2491,A Covert Operation,Meet Ravandwyr in Azsuna. ,"Your champion discovered some sort of powerful magic emanating from the secretive Empyrean Society enclave in Azsuna. 

Archmage Vargoth asked me to request Meryl's aid in investigating it, but as you can see, Meryl is clearly too ill to travel at the moment. Would you be willing to go in his place?

You will need to prove yourself in order to gain entrance. We should be able to find something sufficient in the Hatecoil Warcamp in Azsuna. "
2492,Building Our Troops,Speak to Archmage Omniara and recruit some of her Water Elementals. ,"Archmage Omniara is a very powerful arcanist and her skills will be quite an asset to our order.

Speak to her now, and recruit her elementals. "
2493,Impending Dooooooom! ,Investigate the Nightborne Vault. ,"Millhouse attracts trouble, so he's sure to find Archmage Vargoth if he's still here.

Let's meet up at the rotunda on the hill. "
2495,"Rise, Champions",Recruit Archmage Kalec and Archmage Modera. ,"The Tirisgarde has been defunct for ages. To defeat the Burning Legion, we must first recruit the greatest champions of our class to fight by our side.

2496,Archmage Omniara,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Omniara Needs Help"". ","Beside me is the Scouting Map. From it, you can direct our allies to carry out vital assignments across the Broken Isles.

2497,The Enemy of My Enemy. . . ,Find Millhouse Manastorm. ,"Millhouse Manastorm has been quite vociferous about his intention to acquire the Nightborne Soulstone. If you find him, you may as well make use of him. 

However, he is unpredictable at best and you should always watch your back around him, <name>. Use my crystal to contact me once you have located him. "
2498,Prepare To Be Assimilated,Obtain the Pearl of Arcane Wisdom and 5 Nar'thalas Scrolls and meet up with Ravandwyr north of the Empyrean Enclave. ,"The Empyrean Society is a dangerous cult. They claim to study all magic regardless of its source, but in reality they focus mostly on the forbidden. They will welcome you to their enclave if you bring them a magical artifact.

The Hatecoil naga have found the perfect gifts - a Pearl of Arcane Wisdom and scrolls from the depths beneath the Nar'thalas Academy. You will have to convince them to part with a few.

I will meet you on the road just north of the Empyrean Enclave. "
2499,Burning Within,Speak with Khadgar about the Tri-Disc of Fire. ,"The first piece he spoke of was that of fire. He imbued it while investigating the entrance to the Molten Core. However, the power surging through it was too great to control, so he asked Khadgar to take it to Karazhan and see if there were any books on the subject of controlling fire. Perhaps you should speak with Khadgar and find out what became of the disc. "
2500,Ancient Magic,"Interact with your Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Ancient Magic. ","Since the Broken Isles is the epicenter of ancient night elven learning, there must be countless magical artifacts secreted away in forgotten vaults and reliquaries.

2501,A Conjuror's Duty,Use the Scouting Map to choose your first zone. ,"I don't know about you but I'm ready to get this show on the road. This place is nice and all, but it's a bit stuffy.

2503,Not A Toothless Dragon,Ride with Kalecgos to the Arcway Vaults. ,"The Arcway Vaults have been buried and untouched for thousands of years. We have the legion to thank for it being accessible once again, though I would give much for it to remain hidden.

I think we are not far behind Archmage Vargoth's heels and he may yet be inside the vaults. We should make haste if we hope to intercept him. "
2504,Troops in the Field,"Complete the mission, ""Troops in the Field. ","Our troops are ready! It's time to test them out in the field. We've received word of survivors near the Broken Shore, but the area is still crawling with Legion. Send our troops quickly to help with the rescue! "

2507,Empyrean Society Report,Return to the Hall of the Guardian. ,"I find it hard to believe that Archmage Vargoth would be involved with such a malevolent group! There must be a good explanation for why he's been here. . . 

Regardless, we had best return to the Hall of the Guardian and inform Meryl about what we've uncovered here. "
2508,Champion: Meryl Felstorm,"I have been fighting the Burning Legion for an eternity, &lt; name&gt; . ","I have been fighting the Burning Legion for an eternity, <name>. I would be honored to impart my wisdom to you as you lead the fight against them once again. I believe I have picked up a few tricks they will not expect! "
2509,The Nightborne Apprentice,Meet Arcanist Ryanna in the Crimson Thicket. ,"I would be happy to introduce you to my new apprentice if you do not mind traveling a bit. She is currently in the field keeping an eye on an enclave of Felborne resistance fighters who have sworn loyalty to the Legion. 

As the first nightborne to join the Tirisgarde, I am sure she is eager to prove her skills! "
2510,Technical Wizardry,Talk to Archmage Melis. ,"Now that you have your first two champions, there is an abundance of work they can do to help us. Archmage Melis has been hard at work getting our command room up and running. Head downstairs and ask her to show you what needs to be done. "
2511,Keymaster Orlis,Kill Keymaster Orlis and search his body. ,"The Felborne insurgents appear to be guarding a teleporter pad within the glade ahead. I wonder where it leads?

It is probably safe to assume that we'll need to kill Keymaster Orlis in order to gain access. "
2512,Champion: The Great Akazamzarak,"You know, you're a useful fella to have around, &lt; name&gt; . ","You know, you're a useful <fella/dame> to have around, <name>. 

Tell ya what, I think I'll accompany you on your adventures. Seems to be good gold in it, and I think it'll be a good way to scout out some new business opportunities around the Broken Isles.

What do you say? "
2513,Champion: Arcane Destroyer,"&lt; The Arcane Destroyer makes a high pitched, quizzical chirp and looks at you expectantly. ","<The Arcane Destroyer makes a high pitched, quizzical chirp and looks at you expectantly. >"
2514,Final Exit,Use the Rune of Opening to unlock the Empyrean Society building door. ,"We've certainly reduced the Empyrean Society's numbers. I don't think they'll be luring any more members to their cause for a while. 

There's only one place we haven't investigated, and I suspect that rune we found is attuned to the door. Let's see what's inside the building. "
2515,An Unexpected Visitor,Meet up with Ravandwyr. ,"Archmage Vargoth's long-time apprentice, Ravandwyr, has arrived here in the Hall of the Guardian with an urgent message from his mentor.

He will be waiting for you upstairs. You had best find him quickly, <name>! "
2516,"Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe",Return to Ari in the Hall of the Guardian. ,"The shield generator you found is much more than it appears. I do not think my elders would approve of such advanced technology being shared with outlanders. . .

And yet. . . We owe you our lives and our freedom. 

You may use it, with my blessing. Just. . . please be discreet about its existence, Archmage <name>. "
2517,Tech It Up A Notch,Speak to Chronicler Elrianne. ,"Thanks to you, the Hall of the Guardian is gradually re-assembling. However, there is much more work to do. As our leader, you can determine the trajectory of our order's future. Speak to Chronicler Elrianne. She will show you the ropes. "
2518,Backup Plan,Speak with Archmage Kalec. ,"Dalaran may appear to be just a floating city, but it is actually our most powerful magical weapon. It will take time to repair the arcane defenses - time the Legion will use to their great advantage.

It is imperative to come up with an interim plan, and quickly! Archmage Kalec is very knowledgeable about this sort of thing. Perhaps you should consult with him? "
2519,Return of the Archmage,Speak to Meryl in the Hall of the Guardian. ,"With Dalaran protected once again, we can all breathe a little easier. 

It is time for us to return to the Hall of the Guardian. I'm sure Meryl is anxiously awaiting word of our success. "
2520,Finders Keepers,Sweep up 8 piles of Arcane Dust in the Hall of the Guardian. ,"Would you look at this place? It's a mess! Everywhere you look there's just pile after pile of arcane dust! <Akazamzarak smiles broadly. >These poor saps don't realize what that stuff's worth! I tell ya what, if you help me summon up some brooms to collect this powdered gold, I'll split the profits with you 80/20. "
2521,Champion: Aethas Sunreaver,"Archmage, the events of the past have long weighed heavily upon me. ","Archmage, the events of the past have long weighed heavily upon me. While I do not regret my actions, I do regret what happened. If I could go back and change things. . . I hope in time the Kirin Tor - indeed, all of Azeroth - will better understand my loyalties. Thanks to you, crisis has been averted. Please accept my enduring gratitude. "
2522,Recruiting Apprentices,Speak to Grand Conjuror Mimic. ,Grand Conjuror Mimic has arrived to aid us in bolstering our numbers. She seeks out the most promising apprentices and trains them very quickly. Her former students are some of the most powerful conjurors in the land! Speak to her and recruit some of her apprentices to add to our roster. 
2523,Arming Dalaran,Travel to the Dalaran Spire via Aethas' portal. ,"Kathra'natir is powerless to stop us from harnessing his energy within the Nightborne Soulstone. We have been lucky thus far - our allies have kept news of the sabotage from spreading. 

We should repair Dalaran's weapons array immediately while luck is still on our side.

Oh - the weapon platform is a bit inaccessible. I trust you are not afflicted by a fear of heights? I will open a portal. "
2524,Shield Amplification,Use the Nightborne Soulstone on defeated Felborne within the Weeping Terrace. ,"It will not hurt to reinforce the Nightborne Soulstone 's shield just a bit more, and to do that we must infuse it with energy. 

Ryanna has assured me that fel essence will work beautifully for our needs. Yes - this method IS rather distasteful. However as the sin'dorei well know, desperate times call for desperate measures.

It is as simple as this: we have an urgent need for magical energy, and our enemies possess it in abundance. 

Do what must be done. "
2525,Chilled to the Core,Speak with Archmage Cedric near the Dalaran Crater about the Tri-Disc of Frost. ,"The next piece Antonidas made was imbued with frost magic. He wrote about a ritual to channel frost energy into the disc with his fellow Archmage, Cedric, but their combined strengths forced too much energy into the disc. If I recall, Cedric is helping oversee the reconstruction of Dalaran near the crater where Dalaran once resided. Hopefully he knows where to find the disc. "
2526,Champion: Archmage Vargoth,"You have saved my reputation, not to mention my life! Without your persistence, I would still be hanging above the Nexus yet, &lt; name&gt; . ","You have saved my reputation, not to mention my life! Without your persistence, I would still be hanging above the Nexus yet, <name>. I hope you will accept my everlasting gratitude. "
2527,The Vault of the Tirisgarde,Find 5 Ancient Artifacts within the Hall of the Guardian. ,"Dalaran's weapons are arcane in origin, but that doesn't mean we can't try something different. 

Our order's vaults contain a vast store of magical devices. . . Why don't you take a look around and see if there's anything we can use? "
2528,Champion: Archmage Modera,"It is good to see the Tirisgarde rise again, &lt; name&gt; . ","It is good to see the Tirisgarde rise again, <name>. While not everyone on the Council of Six agrees with me, I believe it is imperative for us to work together and defeat the Burning Legion once and for all! "
2529,Some Knowledge Shouldn't Be Shared,Collect 5 Empyrean Fel Tomes. ,I noticed that quite a few of the Empyrean Society's books are inscribed with fel magic. That's blasphemous. We must confiscate as many as we can. 
2530,Champion: Esara Verrinde,You and I have proven to be quite successful together. ,"You and I have proven to be quite successful together. I'd be happy to lend you my swords and spells against the Burning Legion anytime, <name>. "
2531,Retaliation,Kill 7 Felborne Insurgents. ,"Of course I will help you! Although to be honest, I am not certain where a new arcane shield generator can be found these days. So many of our craftspeople have been executed. . . I will think on it.

Would you mind helping me as well? I have been observing a nearby group of Felborne for some time. Their activities have become increasingly brazen of late.

I think it's time to teach them how it feels to be violently suppressed. "
2532,Into the Hornet's Nest,Use the teleporter pad. ,I hope you are up for an adventure. Shall we see where that teleporter goes? 
2533,An Adventurer's Aid,Use the Scouting Map to choose your first zone. ,"We've discovered that there are many issues around the land which we float above, the Broken Isles.

We'll do what we can from here. I want you to look at the nearby map to see who you can aid first. "
2534,The Council is in Session,Speak to the Council of Six in Dalaran. ,"Archmage Vargoth's involvement with the Empyrean Society is troubling. However, as he has proven his loyalty to the Kirin Tor many times, we must give him the benefit of the doubt for now. 

Still, I am obligated to share our concerns with the rest of the Council. You had best travel to Dalaran and meet with them in the Violet Citadel. I will remain here to care for our old friend. "
2535,Close to Home,Speak to Archmage Celindra about the Tri-Disc of the Arcane here in Dalaran. ,"The third piece of the disc was infused with Antonidas' own arcane magic. He did this at the height of his power, but like the other two discs, was unable to finish his work on it. He wrote that he gave the piece to Archmage Celindra. . . Isn't she the portal trainer here in Dalaran? She must know where the piece is! Quickly, go speak with her. "
2536,Orange is the New Purple,Accept a gift from the magi of Tirisgarde. ,"<name>, your intelligence and leadership inspires awe in all of us!

Tirisgarde is prepared to furnish you with a full set of armor to aid in the fight against the Burning Legion. Continue expanding your influence across the Broken Isles, and we may yet achieve victory. "
2537,The Next Level Has Arrived,Kill 10 Empyrean Society members. ,"The Empyrean Society is certainly much more dangerous than they appear. It's unimaginable that any mage would study fel magic -- that's for warlocks and the Legion!

Since our friend, Ravandwyr, appears to be delayed, it looks like we'll have to deal with this ourselves. We should remove this sect so they can't corrupt anyone else. "
2538,Redundancy,Meet Aethas on the Broken Shore. ,"A construct progenitor? What a creative solution to our problem!

We probably could channel Kathra'natir's power without releasing him now, but I want to add another layer of protection before we try, just in case. I will not have anyone accusing me of subterfuge!

Meet me on the Broken Shore when you are ready. "
2539,A Creative Solution,Talk to Ari. ,"The Nightborne Soulstone may be our best hope if we can come up with a way to safely use it without Kathra'natir escaping. If he were to get loose in Dalaran. . .

We should consult with our friend, Ari. She will know what modifications need to be done. "
2540,Champion: Archmage Kalec,"The blue dragonflight has always represented magic on Azeroth, and it is fitting that we work together against the Burning Legion now more than ever.

I would be honored to fight for you as your champion in these dark times. "
2541,Nyell's Workshop,Kill Master Artificer Nyell. ,"From what I've overheard, this is Master Artificer Nyell 's workshop. His skills in construct creation are unparalleled! 

What a shame that he swore fealty to the Legion. I hate to destroy such a renowned craftsman, but we have no choice.

If you are lucky, he might even have a spare shield generator sitting around. "
2542,Champion: Ravandwyr,I have been Archmage Vargoth's apprentice for far too long. ,"I have been Archmage Vargoth's apprentice for far too long. Perhaps it is time for me to serve a new master. I would be honored if you would accept me as your champion, <name>. "
2543,Nothing Up My Sleeve,Use Akazamzarak's Hat to perform a magic trick. ,"Now, you may think that a sack of gold would be a good reward for your troubles, but I've got something better in mind for you.

I'm gonna teach you my best trick!

I know, I know, I'm a very generous goblin.   Let me show you how it's done! "
2544,Lady Remor'za,Kill Lady Remor'za. ,"Our allies reported a coven of extremely powerful Felborne abjurers occupying the Weeping Terrace. 

Their leader, Lady Remor'za, and her followers are specialists in ancient nightborne magic and can become nearly invincible to attacks. 

However, as mages, we should be able to defeat them using Spellsteal. Let us show them the power of the Tirisgarde! "
2545,Secrets of the Shal'dorei,Gather 8 Ancient Shal'dorei Scrolls. ,"This workshop includes an extensive library of rare scrolls written by my people. We all benefit by sharing information, do you not agree? 

Perhaps if we bring back such a treasure trove the Tirisgarde will be more welcoming towards me and my kind. . .

Please gather whatever you can. "
2546,Servant to No One,Test Akazamzarak's Servants on 5 people in Dalaran. ,"I like workin' with ya, <name>. How's about we keep this gold train a-rollin'? Archmage Khadgar spends an inordinate amount of time sending his servants off to do who knows what. What if an enterprising duo such as ourselves found a cheaper alternative? <Akazamzarak hands you a small crystal. >This bad boy will form a servant right out of thin air - and a few pounds of the dust you swept up. Why not take it into town and try her out? See for yourself! "
2551,A Brewing Situation,"Direct the Stormstout Brewers to distribute Celebration Brew to the temple balcony, in front of the Laughing Crane, and near the troop training grounds. ","Greetings, Grandmaster. I'm an expert at producing tricky brews, and Almai and I have been working with Stormstout Brewery to craft Storm Brew for the order.

2555,Impending Danger,"Complete the mission, ""Impending Danger. ","Our scouts have sighted a fel command ship looming on the horizon, Grandmaster. It appears to be headed on a collision course with the Wandering Isle. We should prepare our troops for the worst case situation - an all out attack. In the meantime, let us send our champions ahead to try and divert the Legion ship's attention. "
2556,Tracking the Tideskorn,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the ""Tracking the Tideskorn"" missions. ","We have sent scouts to search for our kidnapped allies, and our efforts may have finally paid off.

2560,The Mead Master,Speak to Aegira in Stormheim. ,"The Storm Brew is created by a legendary vrykul brewmaster named Melba. Here is the location of her meadery along the northern Stormheim coast.

2561,Scrolls of Knowledge,"Complete the mission, ""Scrolls of Knowledge. ","Our troops are ready! It's time to test them out in the field, and I have the perfect assignment.

Once a year, on the first day of solstice, the sun hits the white-capped summit of the highest peak in Highmountain. The melting snow runs through a ravine and collects in a crystalline pool. Some say these waters grant eternal youth. Silly stories if you ask me, but we will need this rare, purified water for our brew. I suggest sending our champions to collect us a sample, for your skills will be needed elsewhere. "
2564,"Storm, Earth, and Fire","Destroy 5 Fel Spikes, put out 5 Fel Fires, and destroy 5 Tainted Ale barrels. ","Tian Monastery is in bad shape. Felspreader imps are torching the grounds. Fel spikes radiate foul energy, corrupting the nearby earth. And fel magic has seeped into the monastery's ale barrels, tainting the brew.

Just get it done. "
2565,Meditations on Fate,Place a work order for a Seal of Broken Fate. ,"We are able to procure a valuable item to help you in our war against the Legion. This Seal can be used at the most opportune moments to grant another chance at destiny.

2567,Slowing the Spread,Destroy 3 Fel Spreaders. ,"Reinforcements. Just what we needed! Grandmaster, the monastery is under attack.

2569,The Trail of Ban-Lu,Follow the trail of Ban-Lu. ,"It seems a lifetime ago that Grandmaster Hight was walking these grounds. 

While Ban-Lu has served every previous Grandmaster, he and Hight were the greatest of friends.

For many years they traveled the land, connecting with its people and maintaining our fragile peace.

2572,The Tale of Ban-Lu,Listen to Master Bu's story. ,"Oh, hello, you must be the new Grandmaster.

< Master Bu squints at you and sniffs. >

You young ones have no patience these days, always running off to fight your great battles.

It is there that we must begin our search for him. "
2584,No Monk Left Behind,Free 6 Tortured Prisoners. ,"Most of the prisoners are being held in the main camp at the Gates of Valor.

She has requested the Conclave's assistance. Seek her out, High Priest, and do whatever you can to stop this sickness from spreading. "
2684,Allies of the Light,Looking for Paladin quest? See Allies of the Light. ,"Both Arator and Delas are still somewhere on this forsaken rock, as well as many of our other allies. We cannot leave them, <name>. "
2685,Eye of Azshara: Looking Through the Lens,Recover the Lens of the Tide from Lady Hatecoil within the Eye of Azshara dungeon. ,"We have what we need to create Velen's elixir, but in order for others to be able to witness his vision, we'll need to find something that can be used to project images from the mind. A lens from the nearby naga should work well, but I don't think they're going to be too eager to give it up. "
2686,Crossing Legion Lines,Use the demon portal at Felblaze Ingress to enter Niskara and find Aponi Brightmane. ,"I've received word from the Highlord that a group of paladins and priests were captured after a battle broke out at Felblaze Ingress. Your priestess, Delas Moonfang, was among those captured. They've been taken through the demon portal and into the Legion stronghold of Niskara. We will need the assistance of the Conclave if we have any hope of recovering them. "
2687,Murloc Mind Control,Rescue Yalia Sagewhisper from the murlocs within El'dranil Shallows. ,"Yalia and I were deliverin' antidotes to da front lines a Faronaar when we were attacked by a herd a murlocs. We dropped our supplies and made a run for it, but Yalia never made it out a da camp. Obviously I didn't fair much better, ma bones still ache from bein' turned to stone. It's possible Yalia's still alive and bein' held captive. Please, ya have to find her! "
2688,Halls of Valor: The Light Within,Recover a Spark of Light from Hyrja within the Halls of Valor dungeon. ,"We cannot ignore the Prophet's vision, <name>. To do so would mean that everything we know and hold dear will be lost to the Legion. We must focus on what we know, and that is that the Light must walk among us. Within the Halls of Valor you will find an ascending val'kyr by the name of Hyrja. Recover a spark of her Light and release it within our temple. "
2689,Shambling Specimens,Use Shackle Undead on Shambling Corpses in order to collect specimens with the Corpse Collector. ,"This fel contagion appears to have three stages. The first is marked by a persistent, phlegmy cough. The second shows the skin turning a sickly shade of green. The third involves a complete transformation where the victim turns into a mindless corpse. It is within this stage that I believe the most information about the sickness can be gathered. I have a contraption that can safely store the specimens, but they will need to be shackled before they can be collected. "
2690,Onslaught Envoy,Find a new ally among old enemies in New Hearthglen. ,"A few defectors have been discovered among the Scarlet Onslaught in Northrend. I know it's difficult to think that any within their ranks could be useful to our cause, but we must make an attempt. The prophecy says an old enemy will become an ally, so it's worth it to investigate and see if these defectors can be brought to the Light. "
2691,The Best and Brightest,Find Zabra Hexx in Azsuna. ,"If we wish to see the truth in Gilner's ramblings, I will need to induce a vision. It is not the sort of thing that is typically forced, but we have within our ranks the best and brightest alchemists who can craft an extract that will grant me the sight I need. Seek them out in Azsuna where they are currently aiding those on the front lines. "
2692,Infiltrating Our Enemies,"Interact with the Command Map and complete the mission, ""Infiltrating Our Enemies"". ","With the Light at our side, we should focus our efforts on figuring out who among our enemies could be a potential ally.

Any of your champions should be capable of infiltrating enemy ranks, giving us a better understanding of how to approach this.

Even so, it is a delicate task. Proceed with caution. "
2693,Crafting a Cure,Infuse the Untested Cure with magic before administering it to Roland Abernathy. ,"I used what you gathered for me to craft what I hope will be a reliable cure. The only thing that's missing is some powerful magic, which I hope you'll be able to provide. The concoction is there on my alchemy table. Please hurry, <name>. Roland grows weaker by the minute. "
2694,Scarlet Redemption,Help Mariella the Heretic redeem herself by killing members of the Scarlet Onslaught in New Hearthglen. ,"The Light shines upon me, <name>! For the first time in my life, I feel it!

Please, let me prove to you that I am worthy of a second chance. Let me slay those I used to be loyal to! "
2695,Mischievous Sprites,Use Dispel Magic on Soothoof Hillstriders to reveal Mischievous Sprites and collect their Shimmering Dust. ,"It's a little-known secret that the dust sprites use for their various tricks has restorative properties. Some within the alchemy community balk at this claim, but they only refute it because they've never been able to get their hands on the rare ingredient. Sprites often shroud themselves in illusions to avoid detection. The nearby goats have a curious shimmer about them that suggests they may be sprites in disguise. Dispel whatever magic surrounds them to reveal their true form. "
2696,Unexpected Guests,Return to Alonsus Faol in Netherlight Temple. ,"You helped me escape my fate by freeing me from the gallows, but allowing me to fight the Scarlet Onslaught by your side has truly freed my heart and mind from the guilt I have felt for so long.

I want to be a part of something greater than myself, a noble cause that won't distort the meaning of the Light. 

Let me travel to your temple and beg forgiveness of the Prophet. I may not be a welcome guest, but it's a journey I must make to complete my redemption. "
2697,Whispers in the Void,Speak to Gilner Greymoss in the Sanctuary of the Void. ,"Our priests are resting and recuperating, but one not as well as the others. Gilner Greymoss lingers within the Sanctuary of the Void, laughing to himself. He refuses to leave, but his presence is making the other priests uneasy. Perhaps you should speak to him and see what is wrong? "
2698,Problem Salver,Use the salve on diseased demon hunters at Faronaar Front in Azsuna. ,"Forcing a vision isn't easy by any means. Finding the ingredients for the elixir alone will take a considerable amount of time, time we don't have. Too many are suffering on the front lines as we speak, in need of the salve we were meant to deliver. I suppose if we all work together, we can make this work. Zabra and I will find the items needed for Velen's elixir, if you take the salve to Faronaar and cure the demon hunters. Does that sound fair? "
2699,To the Broken Shore,Head to the Broken Shore. ,We've received word from those fighting on the Broken Shore. It seems the source of the contagion can be pinpointed to a specific island off the western coast. Many of our allies have already been infected. We must work quickly to ensure that the contagion doesn't spread. 
2700,Awakening the Light,Collect Pure Holy Light by completing Class Hall missions. ,"This spark will only know its full potential once it's been filled with pure Light, gleaned from the holiest places in our world. Nurture this spark, and it may grow to walk among you. "
2701,Forgotten Shadows,Head to Duskwood and meet with a member of the Cult of Forgotten Shadows. ,"The Light walks among us, as does one of our enemies. You have done well to bring the prophecy to life, but it is not yet complete.

The shadows must rise, and to do so, the Cult of Forgotten Shadows must be restored. 

You will find the few remaining followers at the cemetery in Duskwood. They linger there near the grave of their fallen leader. "

2703,Aiding the Conclave,Return to Alonsus Faol within Netherlight Temple. ,"The priests of the Conclave are formidable allies. With our combined strength, we may just have a chance to slay the dreadlord, forever.

2705,Sampling the Source,Collect Contaminated Specimens from pools of Gaseous Fel around the western coast of Highmountain. ,"My companion has fallen terribly ill, as you can see. 

He must have caught whatever these taurens had. Their entire camp has been wiped out!

It appears to be fel in origin, and impervious to all known treatments. 

I've been working tirelessly to find a cure, but I don't think Roland here has much time left. 

I could use an extra hand. Some samples from the source should speed things up. 

Just be sure to avoid direct contact with the contagion. Levitate should be helpful. "
2706,Actions on Azeroth,Use the Command Map to select your order's first operational area. ,"Let me show you the Command Map. Thanks to some draenei construction and naaru magic we now have a window into the Broken Isles! You can devise strategy, send your agents on missions, and choose our first area to operate in. Take a look and let me know where we are going! "
2707,"Rise, Champions",Recruit Calia Menethil and High Priestess Ishanah. ,"As leader of our order, other priests will look to you for guidance. Many will be willing to pledge themselves to you, doing whatever is necessary to bring down the Burning Legion. After your display of power during the cleansing ritual, there will be many who are eager to serve at your side. Seek out those priests, and let them ease the burden of leadership. "
2708,Champion: Aelthalyste,"All these priests? They report to you? It's astonishing, really. ","All these priests? They report to you? It's astonishing, really. I have only one Roland, and it seems you have hundreds! I think we will get along well, <name>. Very well, indeed. Allow me to stay, and in return, I will offer you my services. "
2709,The Mind of the Enemy,"Find the Legion Intelligence, Star Map, and Image of Velen, then slay Brood Queen Aramis. ","The demon jailors spoke of an upcoming invasion. Their army is gathering for something big, and it worries me greatly. Let us find whatever information we can about their plans. "
2710,Velen's Vision,Use the Lens of the Tides to witness Prophet Velen's vision. ,"I have everything I need to bring forth a vision, but the question remains: are you ready to witness it? Even the smallest glimpse into the future can weigh heavy on your soul. Once I ingest the elixir, the vision will come quickly. Gazing into the Lens of the Tides will allow you to see what I see. Let me know when you are ready to begin. "
2711,Champion: Zabra Hexx,"I have a good feelin' about ya, &lt; name&gt; . ","I have a good feelin' about ya, <name>. Dis terrible day really started to turn around when ya showed up. Some might call it luck, but I think it's fate. We were meant to cross paths. Dis could be da beginnin' a somethin' great. "
2712,Rising Shadows,Return to Alonsus Faol at Netherlight Temple. ,"News of my return will spread fast among those who share my beliefs. Soon Azeroth will see the rise of Shadows, but I imagine this is not news to you.

Whatever your plan may be, I hope it continues to see the Cult of Forgotten Shadows as allies. "
2713,Into the Void,Read Natalie's Journal at the catacomb's shadow altar to enter the void and recover her spirit. ,"This is without a doubt Natalie's writing. The entry was scrawled in haste, but the message is clear: The spell within this journal will lead us to Natalie's spirit, but it needs to be incanted at a shadow altar within the catacombs. Odessa and I have a duty to watch over Natalie's body, but with your considerable power, you should be able to perform the spell with ease. "
2714,Fortifying the Temple,Complete 10 World Quests. ,"We've all worked so hard turning this temple into something all priests can be proud of, it would be a shame to see it fall to the Burning Legion. We must strengthen our defenses in preparation for the attack. With the right resources, we can make the temple a nearly impenetrable fortress. "
2715,Champion: Yalia Sagewhisper,"Your willingness to help is admirable, and it gives me insight into what kind of leader you will be. ","Your willingness to help is admirable, and it gives me insight into what kind of leader you will be. I know you mean to gather priests from all factions and lead them in a battle against the Burning Legion. It's an extraordinary task, but one that you will not have to embark on alone. "
2716,Champion: Mariella Ward,"I owe you my life, and so much more. ","I owe you my life, and so much more. You saw something in me worth saving, and allowed me to eventually believe that as well. Let me live my life with purpose, <name>. Let me fight by your side. "
2717,Secrets of the Void,Recover Natalie's Journal from Twilight Lord Urgrok. ,"Our leader was murdered for her beliefs, or so most would believe.

Natalie Seline knew her fate, and took steps to protect herself from an inevitable death. 

The night her attackers came, Natalie sent her spirit to the Void, its location known only to Natalie herself.

She penned a spell to retrieve it in one of her many journals, but the tome has since fallen into the hands of those who wished her dead in the first place.

Without her journal, we will never be able to recover her spirit. "
2718,Champion: Natalie Seline,"You pulled my spirit from the Void, which is no easy feat. ","You pulled my spirit from the Void, which is no easy feat. I cannot deny the part of me that would stay there forever, embraced by the shadows. The Void is filled with many whispers, <name>. The kind that should have us all worried. We cannot afford to be separated by our beliefs. We must come together as priests of both Light and Shadow to face the Burning Legion together. "
2719,Proper Introductions,Return to Alonsus Faol within Netherlight Temple. ,"I'm glad I found you. 

I have a message from Alonsus Faol.

He says introductions are in order, and requests your presence within Netherlight Temple at your earliest convenience. "
2720,Sterile Surroundings,Return to Netherlight Temple. ,"With the threat of infection dismissed, your allies should be able to press their assault here on the Broken Shore and gain an advantage over the Burning Legion.

Let's leave this place and speak somewhere more. . . sterile. I hear your order occupies an impressive temple. "
2721,Tech It Up A Notch,Speak to Archon Torias in Netherlight Temple. ,"We are very fortunate to have come across Archon Torias.

His knowledge will be invaluable as we improve our defenders and fortify Netherlight Temple. "

I'd like to take credit for finding our leader, but I really think the truth of it is, you found us. Our time together has only just begun, <name>. "
2723,Recruiting the Troops,Speak to Grand Anchorite Gesslar and train a troop of acolytes. ,"Our recruiting efforts have paid off. Grand Anchorite Gesslar has pledged his service to our order.

"
2724,Countering the Contagion,Counter the contagion by killing Ozzuk the Corrupter and destroying his fel spreaders. ,"I have tracked the source of the contagion to these very shores. The Burning Legion are using fel spreaders to pump out infectious fel creep, causing anyone who comes into contact with it to become sick.

Take out Ozzuk the Corrupter and his fel spreaders so that the contagion can be contained. "
2725,Power Word: Armor,Accept a gift from the Conclave. ,"<name>, your wisdom and leadership inspires awe in all of us!

The Conclave is prepared to furnish you with a full set of armor to aid in the fight against the Burning Legion. Continue expanding your influence across the Broken Isles, and we may yet achieve victory. "
2726,Troops in the Field,"Use the Command Map and complete the mission, ""Troops in Training"". ",It's time to send our newly trained acolytes out into the field. Look at the Command Map and send your champions and troops on a routine scouting mission. 
2727,Administering Aid,Apply the Contagion Counteragent to sickly Legionfall Fighters. ,"Unfortunately, it would seem many of your allies have already taken to fighting on these fel corrupted shores. 

They will never be able to gain the upper hand in battle while so many are suffering from the contagion.

Roland and I will handle the injuries here. "

Speak to her now. "
2731,Safekeeping,Take the Contagion Counteragent to Alonsus Faol in Netherlight Temple. ,"It would seem that a delicate balance of holy and shadow magic is the key to curing this contagion. Obviously the remedy will need a bit of work to reduce undesired side effects, like dying. In the meantime, take the counteragent back to Netherlight Temple and keep it safe. I will work diligently on discovering the source of this contagion. "
2732,Runescale Koi,Have you brought us supplies? A level 45 Quest. ,"Good work, <name>. These supplies are crucial to crafting the elixirs we will need for the upcoming battle. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(43925))"

I do not want to talk about it just yet. Not until we have proof.

2740,The Raven's Eye,Listen to Valeera's tale of the Raven's Eye. ,"It is imperative that we decipher the SI: 7 letter. We must uncover the secrets that it holds before it is too late. But, our best code breakers have yet to make a dent in the cypher.

A big one.

Explosives placed in a few key locations should do nicely. Noggenfogger is playing nice and has donated some bombs to the cause. He might be trying to smooth over relations due to his earlier extortion.

I can have someone go ahead and mark the best locations. You want to do the honors? "

Anywhoodles, he more than suggested, in that way of his, that we send Garona, Vanessa, and our new merry gang of bandits off to have a little chat with The Wolf at Ravenholdt Manor.

Of the two aspiring Firelords, Lord Smolderon hates mortals less. If we help him defeat his rival and ascend to Firelord, he may unite with us in return.

It appears that her study of the Maelstrom Pillar has been most enlightening. If you have a moment, you should go and meet with her to discuss her progress. "
2828,The Skies Above,Speak with Celestos in The Vortex Pinnacle. ,"There has been no Windlord to lead the air elementals since the death of Al'Akir. The realm of Skywall has been thrown into turmoil. The throne of Al'Akir is Thunderaan's by right, but what remains of the prince's essence within Thunderfury is diminishing. If we do not move quickly, Thunderaan may be lost forever.

2829,The Return of Twilight,Speak with Muln Earthfury in Deepholm. ,"The Twilight's Hammer has reemerged and they are building an army to overthrow my kingdom. A ludicrous fantasy on their part, but one that I cannot take lightly. I cannot offer the mortal races my aid until the threat to Deepholm has been dealt with.

","While scouting on the Broken Shore, we have stumbled upon something quite unsettling. The Legion is attempting to harness the powers of Azeroth's elements. What is more, they are succeeding. We must stop them at all costs. I can open a portal for you to meet Therazane at the Garrison of the Fel. She will update you on the situation. "
2837,The Great Stonemother,Speak with Therazane in Deepholm. ,"In order to unite the four Elemental Lords of Azeroth, you will need to seek out Therazane and convince her to join the cause of Azeroth. However, the Stonemother currently has her hands full battling a Twilight's Hammer resurgence in Deepholm. If we lend Therazane our aid she may agree to unite with the Earthen Ring against the Burning Legion. Journey to Therazane 's Throne in the heart of Deepholm. Aid her in defeating the Twilight's Hammer and convince her to join the defense of Azeroth! "
2838,Unleashing the Elements,Release the Servants of Therazane from Twilight Depths. ,"According to The Master's journal, the Twilight's Hammer has discovered a method of harnessing the void to subjugate even the most powerful of elementals. The journal specifically mentioned the children of Therazane as test subjects. Whether The Master was speaking literally or figuratively in this regard, I do not know. Regardless, we need to free these elementals and stop these dark rituals from continuing. It appears that our journey here is going to take us deeper into the depths of darkness. . . "
2839,Nobundo Awaits,Speak with Nobundo in the Heart of Azeroth. ,"Nobundo and the other champions of the Earthen Ring have gathered down below. They are awaiting your arrival, Farseer. A great ritual is about to take place and they have requested your presence. Do not worry about your administrative duties for now, I'll take care of things here. Nobundo is waiting for you now. May the elements be with you, Farseer. "
2840,Troops in the Field,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Troops in the Field. ",It is time for us to test the strength of your newly summoned Lesser Elementals. Look at the Scouting Map and send your champions and troops on a routine scouting mission. 
2841,The Twilight Master,Defeat the Mistress of Twilight. ,"There is only one more thing that remains, Farseer <name>. We must confront the leader of the Twilight's Hammer and put an end to their sinister plot once and for all. Without their so-called master, the remaining cultists will be forced to retreat from Deepholm. Only when The Twilight's Hammer has been crushed and Deepholm has been saved, will we have the support of Therazane against the demons of the Burning Legion. "
2842,Return to Janai,Return to Elementalist Janai at the Heart of Azeroth. ,"< Ma'haat the Indomitable speaks to you with a low, rumbling voice. >Here. . . is the Egg of Gaiath. It is yours now. Go. . . in peace. "

I recommend that you speak with her at your soonest convenience, Farseer <name>. The Earthcallers are powerful shaman and will greatly bolster our ranks. "
2844,A Vision of Triumph,Accept a gift from the Earthen Ring. ,"<name>, your strength and leadership inspires awe in all of us!

The Earthen Ring is prepared to furnish you with a full set of armor to aid in the fight against the Burning Legion. Continue expanding your influence across the Broken Isles, and we may yet achieve victory. "
2845,Snakes and Stones,Find either the Doomstone or Arikara on Darkcloud Pinnacle. ,"When the demons attack, they captured two very powerful possessions of mine: my companion Arikara and the Doomstone. While death matters not to Arikara, the Legion surely has ulterior plans for him. And the Doomstone. . . such an artifact of power belongs in my hands, not theirs. We must split up to find them. For the world's sake, do be careful. I don't need you clumsily destroying everything. "
2846,Champion: Duke Hydraxis,Lord Neptulon has sent me to aid the Earthen Ring in the defense of Azeroth. ,"Lord Neptulon has sent me to aid the Earthen Ring in the defense of Azeroth. I have been commanded to serve the Farseer of the Earthen Ring with the same loyalty I give to the Lord of Tides. I will fulfill this duty until the Burning Legion is driven from this world and the future of Azeroth is secured. I am yours to command, Farseer. "
2847,The Calm After the Storm,Bring the Doomstone to Neptulon in the Maelstrom. ,"You have saved the elements from the Legion's control, and for that we thank you. However, it came at a great cost to both your health and your fellow shaman. Many came back to us wounded, dragged along by their fellow shaman. We have seen the havoc the Doomstone can wreak. It does not belong in the hands of any being, mortal or otherwise. While you were asleep, the elemental lords and I discussed its fate. Bring it to Neptulon. He will explain. "
2848,Breaking Chains,Free 8 Captured Grimtotem from Prison Cages. ,"The Legion shall not make fools of the Grimtotem. Free my people, and we will grace you with our aid in the coming battle. "

The way you lead our order with courage and determination inspires us all with hope. Yet, I fear that the worst is still ahead of us. You should not bear this burden alone.

However, the way you have championed the Earthen Ring and united the Elemental Lords. . . it has been an honor to behold. You truly are a great leader. The leader our order needs! Though the elements are united against the Burning Legion, our work is not yet done. If you should have need of my abilities, you need only ask. I live to serve the Earthen Ring! "
2851,The Firelord's Command,Defeat the forces of Pyroth. ,"Greetings, mortal. I am Scaldius, emissary of Lord Smolderon. I have just met with others from your order. They tell me that you will bring an end to those who oppose my master. This pleases Lord Smolderon. Pyroth and his minions defy my master's rule and so an example must be made of them. You will slay Pyroth and his champions! Nothing is more humiliating than death at the hands of a mortal. Do this and Lord Smolderon will grant you audience. "
2852,Mission: Elemental Diplomacy,"Successfully complete the ""Elemental Diplomacy"" mission. ","The Lord of Tides has united with the Earthen Ring, but the matter of uniting the remaining Elemental Lords still remains. For the next step of our campaign, I have organized a diplomatic mission to Skywall. The goal of the mission is to ascertain the current political situation in Skywall, following the defeat of Al'Akir the Windlord, and to identify any elementals who would aid our cause. The mission is currently waiting your assignment. "
2853,Recruiting The Troops,Speak to Summoner Morn and summon a Lesser Elemental. ,"Our champions acquired the talents of Summoner Morn, a powerful shaman. He is known for his strong affinity with earth, and is a valuable addition to our Order. He is already beginning to requisition Lesser Elementals to our cause.

Avalanchion go with Farseer. . . make demons cry. "
2855,Destroying the Cult,Slay 15 Twilight's Hammer cultists at The Twilight Throne. ,We are all that stands between the Twilight's Hammer and their conquest of Deepholm. Azeroth cannot hope to fight the full strength of the Twilight's Hammer and the Burning Legion at the same time. It is up to us to put an end to their cult before they are able to fully rebuild. Accompany me into their stronghold and we shall cut through their ranks together! 
2856,Held Captive! ,Rescue 10 Twilight Slaves from the Twilight Depths. ,"There are prisoners here, Farseer <name>, that are enslaved by the Twilight's Hammer. The cultists work them to death in the depths of the mine. I cannot abide such cruel mistreatment! Let us clear a path through the mine and rescue any Twilight's Hammer prisoners we find, so that they may return to their homes and families. The Twilight's Hammer will pay for their crimes! "
2857,Summoner Morn,"Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Morn Needs Help"". ","Now that we have recruited champions of our order, we can use the Scouting Map to complete vital assignments across the Broken Isles. The first assignment is critical. Summoner Morn, a renowned master of the elementals, was on his way to the Heart of Azeroth when he was attacked. I suggest we send Stormcaller Mylra to help him. She will be uniquely suited to this task. "
2858,Champion: Celestos,The Windlord has commanded that I shall assist the Earthen Ring in your campaign against the Burning Legion. ,"The Windlord has commanded that I shall assist the Earthen Ring in your campaign against the Burning Legion. Lord Thunderaan sees great potential in you, Farseer. As thanks for your help in securing his return as Windlord, he has granted you my services here in the mortal realm. When the time for battle approaches, the armies of Skywall will be at your back. "
2859,The Master's Plan,Collect the excerpts from The Master's Journal. ,"The purpose of the Twilight's Hammer has always been the same. They seek to bring about the end of the world. Their schemes may change, but their wicked purpose remains constant. Defeating the Twilight's Hammer is not simply a matter of defeating them in battle. If we are to be successful, we will need to uncover their scheme and put an end to whatever terrible plans they have created. Let us start by searching the encampment for clues as to their true purpose here. "
2860,Champion: Nobundo,"Your leadership during this time of crisis has been inspiring, Farseer &lt; name&gt; . ","Your leadership during this time of crisis has been inspiring, Farseer <name>. It was truly an honor to journey with you through Skywall. Although there are many matters here that require my attention, it would be an honor to fight at your side once again. Should you have need of my aid once again, I will be yours to command. "
2861,Champion: Tess Greymane,"You've proven your expertise to me many times over, Shadowblade. ","You've proven your expertise to me many times over, Shadowblade. While my colleagues have already pledged their service to you, I took a step back. Though all rogues step in the shadows, it is of vital importance that my status remains truly secret. However, the threat is too great. We are so close to taking the Legion down. . . and I want to take on a greater role in it. "
2862,"Rise, Champions",Recruit Stormcaller Mylra and Duke Hydraxis. ,"The Earthen Ring is built upon the strength and dedication of its members. If we are to help defend this world against the Burning Legion, we will need to grow our order, and recruit skilled champions to our side. Begin by speaking to Stormcaller Mylra and Duke Hydraxis. Perhaps they would be willing to fight for us. "
2863,Champion: Scaldius,The Firelord has commanded me to aid the mortals in their battle against the Burning Legion. ,The Firelord has commanded me to aid the mortals in their battle against the Burning Legion. My master has decreed that demon invaders have no place upon this world. I live to destroy the enemies of my master. I will obey your commands as though they are the Firelord's himself. Who shall I destroy first? 
2864,Champion: Lilian Voss,"You made quick work of those demons, and I hope you do the same to many more. ","You made quick work of those demons, and I hope you do the same to many more. So long as the Legion extends their influence on our world, they will continue to corrupt our people as well. I would like to continue to work with you to end this madness. My blades are yours, Shadowblade. "
2865,The Crone's Wrath,Defeat 15 demons on Darkcloud Pinnacle. ,"These demons come into my home, take my things, and capture my people? They will see my wrath. Destroy them, child. Surely you are capable of at least that. "
2866,Traversing the Heavens,Escort Farseer Nobundo through the Vortex Pinnacle. ,"If you are not opposed, <name>, I would accompany you on your journey through Skywall. There are wonders here that my eyes have never before beheld, and it would be my great honor to join you. Our quest to resurrect the mighty Thunderaan and unite the four great elemental lords will be no easy task. Lead the way, Farseer, and I shall follow. "
2867,The Rival Lords of Fire,Return to Lord Smolderon with Garixxia's Smoldering Heart and the Core of Molten Rage. ,"You stand before the true Lord of the Firelands, mortal. This land is mine by right, claimed from the ashes of Ragnaros himself. However, there are still some who foolishly oppose my reign. I would take great pleasure in destroying their worthless souls, but I will not honor them with death by my hands. They must be humiliated for their insolence, and there is nothing more humiliating than being slain by a mere mortal. Amuse me shaman. Prove your worth and destroy my rivals! "
2868,Expending Fel Energy,Harness the power of the Fel Crystals and expend their energy by killing demons within Faronaar. ,"Soon Kanrethad's banishment will fade, and he will return to our world. 

We must keep him, and his power, out of the Legion's hands at any cost.

If my old friend is still in there somewhere, perhaps we can bring him back.

The crystals you recovered feed on fel energy. We can use the ravenous crystals to siphon away the magic that consumes Kanrethad.

But first, their power must be depleted. To do so, you will need to harness the power of the crystals and use their energy to kill demons. "
2869,Answers Unknown,Find Jubeka Shadowbreaker within Azsuna. ,"Have you noticed a change in Jubeka's demeanor? I know she's not the warmest of warlocks, but I fear she's been more withdrawn than usual. I imagine her mind lingers on Kanrethad, the council's one-time leader. Jubeka was steadfast in her commitment to keeping him banished, until the Burning Legion took her as their prisoner. His fate is unknown, and it's clearly troubling our friend. The last thing she said to me, was that she felt his presence in Azsuna. Don't let her travel this path alone. "
2870,Black Rook Hold: An Unclaimed Soul,Collect an Unclaimed Soul from The Amalgam of Souls in the Black Rook Hold dungeon. ,"In order to create the anchor, we'll need to link something of Shinfel's to an unclaimed soul.

The soul will act like a beacon, guiding Shinfel through the Twisting Nether, and back to Dreadscar Rift.

Shinfel's staff should provide us with the link we need, but the soul will be a bit harder to find. 

Dwelling within Black Rook hold is an amalgam of souls, some lost and forgotten. Killing this monstrosity should provide us with the soul we need. "
2871,"Rise, Champions",Recruit Calydus and Ritssyn Flamescowl. ,"Friend is in a powerful, but lonely position. First of a council whose members are missing. Friend does not have to be alone though. Others will be drawn to friend's power, willing to follow if friend leads. Find those who want to help, and accept their pledge of loyalty. "
2872,Soul Beacon,Perform a ritual of summoning to retrieve the missing council member. ,"I have bound Shinfel's soul to her staff, allowing it to serve as an anchor in this world.

When we perform the ritual of summoning, it will act as a beacon, guiding Shinfel through the Twisting Nether and back to our world. "
2873,One Who's Worthy,"Interact with the Scouting Map and complete the missions, ""One Who's Worthy"". ","If we wish to successfully summon the sisters, we'll need the help of a warlock who is skilled in summoning greater demons.

We cannot afford to lose another council member due to inexperience. 

The Broken Isles are swarming with new blood, all hoping to make a name for themselves in this time of chaos. 

Hopefully among them we can find one worthy of this council. "
2874,A Mutual Friend,Return to Calydus within Dreadscar Rift. ,"It's good to see you are well.

I've been sent by our mutual friend, Calydus. He is eager to speak with you.

Please return to Dreadscar Rift at your earliest convenience. "
2875,Champion: Kanrethad Ebonlocke,"Although my recollection of recent events is still a bit hazy, the power you displayed when dispatching Rezara was something I could never forget. ","Although my recollection of recent events is still a bit hazy, the power you displayed when dispatching Rezara was something I could never forget. It seems fitting that the council chose you as its leader in my absence. Rest assured, I have no desire to challenge their decision. I owe you my life. Let me serve you and the council. There is much we can learn from each other. "
2876,Let it Feed,Kill demons throughout the Broken Isles and collect their blood. ,"We can use the Bloodstone to control the sisters once they are in a weakened state, but first, we'll need to feed it.

The stone grows in power when consuming the blood of demons. Luckily for us, there's no shortage of demons to kill. "
2877,Finding Fizzlebang,Find Lulubelle Fizzlebang in Stormheim. ,"I have reason to believe that Wilfred Fizzlebang's sister has made her way to Stormheim.

If she has half his power, but at least twice his intelligence, then we just might succeed in summoning the eredar twins. "
2878,Searching the Archives,"Interact with the Dreadscar Battle Plans and complete the mission ""Searching the Archives"". ","The Black Harvest archives contain an immeasurable amount of magical knowledge that has been collected from various sources over time. 

It's reasonable to think that somewhere among the countless scrolls that we'll find something to aid us in our mission to rescue the remaining council members. 

The search may be exhausting, but it is necessary if we plan to rebuild and face the Burning Legion. "
2879,Empowering the Soul,Collect Empowered Soul Shards by completing class hall missions. ,"Creating the anchor will require more power than our soul shards will be able to provide.

Dreadscar's troops are capable of amassing a large amount of soul shards when they defeat enemies while on missions. Once we have enough, I can harvest the supply and use them to craft the anchor. "
2880,Unparalleled Power,Complete 10 World Quests. ,"Power is all around us, <name>, waiting to be harnessed. You must venture out into the world and claim it for the council! With our First wielding such unparalleled power, our enemies won't stand a chance. "
2881,Borrowed Time,Give the Elixir of Suspension to Shinfel Blightsworn. ,"Don't let the aroma deceive you, this concoction is mostly safe for consumption.

Whoever is afflicted should drink the entire contents of the vial, every last drop! If the elixir works, the effects should be immediate. If not, well. . . just tell them they drink at their own risk, alright?

Keep in mind, this will only weaken the curse, not cure it. "
2882,Information at Any Cost,"Use the Dreadscar Battle Plans and complete the mission ""Information at Any Cost"". ","Now that you've found other warlocks that are willing to aid your cause, we can use the Dreadscar Battle Plans to complete vital assignments across the Broken Isles. If we wish to rebuild the council, we must start by locating its missing members. Let us send Ritssyn and Calydus to interrogate the Burning Legion's minions. They might have information that will help us locate the missing council members. "
2883,Champion: Lulubelle Fizzlebang,"I don't have to hide away in shame anymore, and I have you to thank for that. ","I don't have to hide away in shame anymore, and I have you to thank for that. It's a debt I doubt I'll ever be able to repay, but I'd like to try. "
2884,Champion: Eredar Twins,"We live to serve you, &lt; name&gt; . ","We live to serve you, <name>. It would please us to do your bidding. "
2885,Summoning the Sisters,Travel through the Demonic Gateway to reach the summoning platform and use the Bloodstone to subdue the eredar sisters once the summoning is complete. ,"It would be best to conduct the summoning on the outskirts of Dreadscar Rift. If things do not go as planned, at least the aftermath will be contained to a small island of land that floats above our order. Once the sisters have been summoned, use the Bloodstone to enslave them. I'll let the others know it's time to begin. "
2886,A Daring Rescue,Enter the demon world and rescue the missing council members. ,"The plan is a simple one, but it will require great effort on your part.

Kira and I will summon the demonic gateway, but you will have to enter alone and recover the missing council members. "
2887,The Path of the Dreadscar,Use the Dreadscar Battle Plans to choose your first zone. ,"It would seem that where the council has failed, you have found untold success. These Dreadscar should prove powerful allies, but they may not be enough.

For now, we must look to rebuild. I will send agents out to locate the whereabouts of the captured council members, as well as any other warlocks who may be able to aid the cause.

Meet me at the scrying pool, and we will plan our action from there. "
2888,Rebuilding the Council,Resurrect Ritssyn Flamescowl in Dreadscar Rift. ,"It seems that friend has caught the attention of Mephistroth. This is very bad news, as the dreadlord will surely wish to seek revenge for losing his general.

Friend will need more than the Dreadscar to stand against him, you will need powerful warlocks such as those who were captured. Calydus thinks the orc still lies in the pit where you were chained. Friend must revive him, and rebuild the council! "
2889,Tech It Up A Notch,Speak to Archivist Melinda in Dreadscar Rift. ,"We are very fortunate to have come across Archivist Melinda. She is somewhat of an anomaly, as not many from her race choose our path. What makes her even more unique is her meticulous study of our craft. Her knowledge will be unsurpassed. Speak to her now and seek her council. With her help, we can surely strengthen the council. "
2890,Crystal Containment,Meet Jubeka Shadowbreaker in Dreadscar Rift. ,"Kanrethad will be safe in my care, but something must be done about these crystals that hold his fel magic.

If any should break, the energy inside would find its way back to our friend. I shouldn't need to tell you how devastating it would be if that were to happen.

I will gather the crystals and meet you back at Dreadscar Rift. "
2891,Stealing the Source of Power,Collect 5 Fel Crystals. ,"My prisoner is a chatty one, <name>. He tells me that the Cult of the Green Flame is harnessing fel energy to fuel their efforts of bringing Kanrethad back from banishment.

Within their compound they are powering fel crystals that can hold a great amount of fel magic. Without the proper power to perform their ritual, the occultists will have a tough time succeeding in their task.

Steal their fel crystals, but don't destroy them. We can always find a use for something so powerful. "
2892,Vault of the Wardens: Matters of the Heart,Collect a Felsworn Heart from Cordana within The Vault of the Wardens dungeon. ,"I have made considerable progress with the Bloodstone, thanks in part to your extensive testing.

The stone feeds on blood to grow in power, but its ability to control a demon comes from consuming a corrupted heart; the more powerful, the better.

Within the Vault of the Wardens you'll find someone with such a heart. "
2893,Someone Else's Mess,Banish demons that have been irresponsibly summoned in Stormheim. ,"A confession alone won't be enough to clear my name. As long as those demons run amuck, people will blame their presence on me. 

Someone needs to clean up the mess that warlock made. I'd do it myself, but I can't be placed at the scene of the crime.

You could banish them though. That would do the trick. Use this orb on newly summoned demons to send them right back where they came from - permanently! "
2894,Gazing Into Oblivion,Accept a gift from the Council of the Black Harvest. ,"<name>, your wisdom and leadership inspires awe in all of us!

The Council of the Black Harvest is prepared to furnish you with a full set of armor to aid in the fight against the Burning Legion. Continue expanding your influence across the Broken Isles, and we may yet achieve victory. "
2895,Bloodstone Bandit,Recover Kira's Bloodstone from Narashi Spitescale. ,"Something of personal value has been taken from me, and my work here cannot continue until I get it back.

To most it would appear to be an ordinary stone, but it is so much more than a simple rock - it lives and breathes!

The nearby naga have been snatching anything with any sort of magical significance, my stone included. Fortunately, they do not know how to access its power.

Return my stone to me, and I will consider your request for help. "
2896,Troops in the Field,"Use the Dreadscar Battle Plans and complete the mission, ""Troops in Training"". ",It's time to send our newly trained imps out into the field. Look at the Dreadscar Battle Plans and send your champions and troops on a routine scouting mission. 
2897,An Unlikely Ally,Speak to Kira Iresoul in Azsuna. ,"Channeling the demonic gateway will require the assistance of someone with intimate knowledge of the Burning Legion.

I know of such a warlock, though I imagine her blood still boils upon hearing my name. It might be best if you are the one to request her help. "
2898,Champion: Kanrethad Ebonlocke,"I remember you, &lt; name&gt; . ","I remember you, <name>. We met long ago within the Black Temple. How could I forget such power? It seems fitting that the council chose you as its leader in my absence. Rest assured, I have no desire to challenge their decision. I owe you my life. Let me serve you and the council. There is much we can learn from each other. "
2899,To the Broken Shore,Head to the Broken Shore. ,"It would seem that Kanrethad's twisted followers have begun their ritual on the Broken Shore. We must act quickly. The Burning Legion cannot be allowed to use Kanrethad as their weapon. We have acolytes on standby, ready to perform a ritual of summoning on the Broken Shore when you're ready. "
2900,Debt Repaid,Speak to Ritssyn Flamescowl. ,"I have a few urgent matters to take care of, but soon after I will make my way to Dreadscar Rift and aid you with your summoning.

You should warn Ritssyn to keep his distance. I'll be there to repay my debt to you, not to speak to the hypocrite who chose the council over his friends. "
2901,Herding Goats,"Catch Greyhorn Goats, then return them to their pen. ","In case you haven't noticed, things are a bit hectic around here.

Marl's doing a good job protecting the corn fields, but the commotion gave our goats quite the scare. They dashed out of their pen as soon as the fighting started, and are now running amuck!

Round them up for me and I'll do my best to figure out how to handle the curse you're dealing with. "
2902,Coercing a Confession,Find the warlock that has been irresponsibly summoning demons and obtain a written confession of his wrongdoings. ,"My location has to be kept secret, at least until I have proof of my innocence.

Thanks to the legacy of my family name, any time some miserable warlock summons demons they can't control, I get the blame.

The scene of my latest ""crime"" is a nearby cave, where unruly imps and other nasty demons are roaming free.

Find the lousy warlock who's responsible, and get him to write a confession. "
2903,Lulubelle on Loan,Speak to Ritssyn Flamescowl. ,"What you plan to do is pretty risky, you know? Summoning one sister would be difficult enough, but both of them at once? That's just asking for trouble.

Luckily, I'm up for the challenge. I'll help you and the rest of the council summon those demons, and hopefully restore pride to the Fizzlebang name. "
2904,Champion: Shinfel Blightsworn,"So Ritssyn appointed you First of our council, did he? It seems much has changed in the short time I've been gone. ","So Ritssyn appointed you First of our council, did he? It seems much has changed in the short time I've been gone. The Legion threat is greater than ever. I have witnessed their power firsthand, and know that we cannot defeat them as we are now. You will unite us, <name>, and together we will strip the Legion of their power! "
2905,Mad Ernie the Alchemist,Find Mad Ernie the Alchemist in Val'sharah. ,"If we have any hope of curing this curse, we need to know what kind of magic we're dealing with.

I know of an alchemist who earned himself quite the reputation for his unconventional methods. Shunned from Gilneas long ago, I believe Mad Ernie has taken up residence in these lands.

His knowledge may be the first step to breaking this curse. "
2906,Recruiting More Troops,Speak to Recruiter Jared. ,"As First of the council, you have acolytes devoted to helping any way they can. Recruiter Jared is in charge of screening candidates, only selecting those that possess the skills we desire. Speak to him now. "

2908,Doom and Gloom,Recover the ingredients Ernest needs to create an Elixir of Suspension. ,"Doom curses are serious business, so much so that many warlocks didn't deal in them for some time. 

The magic grows stronger as time goes on, eventually leading to death. Only the caster of the curse can remove it.

I can craft an elixir that will slow its progression, but you'll need to collect an assortment of ingredients first. "
2909,It Hungers for Blood,Let the Bloodstone feed on the blood of demons. ,"Bloodstones contain a great deal of power that can only be awakened once they are fed. 

Yet this stone does not feast on fish and cakes. It hungers for blood; the more powerful, the better.

There's an infestation of demons just east of here. I need you to nourish my stone with their blood, so that I may unlock its power. "
2910,Champion: Jubeka Shadowbreaker,"We have to stop meeting like this, &lt; name&gt; . ","We have to stop meeting like this, <name>. You've saved me more times than I care to admit. If you in turn ever need saving, I'll be there to return the favor. "
2911,The Fate of Kanrethad,Use the Fel Crystals to siphon fel energy from Kanrethad. ,"I can feel his presence, Netherlord! Kanrethad is here! His followers have set up camp in the nearby pass, and are performing the ritual to bring him back as we speak. Quickly, take the fel crystals. Arrange them in a circle around Kanrethad. If placed correctly, the crystals should link together and begin to siphon the fel energy. Now go, before it's too late! "

2999,In Service Of The Lich King,Report to Instructor Razuvious in the Heart of Acherus. ,"All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the Scourge. Gaze now upon the lands below us. The Scarlet Crusade scurries to undo my work, while Light's Hope stands defiantly against us - a blemish upon these Plaguelands. They must all be shown the price of their defiance. You will become my force of retribution. Where you tread, doom will follow. Go now and claim your destiny, death knight. "
3000,Death Comes From On High,"The Lich King commands you to use the Eye of Acherus to analyze the Scarlet Hold, New Avalon Forge, New Avalon Town Hall and the Chapel of the Crimson Flame. ","Towering above this platform is the eye of Acherus. From it you will call forth a probe that you will then use to analyze Scarlet Crusade fortifications at New Avalon. The eye has a host of powers that should make the acquisition of this data simple. Use the eye's siphon to analyze the forge, town hall, hold, and chapel. The eye's control mechanisms are located on either side of this platform. Waste no more time, <name>. The Scourge will have this place. The Lich King commands it! "

Perhaps he'll find it useful. "
3002,Brothers In Death,Search for Koltira Deathweaver in the Scarlet Hold. ,"Breaking through the Scarlet lines was no easy task. We suffered many casualties during the assault and lost one of our best death knights, Koltira Deathweaver. I don't know whether he's dead or alive, but I'll be damned if we don't search for him. I last saw him being bound in irons and dragged away to the Scarlet Hold, northeast of here. Tear that keep asunder, death knight. Find Koltira! "
3003,Into the Realm of Shadows,Salanar the Horseman at Death's Breach has challenged you to slay the Dark Rider of Acherus and take his Acherus Deathcharger. ,"The horse you stole has been taken to the Realm of Shadows. It is there that my dark rider will slay the beast and raise it as a deathcharger. Do you think yourself brave enough to enter the Realm of Shadows in pursuit of the deathcharger? If you accept, I will transport you to the shadow world. Once there, seek out a dark rider in the open fields south of us.

3006,The Eye Of Acherus,Report to the Lich King in Ebon Hold. ,"Behold, Acherus, the grand citadel of death! It has no equal in this world! Not even the mighty Naxxramas could withstand a direct assault from the Ebon Hold. Looming above the face of the necropolis is the all-seeing eye of Acherus.

The Lich King has called for you, <name>. Go now! Suffer well, <brother/sister>. . . "
3007,Lambs To The Slaughter,Baron Rivendare at the Crypt of Remembrance has commanded you to slay 10 Scarlet Crusade Soldiers and 15 Citizens of New Avalon. ,"Most humans would have fled the moment a Scourge necropolis took up residence in their air space. Not the Scarlet Crusade! I must confess - I rather enjoy our exchanges with the Crusade. Through the years, Scourge battles against them have resulted in several of the most tragic events in human history. Yet here we stand - AGAIN - locked in battle!

","We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house. We weren't expecting what we found in there, <name>. Seems the Crusade's been real busy. That whole thing is full of Argent Dawn prisoners. Most of them were already dead by the time we arrived, but a few were still breathing. I was about to go in there and execute the rest of them, but I think you should have the honors. In particular, there's a real feisty Forsaken in there that I think you'll take great pleasure in executing. "

Notice anything missing? Of course you don't, because you're a moron! Your brain was probably the first thing to die. <Noth sighs. >I have been commanded to put together a plague cauldron. You will help me. Directly inside the gate of New Avalon is the inn. Enter the inn and steal an empty cauldron. Then go to the forge, also near the gate, and steal some iron chains.

3015,Tonight We Dine In Havenshire,Orithos the Sky Darkener at Death's Breach wants you to recover 15 Saronite Arrows. ,"The Sky Darkeners are mindless constructs with one purpose: KILL! Specifically, they are aiming to kill any man or woman that they see fleeing Havenshire for the safety of New Avalon. We certainly can't allow those cowards to make it to safety and then take up arms against us! There is one slight problem. They use saronite arrows for maximum range and damage. Saronite, however, is a metal only found in Northrend, so supplies are limited! Retrieve those arrows for me and I will reward you handsomely. "
3016,"If Chaos Drives, Let Suffering Hold The Reins",Prince Valanar at Death's Breach commands you to slay 10 Scarlet Crusaders or Scarlet Peasants and 10 Citizens of Havenshire. ,"They make their stand now, outside of Death's Breach, futilely attempting to push us back in hopes of saving their horses, mines, lumber and citizens. This will be your first lesson in Scourge warfare: TERROR! Go to the front lines, south of here, and destroy Scarlet Crusaders. Leave their corpses so that we may utilize them for the death march.

It's your life or theirs! . ,"The endless hunger will soon take hold of you, <class>. When it does, you will feel pain immeasurable.

We do not want to draw their suspicion. They must continue under the assumption that everything is going as they planned. You will don the Scarlet courier's clothes and with the help of some dark magic, take on the form of the courier. Abbendis is at King's Harbor, southeast of the Scarlet Overlook. Drop off the message and get as much information out of her as you can. She will tell us what we need to know about the ""Crimson Dawn. """

3023,The Will Of The Lich King,Return to Death's Breach and report to Prince Valanar. ,"It is the will of the Lich King that drives us onward, <name>. None are more aware of this than death knights. Our very existence is intrinsically tied to his consciousness. Surely you have heard him speak to you - invading your thoughts. . . Can you hear him now?

3025,Noth's Special Brew,Place the Pile of Crusader Skulls inside the Plague Cauldron. ,"The cauldron is ready to begin spewing its foul corruption across the land! Now, death knight, a brief lesson in plague cauldrons. The gas that the cauldron emits is deadly to the living, but empowers Scourge.

My final judgment has been passed: Death. To. All. None shall stand so boldly against the might of the Scourge without reprisal! As you have served me well in your first task, so too shall you serve me in your next task. Take my judgment to Highlord Mograine at the command post of Acherus, found on the first floor. Tell him to begin the assault. And when the Crusade has been dealt with, we will finish off the Argent Dawn. "

Troubling times come. As one of the chosen few, it is both your burden and privilege to defend our world. It is a great honor.

They have diverted all forces outside of New Avalon to set up a blockade at Light's Point, east of here.

It's a gamble bringing them here. . . they used to be part of the Burning Legion after all. But, they are some of the most powerful in Lord Illidan's arsenal.

I have a feeling that the ultimate sacrifice is going to have to be made in order to summon them in. "
3048,Hidden No More,Kill Fel Lord Caza and take his fel power. ,"Now that you've uncovered the demons, I can sense them, too. Specifically, I sense a very powerful fel lord deeper in the cave. You need to grab his power while you still can.

3052,Fel Secrets,Read the Tome of Fel Secrets to choose between the Havoc and Vengeance specializations. ,"The demons made a grave error inscribing their secrets into this book. The fel energy emanating from it is potent.

As an added benefit, you can steal his demonic power. "
3059,Eye On the Prize,Kill Inquisitor Baleful and take his power. ,"This demon has proved less than useful. I have been using the Scythe of Souls on it, but so far, it has resisted my inquiries. We will see how long that lasts.

I have a different idea. . .

There is a fresh inquisitor demon ahead. They are horrific fel casters who see through their floating eyes and specialize in dark pacts. If you steal its power, Jace Darkweaver could use some of it in his ritual to spy on the Legion.

Better yet, you will gain its power by ripping it from its smoking corpse. "
3060,Breaking Out,Free both Altruis the Sufferer and Kayn Sunfury. ,"We cannot fight our way out of the Vault alone.

Two of your allies, Kayn Sunfury and Altruis the Sufferer, are imprisoned within this room. 

Free them with haste. Their strength will be of great use to us. "
3061,Vengeance Will Be Mine! ,Teach the Vengeance specialization to your assembled demon hunters. ,"This is why the Legion fears us. We have the ability to turn their secrets against them and in so doing become stronger than they ever can be.

Quickly, <name>, teach us what you have learned. "
3062,A Weapon of the Alliance,Meet with the Illidari in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. ,"At first I was unsure whether it was wise to allow the Illidari inside the city. But you may have just saved all our lives. You may establish a camp in the Mage Quarter. The Alliance will have need of your skills if we are to face the Legion. Make no mistake though. Should your kind give in to the fel energies you toy with, we will treat you like the demons you are becoming. "
3063,Between Us and Freedom,Kill Bastillax and take his power. ,"The last of our survivors have fought their way into the final chamber ahead.

Only one obstacle stands between us and the vault's exit - the leader of this demon invasion, Bastillax.

Kill him, take his power, and claim our freedom. "
3064,The Imp Mother's Tome,Obtain the Tome of Fel Secrets. ,"See this giant cave? There's a terrifyingly powerful imp mother inside.

But that's not the good part. The good part is what she has.

Apparently, she's some kind of keeper of fel secrets. She's in there performing profane Legion rites and scribing them into a book.

We need that power! We need her tome! "
3065,Meeting With the Queen,Complete the ritual to spy upon the Legion leaders. ,"We can use some of that essence to complete my ritual. You'll be able to spy upon the Legion leaders and see what they're planning.

Kor'vas has gone out to find that demon and bring those secrets back for us. "
3067,Second Sight,Use your Spectral Sight. ,"Though young King Anduin is a noble soul, he may lack the conviction of his father. The Alliance needs a leader who will do what needs to be done. The Legion will strike at the first hint of weakness. Even now, I sense something amiss, <name>. I fear that not all is as it seems. Quickly, use your Spectral Sight. We must know if there are foes among us! "
3068,Set Them Free,Several of your demon hunters are in trouble. ,"Cyana went down to the Molten Shore. She was going to help some of the demon hunters who came in through the gateway ahead of us. Instead, she got herself into trouble.

This inquisitor revealed they're being held prisoner by some new type of demon called a 'jailer'. The thing sucks the souls out of its victims. I doubt they can hold out much longer. "
3069,On Felbat Wings,Grab a felbat from Illidari Whitemoon and fly up to the Fel Hammer. ,"It is time. We have dealt the Legion's forces a crippling blow from which they will never recover.

Quickly, let us mount up and take the fight to Tyranna's command center. "

3072,Enter the Illidari: Coilskar,Feed a soul into the Legion Gateway Activator and then use it to summon in your Coilskar forces. ,"The next gateway's down on the Molten Shore. Our Coilskar forces are waiting at the Black Temple on the other side.

Personally, I wouldn't have chosen to bring our naga allies. But, their leader did swear fealty to Lord Illidan. I suppose we'll see.

We'll have to find a way to power the gateway's activator. Like this last gateway, it runs on souls.

<Allari the Souleater grins as Sevis says this. >"
3073,Enter the Illidari: Ashtongue,Summon in your Ashtongue forces by activating the Legion Gateway. ,"Lord Illidan has placed you in charge. Now, we just need the rest of our Illidari attack force.

There are three Burning Legion gateways ahead. Activate them and our Illidari will pour through from the Black Temple.

Like most Legion constructs, the gateways are powered by souls. I think we have provided enough to activate this first one, don't you? Let us bring in our Ashtongue forces. "
3074,Cry Havoc and Let Slip the Illidari! ,Teach the Havoc specialization to your assembled demon hunters. ,This is why the Legion fears us. We have the ability to turn their secrets against them and in so doing become stronger than they ever can be. 
3076,Stop Gul'dan! ,"Enter the Vault of the Betrayer, kill Crusher and Sledge, and take their fel power. ","After his defeat at the Black Temple, we brought Illidan's lifeless body here, to be interred forever within the Vault of the Wardens.

Gul'dan has found his way through our defenses and is trying to steal the Betrayer's corpse.

Even in death, Illidan's body can be used by the Burning Legion. Gul'dan CANNOT succeed. "
3077,All The Way Up,Ride the elevator to the Hall of Judgment. ,"Kor'vas went ahead to meet up with Kayn and Altruis.

Step onto the elevator when it arrives, and meet them in the Hall of Judgment above. "
3078,Rise of the Illidari,Free 8 Illidari Prisoners. ,"Look down there. We are vastly outnumbered.

We will need more allies on our side if we are to escape from here intact. Free the other Illidari imprisoned within the cells of this chamber.

We will need everyone to escape this place alive. "
3079,Frozen in Time,Activate the Countermeasures in the Vault of Ice. ,"The Wardens kept all kinds of dangerous monsters locked up within this Vault. Now that Gul'dan's forces have breached the walls, it's proving rather. . . inconvenient.

Many of our forces are occupied with containing a fearsome magma destroyer in the southern chamber. With us freshly awoken from stasis, we don't have the means to take it down. However, we might be able to reactivate the room's containment field.

Go join up with Kayn. Do whatever it takes to seal that chamber! "
3080,"Illidari, We Are Leaving",Speak to Archmage Khadgar. ,"The Legion has begun its invasion of our world. Across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, brave defenders are answering the call to arms.
 
However, they will ultimately fail without your aid. You Illidari were uniquely trained as weapons against the Legion.

I only ask that you come with me. Further instructions await you on the other side. "
3081,Demons Among Them,Protect the King. ,"It is just as we suspected, <name>! The demons thought they could take us by surprise. Quickly, to arms! Warn the King! "
3082,Grand Theft Felbat,Ride a felbat to the upper vault. ,"You heard what Maiev said. We need to get out of here.

There is an elevator shaft at the far end of these caverns. Let us make our way there. "

Kill him, take his power, and claim our freedom. "
3084,Their Numbers Are Legion,Wage war upon the Brood Queen's Court and the Burning Legion within the greater Inferno Peak area. ,"Yes, those devastators must be silenced, but there's also a great deal more to be done.

Despite the odds, we're counting on you. The Brood Queen's primary leaders are in control of the volcano. They must be killed. We must smash the Legion and do anything else necessary to achieve absolute victory. "
3086,Forged in Fire,Kill Immolanth and take his power. ,"The fearsome demon, Immolanth, led a Legion army that conquered and eventually ruled a distant nexus world. 

Somehow, the Wardens imprisoned him, then kept him locked up in the chamber to our left. He is contained, but not for long.

The demon's power is a valuable prize to any demon hunter who can defeat him. Whoever can do so will gain power beyond imagining.

I believe that person could be you, <name>. "
3087,Stop Gul'dan! ,"Enter the Vault of the Betrayer, kill Crusher and Sledge, and take their fel power. ","After his defeat at the Black Temple, we brought Illidan's lifeless body here, to be interred forever within the Vault of the Wardens.

3088,Our Last Hope,Speak with Maiev Shadowsong in the Illidari Cellblock. ,"Your jailor, Maiev Shadowsong, stands outside the open door to your cell. The leader of the Wardens has just finished removing your bonds.

3121,Our Last Hope,Retrieve your new warglaives. ,"The Vault has fallen to the Burning Legion.

It pains me to say it, but all is lost, but for one glimmer of hope. . . YOU. Believe me when I say, I did NOT want to have to do this. However, it would seem I have no choice.

The shards you brought me should provide the means to bring down the barrier. Once it is done, we have to act quickly. We must restore the final ward before the Darkness can manifest.

Do not hesitate. The fate of Highmountain itself hangs in the balance. "
3293,Ice and Shadow,Collect 20 Shadowice Shards. ,"We took down one of the Necrodark. Ebonhorn found that it held a shard of ice infused with shadow essence.

Perhaps the villains are using these shards as a kind of talisman. I suggest you deprive them of their trinkets.

I know little of such magics, but it seemed that Ebonhorn had a use for them in mind. "
3294,How Fares Ebonhorn? ,Return to Thunder Totem and check on Ebonhorn. ,"Three of the ancient wards are restored. The mountain is not yet secure, but we may have done enough to break Ebonhorn free of the shadows gripping him.

The Warchief will be pleased. "
3296,Dark Tales,Meet Spiritwalker Graysky in Riverbend. ,"Spiritwalker Ebonhorn is stable. . . for now.

He once told me of the wards he maintains against the Old Gods. He placed them at key locations around this mountain, but kept them hidden from mortal eyes--even my own.

Incapacitated like this, his wards cannot hold back the evil ones. No doubt this is the reason for their attack.

To find the wards, we must enter the echoes of Ebonhorn's past and commune with the spirits we find there.

Meet me in Riverbend, <name>. It is there our search begins. "
3297,Shadow of the Sepulcher,Meet Spiritwalker Graysky in Sepulcher of the Sky. ,"Ebonhorn spoke of another ward safeguarding the lands of the Skyhorn tribe. Somewhere close to the Sepulcher of the Sky, he said. It was there that this ""Darkness"" once manifested.

3299,Whispers of the Darkness,Free 6 Highmountain Protectors. ,"Before our arrival, many of our own came to neutralize the threat here. They did not know what they were walking into.

Wake them from their stupor. Free them from the whispers any way you can. "
3300,Huln's Mountain,Meet Spiritwalker Graysky at Snowblind Mesa. ,"We have made progress reactivating the wards, but more must be done.

I sense Ebonhorn's struggle. Though he fights with all his strength, he is slipping away. Should this ""Darkness"" emerge into our realm, I fear our friend will be lost.

Ebonhorn spoke of another ward somewhere within Snowblind Mesa. Meet me there, so that I might guide you along another journey into the memories of the past. "
3301,Minions of the Darkness,Use the Water of Vision to walk in the memories of Oenia Skyhorn. ,"Oenia Skyhorn was a legendary chieftain of her tribe. Though she crossed over to the spirit realm long ago, her presence is still felt all around us.

Ebonhorn told me that Oenia placed a ward here to protect the people she cared for so deeply. . . perhaps from the specter of the Darkness.

Use the Water of Vision to journey into her echoes. Worry not that this ritual might disturb her rest. A hero like Oenia would relish a chance to aid us in the present. "
3302,The Darkness,Defeat Uul'gyneth the Darkness. ,"For thousands of years, the Darkness was held at bay. The wards stood. . . protecting Highmountain.

Now they are gone, and evil is free once more.

The Darkness that haunted our dreams. . . that even the kobolds spoke of only in frightened whispers. . . has come. Uul'gyneth, herald of the Old Gods, paves the way for his masters. Unless we stand together and defeat him, all is lost.

You must hold nothing back, champion. None of us can. "
3303,Servants of the Darkness,Use the Water of Vision to walk in the memories of Huln Highmountain. ,"The heroes of Highmountain's past placed wards to protect our land from the insidious Old Gods. The deeds of these noble champions kept us safe for thousands of years.

We must not fail their memory.

Huln Highmountain himself placed the ward here at Snowblind Mesa. It must be reactivated for us to have any hope of saving Ebonhorn.

Enter the echo of Huln's spirit, and let his courage lead you to the location of this ward. "
3304,Curse of the Necrodark,Journey to Highmountain Summit. ,"It is clear that the Old Gods have long sought to control Highmountain. Their covetous desire speaks to the power of this land, and the strength of the spirits that echo through its peaks and valleys.

They will not take our sacred mountain, <name>. Not while I draw breath.

With the Highmountain tribes united, and with Baine Bloodhoof at our side, we will defeat the Darkness. . . once and for all.

Come. Let us take back the summit from the forces that would corrupt it. "
3305,For the Horde,Meet Ambassador Blackguard at the Orgrimmar Embassy. ,"A new age dawns upon Highmountain, <name>.

After centuries apart, the bond with our kin from Kalimdor has been reforged. And in the fight to save our land, we found new friends among the people of the Horde.

As a lifetime of adventure unfolds before you, be assured that. . . uh. . .

You know what? I've been reading this same greeting all day. Enough's enough.

Talk to Chromie, she's on the hourglass, then talk to your emissary. Run along. "
3307,Drop It! ,Retrieve Chelsea Wright's keys. ,"You must be the person Dorian sent to collect the ore.

I got a message a short while ago requesting a rather large shipment, which in itself is a feat given the state of this place. I was on my way to our storehouse when that. . . beast! . . . cornered me.

It took my keys. I can't get you that shipment without them. Find out where that mongrel took them and bring them back.

Let it be known I wouldn't do this for anyone else. "
3308,Made in Kul Tiras,Speak to Cyrus in Boralus Harbor. ,"Are you curious about how the Kul Tirans joined the Alliance? 

It was assumed that Kul Tiras would rejoin the Alliance after everything that was done to stabilize their nation. Lady Jaina Proudmoore wanted to cement the allegiance by building King Anduin a ship worthy of the Kul Tiran navy.

She wished for help in finding the best shipwright in Kul Tiras, Dorian Atwater. It wouldn't be easy, as Dorian was retired.

It all began with a trip to see Cyrus in Boralus Harbor. . . "
3309,Blessing of the Tides,"Choose a name for the new vessel, then witness Brother Pike's blessing. ","Dorian certainly lives up to her reputation, <name>.

This magnificent vessel is complete and now it has a crew. Two pieces remain.

First, we must give the ship a name.

Then it falls to Brother Pike to bless this vessel. As is tradition, a tidesage's blessing fortifies the ship against storms and encourages fair weather and smooth seas. It is as much ceremonial as it is practical.

Once that is done, we will set sail for Stormwind. "
3310,Summons from Dorian,Return to Dorian Atwater at Port Fogtide. ,"<The elemental has a piece of parchment whipping around madly inside its tornado. >

The Wright family owned a mine up near Corlain. Years past, they supplied all the metal ore I used to build my ships.

I can't imagine they're faring too well, based on what we've seen here.

Find Chelsea Wright, the foreman's daughter, and see what they need to get another ore shipment together.

Just tell her Dorian sent you. "
3312,Heritage of the Kul Tiran,Meet Katherine Proudmoore in Boralus. ,"Gossip in Boralus has oft reached my ears of your exceptional conduct, <name>.

Meet me before the keep. I wish to commend your efforts on behalf of Kul Tiras. "
3313,The Master Shipwright,Acquire the Letter from the Lord Admiral and meet Cyrus Crestfall in Brennadam. ,"Now I am starting to remember. . .

Dorian Atwater was a very secretive builder. Their slips were famously warded against prying eyes until the vessel was complete. It made something of a stir any time one of their works was revealed.

Last I heard, they retired in Stormsong Valley. I am not certain how reliable that information is.

Hm. We should head to Brennadam. It is a crossroads of sorts. If anyone knows where to find our shipwright, they will be there. "
3314,Balance in All Things,Speak to Ulfar and cleanse the Filled Drust Vessel. ,"The confluence of energies around that vessel is truly disturbing. My skin crawls with the wrongness of it.

We have reached the limit of my ability to help you, <name>.

Go to Ulfar, the High Thornspeaker. Arthur will carry you, if you wish it.

Only he knows enough about these ancient magics to undo the corruption that taints your materials.

Go quickly. You do not want to hold that vessel longer than you must. "
3315,A Worthy Crew,Recruit a crew for the new vessel. ,"If Dorian really can build this ship before the day is out, we need to find a crew for the new vessel.

This crew should represent the best of Kul Tiran society, the highest naval prowess, and the faith of our people as we present this gift to Anduin.

I have a captain in mind, but you'll want to speak to him yourself. I will let him decide who else he wants aboard.

Seek out my brother, Tandred Proudmoore, in Boralus. He will help you fill out the ranks from there. "
3316,Allegiance of Kul Tiras,Sail to Stormwind Harbor and present Anduin with his gift. ,"It is time for her maiden voyage, <name>.

This aptly named vessel will carry us and her crew across the vast sea to Stormwind Harbor. There we will meet Anduin and I will seal the pact we made so many moons ago.

Kul Tiras will stand with the Alliance so long as I am Lord Admiral.

Thank you for your assistance in this endeavor. "

Hmm. . . Along the road to Fort Daelin. . . to the north. . . somewhere in the Deadwash.

I've marked a spot on your map that seems likely. I think that will get you close enough. 

I'll report back to the Lord Admiral with what we've learned. Good luck, and I hope our shipwright is willing. "
3318,Team Carry,Collect 4 heavy lumber and take it to the drop-off point. ,"Algerson is about as useful as a legless horse. We're going to do this ourselves.

The mill is overrun with bizarre creatures. I'll handle those. You and these hearty volunteers will need to be the muscle of this operation.

Don't look at me like that, <class>. It's just a little lifting.

Once we have enough lumber, Sal will meet us for a pick up. Just stay close to me and focus on not dropping my wood, yes? "
3319,This Lumber is Haunted,Seek out Thornspeaker Birchgrove in Gol Koval. ,"I don't much believe in ghosts, or hauntings for that matter.

That said, there is something wrong with this lumber. I can feel it in my bones. They're achier than normal.

I only know of one group that would know what to do. They're reclusive, but we share a love of nature.

Can't say I've had THAT request before.

<Dorian leans back in her chair for a moment and rubs at her eyes. >

I'm getting too old for this nonsense.

<Dorian heaves a long sigh. >

Go on out back and saddle Hurricane for me while I pack my things. We will meet you at Port Fogtide.

We're going to need a slip. "
3322,Gorak Tul's Influence,Fill the Drust Vessel in Gol Koval by killing enemies and destroying cairns. ,"Long have the Thornspeakers struggled against such magics. It is a conflict as old as the Drust themselves.

Gorak Tul's influence, however, has vastly shifted the balance toward that of decay and death. It corrupts what would be an ordinary curse.

I believe Ulfar can correct this.

Go into Gol Koval. Slay our enemies, destroy their cairns, and collect their magics into this vessel.

With it, Ulfar may be able to find a way to cleanse your materials. "
3323,Fish Tales and Distant Sails,Ask for information about the shipwright in Brennadam. ,"I have an idea where to start, but it couldn't hurt to ask the locals. 

I hope it goes without saying that you shouldn't believe everything you hear, <name>. My people are very fond of embellishing the truth.

I will meet you in The Golden Flagon when you've had a chance to ask around. "
3324,Covering Our Masts,Place 3 Fog Wards in Port Fogtide. ,"When I was younger, I hid my ships out of vanity.

I often went through a number of designs before I was satisfied. I didn't want anyone to see that. It might ruin the mystique, I reasoned.

Now. . . I think it best to hide this ship from the likes of those tentacle-faced creeps. I don't think they intend to let us build unchallenged.

Go into the port and place my wards around the main slip. 

You'll see what they do. "
3325,For the Alliance,Take the portal to Stormwind in the Sanctum of the Sages and meet with Ambassador Moorgard in the Stormwind Embassy. ,"Thank you for meeting with me, <name>.

I need representatives to go to Stormwind to represent our loyalty and commitment to our newly forged bond with the Alliance. 

I've had Yvia and her magi prepare a portal to the city for you in the Sanctum of the Sages. Once there, go to the Stormwind Embassy and meet with Ambassador Moorgard.

You will face many challenges on the long journey ahead. Remember where you came from and make your people proud! "
3326,Make it Wright,Collect Dorian's ore shipment. ,"<Chelsea stares in horror at the Wicker Beast. >

I don't know how this happened, or why. . . but I know this beast. 

<Chelsea hastily wipes away a tear. >

I've unlocked our storage chest. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Tell Dorian she can call upon us at any time. "
3327,Frame Work,Meet Dorian Atwater at the Algerson Lumber Yard in Tiragarde Sound. ,"Now that I have a slip to work in, I'm going to need lumber.

Lots of lumber.

The only lumber mill that could handle this kind of volume at such short notice would be the Algerson Lumber Yard outside of Boralus.

I know this because I've made this exact request of them before.

I will meet you there. Algerson might need a little persuasion. "
3328,The Deep Ones,Slay 12 drowned forces in Port Fogtide. ,"I've spent my whole life on and around the sea. 

Until very recently I feel like I've always had one foot in the water. I knew there were. . . things. . . best left untouched.

Now they're here. In Stormsong Valley. Occupying the slip I need to build your ship.

Do I really need to tell you what to do about it? "
3329,Stranger in a Strange Land,Find Chromie in Stormwind City. ,"Welcome to Stormwind, <race>. King Anduin Wrynn invites you to explore our fair city. Since you hail from Kul Tiras, might I suggest visiting our lovely docks? They are home to our majestic fleet. I would be shocked if you were not impressed!

Ah, but that can wait, a bronze dragon has asked to talk to you. She is sitting under the nearby tree, on an hourglass of all things!

After that, an emissary of Kul Tiras is waiting to welcome you to the city. Sounds like a busy day for you!

Have a pleasant stay, "
3330,Heritage of the Lightforged,Meet Captain Fareeya aboard the Vindicaar. ,"Your service to the Alliance has been most impressive, $p. I could not have done better myself. Well, I could. . . but not by much.

Come, meet with me at the Vindicaar. It is time that we reward your diligence. "
3331,Forge of Aeons,Bear witness to the ritual of the Lightforged. ,"The Lightforged have long stood as a beacon of hope against the Legion.

But few truly know what it takes to become the embodiment of Light's wrath.

These few champions among the Army of the Light are ready to undergo their final trial.

Will you do us the honor of bearing witness? "
3332,For the Light! ,Return to Stormwind and speak with Aysa Cloudsinger to hear the end of his tale. ,"The Lightforged Draenei will be happy to join the Alliance.

Our cause is now yours, <name>.

Let us return to Stormwind. Captain Fareeya will speak with our people. "
3333,The Lightforged,Travel to the Vindicaar. ,"Do you wish to hear how the Lightforged draenei joined the Alliance? It might be one of my favorite stories.

Most likely since it involves seeing our beautiful world from space!

It all began when High Exarch Turalyon invited members of the Alliance onto the Vindicaar. . . "
3334,For the Alliance,Meet Ambassador Moorgard at the Stormwind Embassy. ,"The Army of the Light was founded with one purpose: to defeat the Legion. Though we have achieved that goal, a new duty lies before us.

Azeroth is a world beset by enemies. Use your training to battle the darkness and uphold the ideals of the Alliance.

Go to Stormwind. Seek the king's ambassador at the embassy, then set out to spread the Light's justice across the land.

Pheta thones gamera, <name>. "
3335,Stranger in a Strange Land,Find Chromie in Stormwind City. ,"Welcome to Stormwind, <race>. King Anduin Wrynn invites you to explore our fair city. Say, you look like the devout sort. We have a lovely cathedral that will no doubt be of interest! 

Ah, but that can wait, a bronze dragon has asked to talk to you. She is sitting under the nearby tree, on an hourglass of all things!

After that, an emissary of the Lightforged is waiting to welcome you to the city. Sounds like a busy day for you!

Have a pleasant stay, <name>! "
3336,Vision of Time,Meet with Chief Telemancer Oculeth in Zuldazar. ,"You wish to hear how the Mag'har orcs joined the Horde? It may be one of the strangest ways we gained an ally!

It all began with a plan from Eitrigg. He had a fragment of the Vision of Time that Garrosh Hellscream used to travel to Draenor. Chief Telemancer Oculeth believed there would be a way to go back to Draenor and get the Mag'har orcs to join the Horde.

This tale begins with a visit to Oculeth in Zuldazar. . . "
3337,Echo of Garrosh Hellscream,"Meet Anachronos outside the gates of Orgrimmar, then defeat the Echo of Garrosh within the Siege of Orgrimmar. ","Our final destination will take us to the depths beneath your city of Orgrimmar.

The way there is barred, but I can get us inside.

Meet me outside the gates of Orgrimmar and we will descend together. "
3338,Restoring Old Bonds,Speak with Oculeth to travel to Draenor and meet with the Mag'har. ,"We must speak to Grommash Hellscream and remind him of his debt to us. Everything rests on this mission, <name>.

I hope your skills in diplomacy are greater than mine.

Be on your guard; we do not know what to expect on the other side. "
3339,Echo of Gul'dan,Defeat the Echo of Gul'dan at the Dark Portal in Blasted Lands. ,"To attune this shard to the place you wish to go, we must follow some of its history.

The first location we will visit is the Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands.

It was there that Gul'dan used a piece of the Vision of Time to travel between realities.

Join me there when you are ready. "
3340,Heritage of the Mag'har,Meet Overlord Geya'rah in Orgrimmar. ,"You have fought countless battles across the face of Azeroth. You have shown both our allies and enemies what it means to be Mag'har!

Return to Orgrimmar that I may recognize your dedication to our people. "
3341,Caverns of Time,Meet with Anachronos in the Caverns of Time. ,"Were the shard of the Vision of Time not depleted, I could use it to send you on your way. But my specialty is teleportation, not chronomancy.

Time magic was the province of our former leader, Grand Magistrix Elisande. Much of her knowledge died with her.

It is said Elisande had mastered incantations known only to the bronze dragons. Perhaps they would be willing to aid your cause. "
3342,Tyranny of the Light,Assist Geya'rah against the Tyranny of the Light. ,"If it is not an uprising of ogres or the promise of starvation, it's the constant threat of the Lightbound.

Should the reports prove true, this is the closest they have dared approach our stronghold in quite some time.

Come or stay, but make your decision quickly. "
3343,Bonds Forged Through Battle,Assist Geya'rah in putting down the ogre uprising. ,"Geya'rah has a fiery spirit. . . like her mother. Perhaps facing a common foe will ease her wariness.

We subdued the ogre clans long ago. But every so often, one of their bravest--and stupidest--stirs the embers of rebellion. Today is such a day.

You and Eitrigg will join Geya'rah in putting down the ogre uprising. Prove yourself in battle and you may earn her respect. "
3344,Echo of Warlord Zaela,Defeat the Echo of Warlord Zaela at the Temple of the White Tiger in Kun Lai Summit. ,"Warlord Zaela. . . another name that stains the tongue just to speak it. . .

She was instrumental in freeing Garrosh during his trial when she and her Dragonmaw clan attacked the Temple of the White Tiger.

I am ashamed to say that the dragon Kairozdormu was also involved. We will speak of this no more.

The temple in Kun Lai Summit is our next destination. "
3345,Calling Out the Clans,Pay homage to the orc clan symbols. ,"This Overlord Geya'rah has a fire inside her. I may come to like her. . . if she doesn't kill us.

We have but one chance. You pay homage to the symbol of each clan, and I will speak of it.

Show respect--or they will show us the executioner's blade. "
3346,The Uncorrupted,Return to Ji Firepaw in Orgrimmar to hear the end of this tale. ,"This world is. . . not what I expected.

It is time for us to meet your warchief, <name>.

<Blackguard looks down at a piece of paper in his hand. >

On behalf of the warchief, I am honored to welcome you to Orgrimmar, <race>.

<Glances at you, smiles unconvincingly, then looks back at the paper. >

As a lifetime of adventure unfolds before you, be assured that. . . uh. . .

You know what? I've been reading this same greeting all day. Enough's enough.

Talk to Chromie, she's on the hourglass, then talk to your emissary. Run along. "
3348,A Veteran's Summons,Meet Eitrigg at the Orgrimmar Embassy. ,"<name>, we received word from Orgrimmar. Eitrigg has requested a meeting. Says it's important. He left a letter for you.

I wouldn't keep him waiting or he might expire of old age before you find out what he wants. "
3349,For the Horde,Meet Ambassador Blackguard at the Orgrimmar Embassy. ,"The Mag'har face a new future, <class>.

Draenor has fallen. We cannot know if we will ever set eyes upon our homeland again. But this is not the time to wallow in past sorrows.

Destiny is ours to decide. Orgrimmar is our home now, and we must make our mark upon this land!

Show our allies in the Horde what it means to be Mag'har. Meet with the ambassador at the warchief's embassy, then go forth and claim victories across Azeroth.

Strength and honor, <name>! "
3350,Urgent Care,Find Kelsey Steelspark in Boralus Harbor. ,"Excellent timing, <name>. Kelsey Steelspark has been sending communications to the capital cities looking for aid.

Hurry to Boralus Harbor, she will be watching for you. "
3351,A Strong Heart,Retrieve the Spark Reactor and complete Mekkatorque's procedure. ,"We saw a flare near Junkwatt Depot. 

The retrieval team has made it out with the power source. We are now forever safe from King Mechagon's Annihilo-tron, its heart will serve a new purpose.

This is great news!

However, the flare means they have company. Your help will be needed to extricate the team and retrieve the Spark Reactor.

Please move with haste, we are so close to completion. "
3352,Voyage to Safety,Defeat the scavenging troggs and retrieve Mekkatorque's Escape Pod. ,"One of our defenders saw the troggs take out the homing copter carrying Mekkatorque's pod. 

Since we started bringing goods in from Tiragarde, they have been a real thorn in our side. 

Piston, a very promising young inventor, has a vehicle able to handle this task. Meet his crew down in Bondo's yard.

Please hurry and retrieve the pod! I am not sure what will happen to Gelbin, if they break it open.

Ahem, we would not be upset if you did a little beach clean-up while you were there. . . "
3353,Heritage of the Mechagnome,Meet Prince Erazmin in Mechagon City. ,"<name>, we could not be more pleased with your progress. You represent us well with the Alliance.

Return to Mechagon City at your earliest convenience. Waren has created a gift for you. "
3354,Waning Energy,Meet Kelsey Steelspark at Proudmoore Keep. ,"Mekkatorque's pod is powering down. 

We are no longer able to hear him speak. 

His pulse has slowed, in spite of the best efforts of Kul Tiran healers.

I have an idea, but I am going to need your help.

Meet me at Proudmoore Keep. We must go soon. "
3355,Someone Who Can Help,Help Kelsey move Mekkatorque's Escape Pod to Mechagon. ,"I believe there is a way to help Mekkatorque, but some may not be a hundred percent on board. . . 

The mechagnomes have advanced techniques in biomechanical repair and improvements.

If there is even a chance they can help him, we have to try! There are some mechagnomes sending supplies out to the island from a dock in Hook Point. No one will notice one more piece of cargo. We need to reroute one of their homing copters.

Will you please help me get Mekkatorque's Pod to Mechagon? "
3356,The Current Schematic,Collect 4 Heat Tolerant Ooze and 6 Acquisitioned Machine Parts. ,"I think I can modify one of our existing devices to give us access to Gelbin Mekkatorque without disturbing his life preserving functions.

There are some items I will need you to procure. 

From the nearby vector of the Heaps, you will find scrapbots and scraphounds. These would be a fine source of spare parts for my construction project.

The Outflow is home to some particularly slimy friends. From them, you will find excellent ingredients for the heat resistant lubricant we need. "
3357,Ascension,Clear the remaining Mechagon defenders. ,"After everything the mechagnomes have done for us today, it is our duty to return the favor.

Let us clear out the rogue creations that remain in Mechagon. 

With their home returned, Prince Erazmin and his people will have a brilliant path forward.

With this team, we will make short work of the remaining King Mechagon loyalists.

Let me know when you are ready to roll out! "
3358,Better. . . Stronger. . . Less Dead,"Collect the Neural Accelerator, Omni Electromagnetic Amplifier, and Flux Energized Servos from the erratic units. ","King Mechagon may have been crazy, but his minions did have exemplary robotic creation capabilities. 

There are a few residual creations wandering Mechagon. Refusing to accept King Mechagon's dethroning.

The logical conclusion to defeat is withdrawal, if one remains operational. Some do not excel at logic.

They currently bear the latest in technical advancement. I believe retrieving specific pieces from these units would greatly benefit our recovery endeavor. "
3359,Propagate the News,Update Aysa Cloudsinger in Stormwind. ,"We wanted to save a life and we have accomplished so much more!

We really couldn't have done it without you, <name>. I am so excited about the future of all gnomekind.

Your assistance is needed to get him stabilized and synchronized before removing him from his pod.

Please position yourself by the Synchroscope. I will make adjustments, you will need to fire the machine when I call. "
3361,Him? ,Gather data from gnomes and mechagnomes in Mechagon. ,"Speak to some of the gnomes in Mechagon, enhanced or otherwise. Of my people, ask what they hope for in a leader of our kind. Of our new friends, ask what they appreciate most about their current leader.

From what I have learned thus far, the High Tinker has always led his people by necessity, he never sought or desired the crown. I believe the gnomes should be united once again. 

I seek a solution that will be most amenable to all. Will you gather the information I need? "
3362,The Future of Mechagon,Travel to the High Tinkertory in Mechagon City. ,"Now that Mechagon City has been cleared of its remaining dangers, it may once again be a place of peace and prosperity for gnomes and mechagnomes alike.

3366,Thalyssra's Estate,Meet with Lady Liadrin at the Estate of the First Arcanist in Suramar. ,"Would you like to hear how the nightborne came to join the Horde?

We earned their trust when we aided them in liberating Suramar from the tyranny of Grand Magistrix Elisande and the Burning Legion.

3373,The Ghostlands,Locate Umbric's home in the Ghostlands. ,"Are you familiar with how the Void elves joined the Alliance? 

It began with Alleria Windrunner finding out about a blood elf named Umbric. 

He and his followers were banished from Silvermoon City for researching void magic.

Alleria believed she could convince Umbric and his followers to join the Alliance and prevent the void from corrupting them.

It all began when she opened up a portal to go into the Ghostlands. . . "
3374,Telogrus Rift,Travel to Telogrus Rift and complete the scenario. ,"Umbric and his blood elves were cast out of their home for their pursuit of understanding.

I know the dangers of the void better than most. We should lend them our aid and ensure they don't do anything too foolhardy.

Part of me still can't accept it.

Prince Kael'thas led my people down a dark path. I have to believe the majority of sin'dorei would shrug off the Horde if given the choice.

The last time I spoke to Lor'themar, we served together in the Farstriders. He was a fine ranger and a good man. I pray the years have not changed that.

Come. We must not keep the regent waiting. See if you've already completed this by typing: /run print(C_QuestLog. IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(48489))"
3378,The Pledge,Return to Stormwind and speak with Anduin. ,"The ethereals were lying in wait, anticipating someone strong enough in the void to be corrupted by the influence of the Old Gods.

However, I believe we dealt with the Zandalari of the past. The now Queen Talanji is much different from her father.

I'm rambling, my apologies. Our tale begins after the Alliance sacked the city of Zuldazar and killed King Rastakhan.

The Horde had been invited by the then Princess Talanji to witness her coronation in Zuldazar. . . "
3383,Heritage of the Zandalari,Meet Queen Talanji at the Golden Throne in Zuldazar City. ,"You have faced many challenges in your time among de Horde. You carried de pride of de Zandalari on your shoulders and triumphed!

Now go, and Pa'ku's winds make you swift. "
3385,Allegiance of the Zandalari,Bring the Zandalari into the Horde. ,"It is decided, <name>.

De Zandalari will join de Horde.

Our path together has been a long and difficult one. We have lost much together. De Horde has sacrificed for de Zandalari, and vice versa. I can do nothing to honor that commitment except pledge our loyalty.

Collect your Warchief and send them to my throne. I will extend de offer myself. "
3386,The Rite of Kings and Queens,Ride in procession with Princess Talanji. ,"Now that you are here, we can begin this sacred rite.

3388,Gaze of the Loa,Follow Talanji. ,"My council has given their blessing and we have dealt with an enemy. All that remains is to face de judgment of my loa.

There is much I have to atone for, but I am not yet ruler. I have not had de time to do what is needed for de faithful of Zandalar. That does not mean they deserve to suffer.

Go into de Terrace of de Chosen and find them that refuse to fight. See that they get out safely. I will hold none of them accountable for de actions of others. "

It is time to accept de responsibility of leadership. I will address them and speak on our future. I would be honored if you would take a place at my side while I do so. "
3391,The Instigator Among Us,Confront Enforcer Malzon in the Zocalo. ,"This situation can be swiftly dealt with if we take out de one that incited this violence.

I heard reports of an enforcer rousing de vagrants and drudges against de shopkeepers and guards in de Zocalo.

 I will not tolerate it! 

<She gestures to the prelate before her with her spear. >

This one has wisely told me who is to blame. My second, Kaj'ra.

I would have heard her, had she used any other means to make her concerns known. Now she must be disposed of.

You will find her in de Terrace of de Chosen. "
3394,Gaze of the Loa: Gonk,Complete Gonk's trial. ,"The Lord of the Pack has requested to be the next to speak to Talanji. He is just up the steps on the next terrace.

Do not think we are not aware of your intentions, <name>. "
3395,Gaze of the Loa: Krag'wa,"""Witness"" Krag'wa's trial. ","Hello again, small one.

I see Talanji has chosen a worthy witness. I must test Talanji's willingness to sacrifice for her people. I will weigh her commitment to defending the weak. Many great rulers have failed this challenge and still gone on to make powerful monarchs.

But the most beloved, those that find themselves surrounded by loyal followers, always understand the value of devotion to their people.

You will help me with this trial. Speak to me when you are ready to begin. "

I care only for de result: Peace, so Talanji can finally be crowned. "
3398,The New Zanchuli Council,Greet the Zanchuli Council. ,"These are sobering developments <name>.

Princess Talanji wishes for us to spare them that will see reason. Do so, if you can find any willing to surrender.

For de rest, give them a swift death. "
3400,Gaze of the Loa: Pa'ku,Complete Pa'ku's trial. ,"Two more loa have declared their intent to test Talanji. The next is Pa'ku. She awaits you both at the top of these steps.

3404,Escape from Durnholde,"When you are ready to proceed, let Thrall know. ","I have plans for my people, stranger. One day, they shall overthrow their oppressors and rise as one.

3405,Grime-Encrusted Ring,Figure out a way to remove the grime from the Grime-Encrusted Ring. ,"You have uncovered what appears to be a ring from the corpse of one of the Dark Iron dwarves.  It is difficult to tell what kind of ring it is, however; dirt and hardened residue cake the item completely, making wearing it impossible.  You think you can make out the slight luster of precious metal and maybe even the glint of a gem under the residue. If you are going to make use of this ring, you are going to need to find something to get the hardened residue off of it. "
3406,Rewind and Reconcile,Give the Time Relic to Nozdormu at Temporal Conflux in Thaldraszus. ,<You sense powerful time energy emanating from the relic you retrieved after your fight with Chrono-Lord Deios.

3409,Nice Hat. . . ,Don Carlos has inadvertently challenged you to defeat his younger self in Old Hillsbrad. ,"My hat? Yes, it's an unusual style, I know, from far away. . . few tailors here know how to make them. When I was young and hot-blooded, I wore it as a standing challenge. Many came seeking to defeat me and win it for themselves. . . but no one ever did. Ah, but those days are long past. I'm an old man, now: I drink, I fish, but I no longer duel. "
3410,The Seat of the Triumvirate: Armor of the Triumvirate,Secure the Armor of the Light and bring it to Archivist Ionaa. ,"This reforged key will grant entry into the armory inside the Seat of the Triumvirate.

Locked away inside is the Armor of the Triumvirate, crafted in the days before Sargeras brought ruin to our world. We cannot let this armor be stolen by the Void's forces.

I've never seen so many Chromies in one place! And while they all may be cute, they're playing havoc on the local timeways.

We need to trap them to synchronize their time signatures. Maybe then they'll be able to tell us what's going on! "
3415,Annals of the Silver Hand,Recover a lost volume of the Annals of the Silver Hand from Stratholme. ,"Do you know who the Knights of the Silver Hand were? They were the original paladins of the Light, and from their ranks came knights who would later join the Argent Dawn or the Scarlet Crusade. Though many have gone astray, they still possess valuable relics of the Silver Hand. Deep in Stratholme, under the watchful eye of Instructor Galford, volumes of the Annals of the Silver Hand survive. Any volumes you could recover would be a fitting addition to the rededicated Light's Hope Chapel. "
3416,Fragments of the Past,"Collect the Soul Fragments from the Guest Chambers, Banquet Hall, Servant Quarters, Opera Hall and the Menagerie inside Karazhan. ","Though your primary objective is to liberate the tower from the Legion's hold, I have. . . another request. Karazhan is a place where magic and history intertwine. Moments of the past have been known to take physical form, and these forms can possess great power. As you journey through Karazhan, watch for places where memories coalesce. These fragments could provide valuable insight into what's really going on inside that tower. "

I studied the writings of Aegwynn, the Guardian who defeated the Dark Titan's avatar. She said that if her wards were compromised, a failsafe could be triggered by placing the Aegis of Aggramar upon an altar in the Cathedral of Eternal Night.

3418,The End Time,Speak with Nozdormu at the End Time. ,"Nozdormu, the bronze Aspect, has asked for help from the champions of the Alliance. You are on his short list. I can share few other details.

3419,Who's That Chromie? ,Capture Morchie and question her. ,"Morchie didn't just teleport herself away, she took all the other Chromies with her! I have a bad feeling about why. . .

3420,On a Wing and a Prayer,Bring the Timeless Eye to Coldarra. ,"Time well spent, mortal. While you struggled in the Plane of Fire, my watchers and I were able to determine when and, most importantly, where our vision was obscured.

3423,Align in the Sand,Place the Temporal Hourglasses throughout the Shifting Sands in Thaldraszus. ,"So, the timeways, yeah? They're VERY misaligned. And you know how we bronzes hate that! So we need to realign time with these temporal hourglasses. Just plop them down throughout Eon's Fringe.

3424,Cold Steel,Find an Iron Autocannon in Grimrail Depot. ,"Do you know what I want? What everyone who came through that portal wants. Every soldier running from a world that didn't understand us, didn't need us. I want that world to love us as much as we love it. But we don't really belong there, not anymore. War is part of us, and we can't go back. To everyone back there, we're expendable. The only thing that makes me feel better now is the feel of a cold iron cannon in my hands, pointed at the enemy. <Keeshan stares into his mug of ale. >"
3425,The Scarlet Key,"&lt; Though dirt and rust have accumulated on these keys, the one you currently possess looks no different otherwise.

3432,Fel Ember,Stone Guard Stok'ton inside the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel wants you to bring him a Fel Ember. ,"Caza'rez is dying a coward's death.

Their influence has sunk too deeply. "
3440,The Path to the Dragon Soul,Slay Mannoroth. ,"I cannot simply fly up and grab the Dragon Soul. The old gods protect it. To make matters worse, their shield is strengthened by the swirling, arcane energies that emanate from the Well of Eternity, and those energies are being focused by the great demon Mannoroth.

The commander remembers the acidic solution, yes? Quite effective it was, though one barrel was not enough to remove ALL of the blood stains from the portraits, or the tapestries, or the ceiling.

It's a problem finding a delivery person willing to set foot inside. . . mortality rates being what they are. If you would, grab the crate and take it to Koren in the stables. Just be careful passing Attumen. The huntsman doesn't take kindly to outsiders. "
3822,Return to Karazhan: Rebooting the Cleaner,Disable the Curator and find the Box of Spare Motivator Crystals. ,"The Guardian Medivh created the Curator to watch over Karazhan, but I fear the unit is behaving erratically. Prolonged periods of operation may have caused a malfunction. Please go up to the Menagerie and disable the Curator. Also, search the area for a box of spare motivator crystals and return to me. Even with my basic knowledge I should be able to replace its motivator, and we can enlist the Curator 's help in cleaning up the tower. "
3823,Return to Karazhan: The Tower of Power,Defeat Viz'aduum the Watcher in Karazhan. ,"Your champions discovered that the area surrounding Karazhan is under an invasion from the Legion. This does not bode well.

I've tried to get close to him before, but it's never quite worked out. You might have better luck. Just watch out -- I hear that he's gone well and truly insane.

3832,Brother Against Brother,Free Lakka from captivity. ,"The Sethekk departed Skettis when Auchindoun exploded. My brother, Syth, was one of their leaders and told us we had to go into the ruins and face our god. In time, Syth had me cast out of the Halls for doubting them, but he refused to let me take our sister Lakka. Will you help me rescue her? "
3833,Can't Stay Away,"Speak with Isfar, who can be found just inside the Sethekk Halls in Auchindoun. ","I tried to persuade Isfar to remain here, in the safety of Shattrath, but he would have none of it. Instead, he's decided to venture out to Auchindoun again on his own. He was lucky enough to escape the Sethekk Halls once, but if they discover him, there won't be a second time. I admire his desire to free his sister, but he's not going to be able to do it without help. Find Isfar and have a word with him, <name>. If you can't persuade him to come back, perhaps you could help him rescue Lakka? "
3834,Eyes of Desire,Dealer Vijad inside the Sethekk Halls wants you to bring him 3 Cobalt Eyes. ,"I have a buyer who is interested in the eyes of the Cobalt Serpents that have taken up residence here. If you were to bring me some of these rare gems, I would cut you a portion of the profits. Do we have a deal? "

They fed the others to Hellmaw, and I was to be next. But I told them nothing! They're using special devices to make their summoning more powerful. You must steal these devices! "
3843,Trouble at Auchindoun,Report to Field Commander Mahfuun inside the Shadow Labyrinth at Auchindoun in Terokkar Forest. ,"I have spies within Auchindoun and they have been sending me disturbing reports.  That place has been nothing but trouble ever since it exploded a couple of years ago. Something in there has gone horribly wrong - again - and the Shadow Council is now on a war footing.  Though the reports were lacking on details, their preparations appear to be directed inward. You must make your way to the Shadow Labyrinth.  My field commander, Mahfuun, will fill you in on what needs to be done. "
3844,Find Spy To'gun,Locate Spy To'gun in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun. ,"The Shadow Council has already killed most of our spies, but To'gun was foolish enough to escape only to go back in! You must find him. He may be reckless, but we need to find out what he knows. "

3846,Ambassador Hellmaw,"Kill 12 Cabal Ritualists and Ambassador Hellmaw, then return to Field Commander Mahfuun inside the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun. ","When the Cabal found our spies, they fed them to Ambassador Hellmaw one by one. Our men deserve justice. Slay the ritualists binding him, then dispose of Hellmaw. It is a most deserving fate. "
3847,WANTED: Malicious Instructors,Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to kill 3 Malicious Instructors. ,"Mah'duun has heard it said that none are as cruel as the six-armed demonesses inside the Shadow Labyrinth. Go to Auchindoun, seek them out, kill them all. If you cannot accomplish so simple a task, we do not have anything further to say to one another. "
3848,This Land is Our Land,Kill Baron Ashbury. ,"Did you think that a handful of worgen vermin could stop me? Hah! Shadowfang Keep was part of the Lordaeron kingdom in life, so it is quite fitting that it should belong to the Forsaken in death. Godfrey and his accomplices are minor obstacles at best, and of course we're all happy to take them out for their treachery against the Dark Lady. Ashbury has positioned himself near the front of the keep, leaving him wide open to attack. Start us out on the right foot, would you? "
3849,Fury of the Pack,Kill Lord Godfrey. ,"Ah, the sweet scent of victory! My men should be tearing Godfrey to pieces even as we speak. Go up to his domain and collect your share of the spoils - you've earned it! You'd think that he would have been more difficult to defeat. . . "
3850,Orders Are For the Living,Kill Lord Walden. ,"Unsurprisingly, we aren't going to listen to Cromush about the plague. However, his brute strength will come in handy for muscling my men through the many foes ahead on the path to Godfrey, the most powerful being his right hand man, Lord Walden. I'll meet you in Walden's chamber after you finish him off. Then, at long last, we can completely take Shadowfang Keep for the Forsaken! "
3851,Plague. . . Plague Everywhere! ,Kill Baron Silverlaine and Commander Springvale. ,"The best part about this plague is that even when it visually fades away, the remaining residue is still quite potent! However, we still have an enormous area to cover before we're done, with plenty of Godfrey's defenses in the way. It appears that the spirits that served Baron Silverlaine and Commander Springvale in life now guard them in death, and Godfrey is using them to deter us. Show them all the iron will of the Forsaken! "
3852,Sniffing Them Out,Kill Baron Ashbury. ,"I could smell Godfrey and his companions a mile away from here. They did an exceedingly poor job covering their tracks in flight. It will be the mistake that puts the final nail in their coffins. One of them is very close, and though the scent has changed slightly in undeath, I'm fairly certain it's Ashbury's. Go inside and tear him to pieces, we'll ensure the Forsaken do not intervene with our task. "
3853,Armored to the Teeth,Kill Baron Silverlaine and Commander Springvale. ,"We've hit an unexpected snag in our assault on the keep, <name>. It seems the servants that tended to Baron Silverlaine and Commander Springvale in life do so now in death as well, and Godfrey has placed them directly between us and him. Not to worry, we won't let them be anything more than a minor inconvenience. Eliminate Silverlaine and Springvale both and not only will their guards no longer have masters to direct them, it will place us that much closer to our final goal. "
3854,Fighting Tooth and Claw,Kill Lord Walden. ,"It appears that Lord Walden has finally taken notice to our presence and has heightened his defenses. It's worthless really. . . nothing will deter our pack. The path ahead to him is rife with powerful Scourge minions, but I trust that you will be able to clear the path for the rest of us to follow in. Once we kill Walden, it should be a straight shot to his cowardly leader. "
3855,Shadowy Secrets,Collect a Dark Parchment from the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds. ,"Though the Lich King has been defeated, we are no closer to unlocking the secrets of the Frozen Throne than we were when jousting pointlessly at the Argent Tournament. Bolvar remains resigned to his fate. Perhaps there is something here, though, that can aid us. Ner'zhul was not always the Lich King, you know. Once, he was a mere orc dabbling in dark powers beyond his comprehension. Find whatever you can of his early studies, and we may have our answers. "
3856,The Huntresses,Collect a Silver-Lined Arrow from the Shadowmoon Burial Ground. ,"I do not wish to come out of the shadows, but I mean you no harm. My purpose here is my own secret to keep, I simply needed a warm place to bed down for the night. I can see that you are not the type to be easily swayed into leaving. Very well, perhaps you can aid me in my search. I am looking for someone, it is not important who. All you need to know is that I will reward you for any sign of high elven weaponry that you should come across. "
3857,The Void-Gate,Find a Void-Gate Key in the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds. ,"My 'master' is an idiot, but you look like you've got some smarts in that oddly-shaped head. Listen up, the Twisting Nether is a chaotic abyss, and things work differently there. I've felt some disturbances, and they don't bode well for any of us. Yes, there are things happening here, in Draenor, that are causing ripples in the nether. No, don't try to wrap your head around how that works, you'll only hurt yourself. It's simple: bring me a Void-Gate Key, and maybe I can stop the bad things. "
3858,Shadowmoon Burial Grounds,Defeat Ner'zhul in the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds. ,"Ner'zhul was once a noble orc - he was the wise chieftain and elder shaman of the Shadowmoon clan. In his desperate bid to join the Iron Horde he has spat on all he once stood for and twisted his ancestors' spirits to tap into dark, forbidden power. . . all to please Hellscream. The Shadowmoon has fallen, commander. Enter their ancestral burial grounds and put an end to Ner'zhul 's madness before he pulls all of Draenor into the engulfing maw of the void. "
3859,Whispers in the Darkness,Find a Void-Gate Key in the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds. ,"If you don't mind, I'm trying VERY hard to prevent all of our worlds from collapsing into the void, AGAIN. Oh, right, you helped me last time, didn't you? Well, you've got great timing. I'm in need of another Gate-Key. Well? Go on! The infinite horrors of the abyss aren't just going to wait until you've had a nap! Having that many tentacles makes them really antsy. "
3860,Fate of the Fallen,Collect a Silver-Lined Arrow from the Shadowmoon Burial Ground. ,"I feel that I can trust you, perhaps. You have, at least, not spoken of my secret to anyone, and for that I thank you. I have need of your aid again, and in return, I will share some of my own information. I am here, you see, to find an elf by the name of Alleria. She was lost years ago, on Draenor. It is my faint hope that the twisting nether brought her here. I do not know if such a thing is even possible, but do keep an eye out for any signs of high elves as you travel. "
3861,Secrets of Soulbinding,Collect a Dark Parchment from the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds. ,"We have reviewed Ner'zhul 's notes, which you brought to us previously. Though we are closer to understanding how these warlocks have learned to bind souls and control the undead, the picture is incomplete. We will need more pages if we are to see the whole picture. I do not want to experiment with partial information and create an abomination. There are enough of those in Northrend as it is. "
3862,Shadowmoon Burial Grounds,Defeat Ner'zhul in the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds. ,"Ner'zhul wasn't always evil - once he was the wise chieftain and elder shaman o' the Shadowmoon clan. In his desperate bid to join the Iron Horde he's forsaken all he once stood for and twisted his ancestors' spirits to tap into dark, forbidden power. . . all to please Hellscream. Enter their ancestral burial grounds and put an end to Ner'zhul 's madness before he pulls all o' Draenor into the engulfing maw o' the void. "

3873,Somewhere Inside,Rescue 12 Shado-Pan Prisoners. ,"I sent a dozen of my best men ahead to infiltrate the mantid siege. None have returned. Since you are taking the fight directly to the mantid, you will be in a position to free any who had the misfortune to be captured. You will do this? "

3877,Sky Dancers,Collect a Bottled Windstorm from Skyreach. ,"Greetings, <name>, and I thank you for your hospitality. The Shado-pan have sent several warriors to aid against the Iron Horde, however we can. We are few, though, and they are many. The arakkoa in the south are both beautiful and deadly. They appear lighter than air, their attacks a deadly dance that flits from opponent to opponent. The winds are on their side, as the four winds lighten the steps of my own allies. Bring me a sample of their winds, if you are able. It will surely aid us. "
3878,Aviana's Request,Collect some Pristine Plumage in Skyreach. ,"The arakkoa are creatures of the sky, and are thus within the domain of the great Aviana. I have been sent to procure a feather, that we may parley with them through the language of the winds. We will extend an invitation of peace, and a place on the Great Bough. Would you aid us in this quest? The feather must come from an arakkoan of nobility. You will find them in the place known as Skyreach. "
3879,Gloriously Incandescent,Collect a Sun Crystal in Skyreach. ,"I did not come here to fight, I have seen too many die already. I have killed so many with my own hands. I have come to seek the light, and redemption. The arakkoa of this land worship the sun as I do. But they are a violent, isolationist, and decadent race, who seem to derive a different message than my own people. This troubles me. Bring me one of their Sun Crystals. I wish to see this light. "
3880,A Plea to the Sky,Collect some Pristine Plumage in Skyreach. ,"We have, so far, been unsuccessful in our attempts to contact the arakkoa. Each attempt strips the plumage, and we are left with a feather that is tattered and broken. Aviana implores you, commander, to find another plume for her. We do not wish to see our brethren become victim of their own violent nature. All beings of the sky have a place with us, in life or beyond. "
3881,Skyreach,Defeat High Sage Viryx in Skyreach. ,High Sage Viryx has finished a devastatin' crystal superweapon atop the highest point in Skyreach in Spires of Arak.

3883,The Dark Within,Collect a Sun Crystal in Skyreach. ,"The light. . . has gone out. I know not why. I am more troubled now than before. I can find little comfort in the everyday.

3890,The Great Ezra Grimm,Recover a box of Ezra Grimm's Premium Tobacco. ,"Men as far as Kul Tiras spoke of the legendary Ezra Grimm's premium tobacco. It was a delicacy enjoyed by every single person of importance that visited Stratholme. King Terenas, Uther the Lightbringer, Highlord Fordring. . . yes, they all enjoyed Grimm's specialty. Sadly, Ezra stayed in his shop when Stratholme was invaded, swearing on his life that the Scourge would never touch his tobacco. Venture forth and see if even one bit remains here. . . it is worth its weight in gold, I assure you. "
3891,Liquid Gold,Find a vial of Stratholme Holy Water. ,"As the Scourge swept through Stratholme like a plague, the Knights of the Silver Hand manufactured holy water to use against the invaders. They stored it inside small crates along with other vital supplies, and distributed them throughout the city. Unfortunately, the citizens turned into Scourge reinforcements before the supplies could ever be used! These supply crates will prove extremely useful to our efforts. Bring me a vial of Stratholme Holy Water, we need to have it replicated in mass quantities. "
3892,Of Love and Family,Find 'Of Love and Family. ,"Inside the Scarlet Bastion is a painting of great personal value to Highlord Tirion Fordring. Search for a painting of our twin moons. Chip away at the paint until you uncover the master work, ' Of Love and Family. 'May the Light guide your actions, and please handle the painting with the utmost care. "
3893,A City Under Siege,Speak to Packmaster Stonebruiser. ,"We will never control the Eastern Plaguelands if we do not control Stratholme. Not only is it a point of incredible strategic importance, it also houses our enemies' leaders - Balnazzar and Lord Aurius Rivendare. Their Risen and Scourge armies threaten to erase all the progress we've made. The Argent Crusade is well-suited to this task. Travel west through Stratholme 's main gate and speak with Packmaster Stonebruiser. He will direct you further. "
3894,Weapons for War,Kill the Black Guard Swordsmith. ,"The Scourge are adept at forging powerful armaments for their soldiers, making it difficult for our men to kill 'em! There are blacksmithing plans near the Baroness Anastari's ziggurat that their chief swordsmith plans to use for an extremely powerful weapon for Lord Aurius. We're going to prevent that weapon from being made and stop their regular arms flow with one blow! Go take the plans and kill the Black Guard Swordsmith when he comes to defend 'em, and it'll make our mission much easier. "
3895,Lord Aurius Rivendare,Kill Lord Aurius Rivendare. ,"This Chapel is the last Light amongst so much darkness. Ras Frostwhisper took his own life in the slaughterhouse, carving his face into a macabre smile in front of the Lich King, who raised him into the Lich that now haunts Scholomance. The ground where that atrocity occured is now Scourge holy ground, blessed by the Lich King with the very darkest magic. Lord Aurius Rivendare, new ruler of Stratholme, now guards it and continues his master's evil work. Slay him without pause. "
3896,The Dreadlord Balnazzar,Kill Balnazzar. ,"With the fall of the Scarlet Crusade, their disguised demon leader, Balnazzar, released the possessed body of Grand Crusader Dathrohan and went on a rampage, killing every remaining crusader here. He then used his necromantic power to raise them all as vile undead slaves. Balnazzar refers to his new army as the Risen. We cannot let him grow this army - they are extremely powerful and, unlike Arthas' Scourge, Balnazzar will not hold his forces back. Kill him while we still have a chance, <class>. "
3897,Cutting the Competition,Kill the Risen Hammersmith. ,"Look, I'm not about t' play games with ye. The Scarlet Crusade's Crimson Hammersmith was nothin' worth mentionin' before, but now that they're Balnazzar's Risen, the damned dreadlord has taught him t' make all sorts of powerful demonic weaponry. It's simple. Find their blacksmithing plans and kill the Risen Hammersmith when he comes for 'em, so that we can make sure their army doesn't get their hands on demon armaments. They're powerful enough as it is! "
3898,Man Against Abomination,Slaughter Ramstein the Gorger. ,"Deep within, you will find Ramstein the Gorger. I cannot bear to tell you the atrocities this monster has commited. Know only this - he deserves to feel the full wrath of countless lost souls, a wrath you will bring upon him. Have no mercy. Be unwavering in your fury. "
3899,Argent Reinforcements,Obtain 4 Banshee Essences. ,"The Scourge have some sort of ward in place that's preventing me from opening a portal so that our reinforcements can help us take the city! It's like a neverending screaming inside of my head! Agh! I'm doing all I can to retain my sanity from that noise with this barrier. My best guess is that the banshees are maintaining the defense. If you could bring me some of their essences, I think I can use them to counteract the ward and get our boys in here! "
3900,Retribution,Kill The Unforgiven and Timmy the Cruel. ,"Where Market Row meets Festival Lane, you will encounter The Unforgiven. If you slay the entirety of Crusaders' Square, you will coax out Timmy the Cruel. Both of these former champions committed heinous acts against innocents here in the name of gaining unholy power. You must destroy both of them and rid Stratholme of their foul presence. Take caution, for they were powerful fighters in life, and their new dark powers will only have made them even more deadly. "
3901,The Blood God Hakkar,Kill the Avatar of Hakkar. ,"Hakkar. . . The mere mention of The Soulflayer's name will send many running. In the Sanctum of the Fallen God the Atal'ai have recovered a significant portion of his skeleton and seek to restore him to life. Already his children have begun to show up in the area. Place this egg in that sanctum, and it will force his summoning prematurely. <name>, do not hesitate. Strike once his avatar appears! "
3902,Jammal'an the Prophet,Obtain Jammal'an the Prophet's Head. ,"Jammal'an the Prophet, leader of the Atal'ai and Hakkari trolls, has obtained a small amount of Hakkar the Soulflayer's blood. They are injecting it into the green dragons to use their bodies to produce the massive quantities of blood necessary to summon Hakkar into our world. We cannot allow this to come to pass. Slaughter Jammal'an and his priests before they get any further in their efforts! "
3903,Eranikus,Kill Eranikus. ,"The Hakkar blood the Atal'ai have been injecting into the green dragons has had devastating effects on the dragons themselves. It appears that these dragons, former jailors of the Atal'ai, have been corrupted by its presence in their bodies and have become creatures of Nightmare. Eranikus, Ysera's primary consort and lead watcher over the temple, was infused with the largest quantities of blood and has become twisted beyond imagination. After Jammal'an is dead, find Eranikus and end him. "
3904,The Heart of the Temple,Speak with Lord Itharius again inside the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. ,"I must confess I have a more personal involvement in this affair. One of the first of the green dragons corrupted here was my brother, Eranikus. I thought Eranikus gone, lost forever to the darkest rifts of nightmare, but I have heard that his shade has emerged within the temple. I know not whether it is truly him, or an empty, mournful echo. If you wish to help me further, return to the Hall of Masks and journey through the archway into the true sanctum of the temple. I will find you there. "

3949,Only the Beginning,Kill Glubtok. ,"I miss the days when legions of powerful ogres marched by the Horde's side into battle, the pathetic Alliance cowering at their ferocity.

Take these vials, they form a gas with a terrible smell when the liquid comes in contact with the air. Smells terrible, they won't be able to resist it. Use them to drive our watchers out of hiding. "

4171,I Know The Drill! ,Help Gazlowe sabotage the Iron Stonegrinder. ,"It's a machine alright. A drill - a BIG one! Fortunately, we don't have to take apart the whole thing. They're relying on forced induction, using twin superchargers to pipe extra boost into the engine. Without that boost, the drill is useless. Get in there and open the clutch on the back of the drill. That'll draw some attention away from the turbines. I'll take care of the turbines - you just worry about the hordes of bloodthirsty orcs. "

It's a nasty bit o' sorcery that their chief uses to give himself incredible magical power, but it comes at the cost of needing to feed upon souls to maintain it.

One of them is what you'd call an engineering prodigy: Solog Roark, ""The Iron Shipwright. "" This guy's good. Designed all these docks, as well as the big dreadnaughts you fought around Shattrath. If my scouts are right, he's in a prison train as we speak. . . And I betcha he'd be willing to defect! Gather up some explosives and meet Durotan next to the train to the south. "
4181,Garrison Campaign: The Fall of Shattrath,Speak to Exarch Maladaar at the Spire of Light in Talador. ,"Greetings, <name>. I bring another message from Archmage Khadgar.

Don't get me wrong, it's going to take a lot of resources, but what else are these things for?

We can plot it out on the drafting table whenever you're ready. It's going to be GLORIOUS. "
4190,Ogre Waygates,Collect 25 Ogre Waystones and use them to activate an Ogre Waygate in Draenor. ,"Six unique gates exist in Draenor, built by ogre magi in ages past.

If it can be used to blow things up, I can get it working again. We are definitely going to need some parts--some sort of ammunition wouldn't hurt either.

4206,The Ogron Live? ,Slay Groog. ,"Commander, our Frostwolf allies reportin' dat the Bladespire ogres have an outpost to our west led by an ogron. I heard tales of da ogron but never seen one.

4215,Assault on the Gorian Proving Grounds,Assault the ogre forces at the Gorian Proving Grounds in Nagrand. ,"The ogres at the Gorian Proving Grounds are rousing champions to turn against our forces in Nagrand.

4246,Your Second Inscription Work Order,"Place a work order, then collect it once it completes. ","Place another work order with my assistant. Once it is complete, we will leave it out here for you to collect. "
4247,Shadow Council Invasion! ,Repel the Shadow Council invasion of your garrison. ,"There's a cold fire in my blood, Commander. Like a warlock has my heart in his claw. Let the Shadow Council show themselves! "
4248,Shadowmoon Invasion! ,Repel the Shadowmoon clan invasion of your garrison. ,"Your arrival couldn't be more timely, commander. Shadowmoon raiders have been spotted closing in on the garrison.

I have the entire garrison on high alert. Are you ready to face them? "
4249,Assault on the Throne of Kil'jaeden,Assault the Shadow Council forces at the Throne of Kil'jaeden in Tanaan Jungle. ,"The Shadow Council are summoning their demonic masters upon a mountain they are calling the Throne of Kil'jaeden. We know the destruction the legion can cause if they are left unchecked.

Head to the Throne of Kil'jaeden and let's put an end to this invasion before it can begin. "
4250,The Clothes on Their Backs,Collect 10 Ceremonial Shadowmoon Robes. ,"Such kindness you have shown me, perhaps I can ask for one more? In our village, we salvage and reuse old cloth to patch clothes and light armor. Sadly, most of my supply was taken or destroyed in the recent attacks. The Shadowmoon cultists might think twice about stealing from us if you were to relieve them of their own resources. If you can collect some ceremonial Shadowmoon robes for me, I will demonstrate some of my favorite tailoring techniques for you. "
4251,Oru'kai's Staff,Retrieve Oru'kai's staff and return it to Delath. ,"If I had known being an enchanter was this dangerous, I would have stayed in Shattrath. 

Here, take this ring. The arakkoa told me to use the ring on the staff to nullify the enchantment.

Bring the scepter back to him and maybe he will teach you what he promised to teach me. "
4252,Black Marketeering,Speak with Zhang Yeoh in your garrison. ,"Ya did us a real solid today, <name>. Boss Goya says you're big stuff in dese parts and we should keep an eye on --- uh, I mean we should be good buds.

4253,Shocking Assistance,Collect 100 Shockscales from Shockscale eels. ,"It's been a struggle to support the family since my wife died, and I got too ambitious when I got a contract for shockscales. Alas, there is no way I will hunt enough eels to fulfill it in time now. "
4254,We Need An Army,Speak with Warmaster Zog. ,"So the new warchief decided to send you Warmaster Zog to handle local operations. Zog! I heard that guy was notorious for organizing the Alliance AND the Horde to face off against the silithid at the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj. He was a general back then. Anyway, if you go let him know about the barracks being done I'm sure he'll have some thoughts on how to put it to good use. You can find Zog up at the town hall. "
4255,Death to Amethon! ,Retrieve a Humming Draenite Spike from Amethon above Kuuro's Claim in Talador. ,"Foreman Grobash in da Talador outpost figures he knows why der's been so much seismic activity recently. Der be an earth fury called Amethon that be covered in powerful crystals in a cave up above Kuuro's Claim. Da crystals' hummin' be drivin' da fury crazy! We want a sample to see if we can figure out why da crystals are so powerful. I wouldn't be askin' ya if I thought anybody else could do it, commander. "
4256,Equipment Blueprint: True Iron Rudder,Return the blueprints to a Naval Equipment Specialist at your garrison shipyard. ,This appears to be a blueprint for some sort of naval equipment.  We should take it back to our Shipyard and see if someone can decipher it. 
4257,The Intricate Pendant,Ask around your garrison to see if anyone recognizes the pendant. ,"The crimson gem used in this pendant is unlike any you've seen before, and the filigree wrapped around it is masterfully crafted. There's likely to be much you can learn from the person who made this. Perhaps someone at your garrison will recognize the work. "
4258,A Warrior's Shroud,Locate a Frostwolf leatherworker in Wor'gol that can help you. ,"Although this cloak has seen better days, the workmanship is still quite impressive. Any normal cloak would have most certainly fallen apart by now. Perhaps one of the Frostwolf orcs within Wor'gol would be willing to help you repair it. "
4259,Botani Invasion! ,Repel the botani invasion of your garrison. ,There's a weight in the air. Reminds me of battles in Stranglethorn Valley. Jungle warfare is good for axe-play. 
4260,Pets Versus Pests,Defeat the three pests in your garrison. ,"I been tryin' ta get dis place ready for your pets, but we uncovered some rude pests while buildin' da garrison.  I tried takin' care o' dem myself, but they be too tough for my little friends. Beat da angry carrot in da garden, da rat eatin' our food, and da ornery water creature harassing da fishermen.  If you can do it, I be free to finish up da work on your menagerie. "
4261,Scrying Hard or Hardly Scrying,Retrieve Urna's Fathomstaff from Urna Darkfathom at Shadowmoon Enclave in Shadowmoon Valley. ,"There are others that harness the shadows to do their bidding. You know of them, commander. . . the Shadowmoon orcs. They have begun to master their craft. . . they call to the shadows beyond this realm. . . I desire their power. They have one who possesses a staff of particular interest. . . we should claim it as our own. "
4262,Equipment Blueprint: High Intensity Fog Lights,Return the blueprints to a Naval Equipment Specialist at your garrison shipyard. ,This appears to be a blueprint for some sort of naval equipment.  We should take it back to our Shipyard and see if someone can decipher it.

4264,A Mysterious Satchel,Find the satchel's owner. ,"An empty satchel with an old, magical aura. It appears quite dilapidated, with remnants of herbs and mushrooms along the inner lining. Perhaps exploring Umbrafen will offer a clue. "

4267,Unintelligible Intelligence,Look around Wor'gol for someone who can help translate the notes. ,"The notes are unreadable, but based on previous experience, the text appears to be very similar to standard Orcish. It is possible that the notes could contain strategic information. Perhaps it would be of great value to the Frostwolf Orcs. Someone in Wor'gol might be able to help interpret the text. "
4268,The Mysterious Flask,Speak to Lo'nash at your garrison. ,"The liquid swirling around inside the flask clearly has strong alchemical properties, but its nature is beyond your training. You have heard that one of the Stonefang refugees at your garrison has some knowledge of the alchemy of Draenor. Perhaps he could tell you more? "
4269,Equipment Blueprint: Bilge Pump,Return the blueprints to a Naval Equipment Specialist at your garrison shipyard. ,This appears to be a blueprint for some sort of naval equipment.  We should take it back to our Shipyard and see if someone can decipher it.

A decisive assault on their training grounds should prevent dem from musterin' the forces dey be needin' to stand against us, and will help remind them that we are not an enemy they want to be makin'. "
4271,Shadowmoon Invasion! ,Repel the Shadowmoon clan invasion of your garrison. ,"Scouts say the Shadowmoon clan looms close, ready with their necromancy. If I die and rise again, Commander, finish me quickly. I don't want to be a ghoul. "
4272,The Black Claw,Ask Fanny Firebeard about the Black Claw of Sethe. ,"Behind me, as ye can probably see, is a giant black claw. We found it while we were out hunting new beasts to tame. The animals seem to be quite afraid of it, perhaps the beast it belonged to used to hunt them. "
4273,An Ogre Without His Sword. . . ,Retrieve Tormmok's Favorite Sword from Vizier Dar'gud at Broken Precipice in Nagrand. ,"Before I was shipped off to Gorgrond, I was stationed at the Broken Precipice in Nagrand, maintaining order over the unruly dredges. Vizier Dar'gud refused to let me take my favorite sword; he told me ""I wouldn't need it where I was going. ""I want it back, commander, and we are powerful enough together to take it from Dar'gud's bloody corpse. It would mean a great deal to me. An ogre without his sword isn't an ogre at all. "
4274,Assault on Lost Veil Anzu,Assault the hostile creatures at Lost Veil Anzu in Spires of Arak. ,"Some of our best scouts have gone missing in the vicinity of the lost ruins of Veil Anzu.

Rokhan has requested any available resources be dispatched to identify the threat and see if any of our men yet remain alive within the ruins. "
4275,The Restless Spirit,Slay Kurgthuk the Merciless and use Waruk's hammer to salvage equipment from the Thunderlord orcs. ,"This hammer was once used to craft magnificent weapons for my Frostwolf brothers and sisters. When I was taken prisoner by the Thunderlords, however, I refused to wield it. How could I craft weapons to be used against my own people? It saddens me to see that it has been damaged and abused. I wished to one day pass it down to Kugra, but now, her anger prevents her from even visiting my grave. Please $p, can you help me repair my hammer and seek revenge on those that caused this? For Kugra. . . . "
4276,Enchanted Highmaul Bracer,Take the bracer to Eileese Shadowsong in your Garrison. ,"A powerful enchantment emanates from these ancient Highmaul bracers.

Maybe Eileese Shadowsong, your garrison enchanting quartermaster, can tell you more about the bracer. "

4278,The Mysterious Flask,Speak to Aenir at your garrison. ,"The liquid swirling around inside the flask clearly has strong alchemical properties, but its nature is beyond your training. You have heard that one of the Eventide villagers at your garrison has some knowledge of the alchemy of Draenor. Perhaps he could tell you more? "
4280,What We Need,Collect 10 Drudgeboat Salvage. ,"I heard you guys hijacked and wrecked a ship on your way out of Tanaan. It's like my daddy always said: One man's wreck is another goblin's workshop. You should head down to the coast west of the garrison and see if you can't find any materials we might salvage. Oh, and uh. . . should probably watch yourself. I hear there are ogre raiders in the area. "
4281,Missive: Assault on the Gorian Proving Grounds,Assault the ogre forces at the Gorian Proving Grounds in Nagrand. ,"The ogres at the Gorian Proving Grounds are rousing champions to turn against our forces in Nagrand.

A decisive assault on their training grounds should prevent them from mustering the forces they need to stand against us, and will help remind them that we are not an enemy they want to make. "
4282,Things Are Not Goren Our Way,Kill Stonetooth in the Garrison Mine. ,"The abandoned mine shaft has been overrun with goren!  They seem to be responding to commands from a big one further down in the mine.  If you can take him out, the rest will probably retreat. Once you have those goren cleared out, we can get that mine up and working! "
4283,Iron Horde Invasion! ,Repel the Iron Horde invasion. ,There's smoke on the horizon. . . . The Iron Horde is coming. 
4284,Trega's Tailoring Kit,Find Trega in Wor'gol. ,"The bag is filled with patterns and unfamiliar tailoring tools. You find the name "" Trega "" embroidered on the inside of the bag. You seem to recall seeing her in Wor'gol. With any luck, she's still there. "
4285,A Power Lost,Find someone in Embaari Village well-versed in gemology and magic. ,<The fragment gleams in the light as its aura's final pulse fades. >The power within the fragment appears to be drained. You recall hearing travelers speak of a local in Embaari Village who specializes in imbuing gems with magic. 
4286,Assault on Shattrath Harbor,Assault the Sargerei forces at Shattrath City in Talador. ,"Shattrath City is in the hands of Sargerei forces under the leadership of the once Exarch, Socrethar.

The Shadow Council forces in the eastern portion of the city are gaining in power through the aid of demons from the Nether, and need to be culled before they become a threat to all of our operations. "
4287,Equipment Blueprint: Felsmoke Launchers,Return the blueprints to a Naval Equipment Specialist at your garrison shipyard. ,This appears to be a blueprint for some sort of naval equipment.  We should take it back to our Shipyard and see if someone can decipher it. 
4288,Transmutation Master,Bring the requested materials to an alchemy trainer in any capital city. ,"Iron to gold, water to fire. . . if you want to become an transmutation master, then I can show you the way. The training is very expensive, so you'll have to bring me some of the finest transmuted materials in the world. Remember <name>, you can only learn ONE specialization, so if you complete your transmutation training, then potion and elixir specialization will no longer be available. "
4289,Vault of the Wardens: Demon's Bile,"Craft a Skaggldrynk, then go to the Vault of the Wardens and bathe the crucible in the bile of Grimoira. ","The key to a crucible like this is that it must be bathed in the foulest of fel energy. I hate to say it, but the most efficient method of accomplishing such a feat is to subject it to the bile of a demon. Yes, I said the bile of a demon. Ready to get to work? In the Vault of the Wardens, such a demon exists. An imp mother by the name of Grimoira.  The door to her room is sealed by an invisible lock. I'd suggest bringing some Skaggldrynk with you. Use it when you get to her door. "
4290,Elixir Master,Bring a variety of flasks to an alchemy trainer in any capital city. ,"Elixirs are all about potency!  If you want to become an elixir master, I can teach you. I can't just train anyone, and I require proof that you are devoted before we continue.  Several flasks should be sufficient to show your dedication. Remember <name>, you can only learn ONE specialization, so if you complete your elixir training, then potion and transmutation specialization will no longer be available. "
4291,The Price of the Black Market,"Collect a Silver Hair of Khadgar, a Blood of Sargeras, 5 Kaldorei Ginger Wine and 5 Moist Azsunian Feta. ","I may have what you're looking for, burettes you say? Not a very common item. For that, I require a moderate favor. Nothing too big, just a few things really. A silver hair from a high-ranking archmage. . . the blood of a titan, and, oh. . . some wine and cheese. What? ! I have appetites that need satiating. "
4292,Ascending Alchemy,"Bring Funen 75 Astral Glory, 5 Primal Sargerite and a Bound Infernal Alchemist Stone. ","I've seen other alchemists come through our camp carrying interesting looking trinkets. I believe they refer to them as. . . ""alchemist stones""? I can sense the power they radiate, but they appear fel-tainted. The herb that grows on this planet is particularly good at cleansing corruption. I use it to purify the primal sargerite that's often found amongst the herbs. I'm certain that if we used a purified sargerite with one of those stones, we could elevate the power within it. "
4293,Potion Master,Bring a large supply of potions to an alchemy trainer in any capital city. ,"Potions, potions, potions.  Can I teach you about potions! You're going to have to bring me samples of your work, so I know you're ready. Remember <name>, you can only learn ONE specialization, so if you complete your potion training, then elixir and transmutation specialization will no longer be available. "
4294,Missing Shipments,Alchemist Deucus Valdera in Dalaran wants you to locate supplies lost near the water in Azsuna. ,"Now that we've gotten to know each other, perhaps you can lend me a hand. My weekly supply shipment was lost when my longtime courier--you know, old whatsername--was shot out of the sky over the shores of Azsuna. Surely a hardy sort like you could retrieve my lost goods. "
4295,Strange Spherical Stone,Infuse the stone with several Golden Lotus. ,"This beautiful stone clearly has magical potential. . . at least to one trained in alchemy.  You are certain that with the right herbs native to Pandaria, this stone could become very useful. "
4296,Maw of Souls: A Hope in Helheim,"Retrieve a crate of Dragur Dust from Heroic: Maw of Souls, craft a Flask of the Seventh Demon and return both items to Alard in Dalaran. ","For this last ingredient, well. . . <Alard begins pondering for a moment, then nods his head. >Yes, that's the only way. For this last one, you'll need to go to the land of the damned, Helheim. Well, not there exactly, but aboard the boat that ferries the dead across the Maw of Souls. Upon that boat may be the final ingredient we need. It's called Dragur Dust. Keep an eye out for it. Also, one needs to be quick when adding this ingredient. I'll need something to heighten my reflexes. "
4297,A Mysterious Text,Bring the Runewritten Tome to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"You found a water-logged tome near the bones of a massive creature. Written in an unfamiliar language, the book is adorned with runes and alchemical symbols. Perhaps another alchemist would be able to tell you more. "
4298,Flasking for a Favor,Seek out Barm Stonebreaker at the Ironhorn Enclave in Highmountain. ,"You know, this mixing flask didn't suffer terrible damage. I'm positive it can just be repaired. I'm no expert in glass repair, but I've heard of someone who is--a tauren by the name of Barm Stonebreaker. He's a smith by trade, but those who know him say he was born to work glass. Those tauren don't work for free, so you may be in for some work yourself. "
4299,Lining the Crucible,"Gather 1 Blood of Sargeras, 1 Felhide, 2 Felwort, and 100 Yseralline Seeds. ",The first step in making this crucible useful is to restore the lining of its interior. That's going to require supplies you'll either gather yourself or obtain through trade with fellow adventurers. Felwort and yseralline seeds are familiar to herbalists. Felhide is obtained through skinning. Blood of Sargeras can be found all over the Broken Isles. 
4300,Get Your Mix On,Deucus Valdera in Dalaran wants you to craft some new potions. ,"Let's see. . . potion stains on your tabard, crushed herbs on your boots. . . I know a fellow alchemist when I see one! We will do good work together, the two of us. I trust you're not averse to learning new tricks. Be sure to use my state-of-the-art alchemy table. I built her myself! "
4301,Elixirs for the Bladeleafs,Bring 6 Elixirs of Lion's Strength and 2 Elixirs of Minor Defense to Syral Bladeleaf in Dolanaar. ,"Our herb and alchemy shop is booming, but my husband spends so much time mixing potions that we never have time for each other. Can you help us? If you can bring me a supply of pre-made elixirs, then I would be happy to trade with you.  I have some rare herbs that you might find useful. "
4302,Testing the Calibration,Test the Malloric Burettes' calibration by crafting a variety of potions. ,"Now that you have the burettes calibrated, it's time to test them out! The only way to be sure is by crafting a sufficient quantity of a variety of potions. Glamorous work? No, but the most important reagent in alchemy is a bit of elbow grease! "
4303,"Black Rook Hold: Heavy, But Helpful","Retrieve some Sabelite Sulfate from Heroic: Black Rook Hold, craft a Flask of the Countless Armies and return both items to Alard in Dalaran. ","The next ingredient on the list will supposedly add strength to the mix, according to Deucus. I've heard of it before, but haven't really used it. It's called Sabelite Sulfate, and it's said the elves of Black Rook Hold use it in their blacksmithing. Something like that won't just be lying around. You may have to delve deep into the hold to find it. And due to its weight, I may need a concoction of yours to compensate, something to give me a bit more strength. "
4304,Calibration Experts,Take the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to skilled alchemists for calibration. ,"It will take the cooperation of several highly skilled sorts to calibrate these burettes for a variety of substances. Chemist Emmara is an old friend from the Undercity who has helped me with similar endeavors. Thunder Bluff smells like a barn to me, but Jana Winterhoof is an alchemist with exacting standards. And while I'd never travel to Booty Bay without a lock on my wallet, Tryks Pourtrue has proven reliable and fair. "
4305,In With the New,Bring the newly forged High-Capacity Decoction Conduit to Deucus in Dalaran. ,"Well, here's your new conduit. Try not to break this one, I really don't feel like making another. Oh, and tell your boss, Deucus, that he owes me big time for this. "
4306,Silver Filigree Flask,Fill the vial with a potent alchemical mixture. ,"You have found a beautiful silver flask decorated with ornate filigree.  With the right materials and your skill in alchemy, it could become quite magical. "
4307,A Recipe for Success,Bring the torn paper back to Elric. ,"Looking it over more closely, you're convinced that this must be the missing half of the recipe you came for. An odd signature completes the recipe, signed, ""Silas Darkmoon"". Elric should be very pleased to see this once again. "
4308,A Fragile Crucible,Bring the Fragile Demonsbreath Crucible to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"I have customers asking for alchemist stones, but I'm unable to make any until I replace my crucible. In order to create a new one, we'll need a few things, but first we'll need a proper container. Something that can be augmented to withstand a demon's breath. There's a place in Suramar which the Legion has occupied. There surely must be a device there we can take that will be suitable for our needs. "
4309,The Emerald Nightmare: Rage Fire,Travel to the Emerald Nightmare and acquire Nythendra's Heart. ,"Now that we have all the ingredients assembled, we need one last thing. The fire of my forges burn hot, but not hot enough to work these ingredients into glass. For that, we need more heat. The heat of a dragon, to be exact. I'm aware of one that has emerged from the Emerald Dream in a corrupted state. Corrupted or not, a dragon's heart burns with enough heat to melt the strongest of materials. Bring me its heart and you'll have your conduit. "
4310,Limited Supplies,Go to the Petrified Forest and reclaim 12 Used Vials. ,"Hello, <name>. It's good to see a fellow alchemist again. I've been supplying our camp with necessary potions to deal with the demons, but lately I've been running low on supplies. Normally when scouting parties go out, they return with empty vials, but as of late fewer have been returning. I try to recycle as much as I can, so you see, those vials are precious to me. If you'd be willing to go out and retrieve them, I could show you what I've been making to help combat the demons. "
4311,Halls of Valor: The Prime Ingredient,"Retrieve the Eternity Sand from Heroic: Halls of Valor, craft a Flask of Ten Thousand Scars and return both items to Alard in Dalaran. ","This first ingredient can only be obtained by visiting the next realm. Fortunately for us, there's a gate in Stormheim that can take you there. In the Halls of Valor, there is a sand that's used for polishing their architecture. Eternity Sand, it's called. I'll need an ample amount of it as the base for the new glass. This ingredient won't be easy to work with either. I'll need something to keep me going, you know, keep my stamina up. "
4312,Ley Hunting,Travel to key locations in Azsuna and use the Depleted Leyflame Burner to collect ley energy. ,"The leyflame burner you brought me is useless! This is why I never trust an engineer. . . The burner needs to be charged in areas that resonate with ley energy before it can be used to craft our newfound alchemy recipes. Lucky for us, Azsuna is rich with such power. "
4313,Casting the First Stone,Craft a Potion of Durability and a Potion of Shifting States using the recipes given to you. ,"Hey dere <name>, gimme a hand with dis, would ya? <Kumali motions you over to her. >I got dis recipe dat I've been trying to remember de rest of, but I'm having de hardest time coming up with de right ingredients. Ya see, my partner ran off with de other half of de recipe on account of a disagreement we had. But dis stone, it's a treasure like no other. Grab some vials and start mixing dese ingredients together. Let's see if dey are de right ones. "
4314,Tracking the Trackers,Kill 14 Feflame Scavengers at the Annihilan Pits. ,"<name>, have I told you about my tracking potion? Our scouts use it to track demons, especially their ""fiends"". Those particular creatures tend to consume the astral glory in the area, making it difficult to replenish our stores of the herb. If you could help thin their numbers out, it would greatly help us from having to search elsewhere for supplies. You can find many of them in the Annihilan Pits. I could also teach you the recipe for this potion for your effort. "
4315,Going Underground,See Ms. ,"We're so close to replacing all my equipment, <name>. In order to make flasks again, we need to be able to precisely measure each ingredient. For that, we need to replace my burette assembly. Unfortunately, burettes aren't easy to come by. We may be able to procure some though through other means by. . . <Deucus looks around and beckons you closer. >Going underground, so to say. As in, the Black Market. Go see Ms. Xiulan. Mum's the word. "
4316,A Dormant Burner,Purchase a Depleted Leyflame Burner from Hobart Grapplehammer and bring it to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,I've heard that someone over in the engineering shop is selling a burner that might be usable. You could likely negotiate a fairer price than I could! The shop is just across the street. I'll make a note on your map for you. 
4317,A Recipe for Success,Bring the torn paper back to Kumali. ,"Looking it over more closely, you're convinced that this must be the missing half of the recipe you came for. An odd signature completes the recipe, signed, ""Silas Darkmoon"". Kumali should be very pleased to see this once again. "
4318,Neltharion's Lair: Potent Powder,Acquire Precipitating Powder in Neltharion's Lair and bring it to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"I've heard rumors that the ancient drogbar collected powder from the residue of dragon's breath. If it's true that Neltharion's Lair lies somewhere below us, it seems a likely source. Go there and try to find a replacement for my powder. "
4319,Vault of the Wardens: Bendy Glass Tubes,Bring the Bendy Glass Tubes to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"You find tubing formed from a bendable sort of glass. It appears as though Grimoira was using it to suck out the insides of her victims. Its magical properties, however, would seem ideal for use on an advanced alchemy table. "
4320,Trading for Dreams,Use the Nightborne Flask to craft an Ysera's Dream Draught. ,"From the look of you, I take it you're an alchemist, yes? I'd be willing to trade my services with you for a price that I deem is fair. I have been away from Suramar for some time now. I long for an Ysera's Dream Draught. To concoct it, you'll need some dreamleaf as well as the leaves of a Dreamer's Tear. One grows not to far from here in the clearing of some ruins. Take my flask, make this drink for me, and I'll do as you ask. "
4321,Ancient Knowledge,Observe Deucus Valdera as he attempts one of the vrykul recipes. ,"The tome contains a wealth of ancient vrykul recipes! Why, I could be the first alchemist in untold ages to craft one! How fortunate for you, friend <name>, that you are here to bear witness to my greatness! Awful kind of that Svena person to die and leave her book for us, eh? Silly vrykul. . . "
4322,Eye of Azshara: Put a Cork in It,Go to the Eye of Azshara and retrieve the Advanced Corks for Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"A thought occurred to me recently, <name>. The naga have been known to hoard all manner of potions, so they might have the sort of corks we need. In my educated opinion, I believe the best place to start searching is around the Eye of Azshara! Try not to waste your time in there dealing with the naga's goings on, just look for some replacement corks. "
4323,Calibration Experts,Take the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to skilled alchemists for calibration. ,"It will take the cooperation of several highly skilled sorts to calibrate these burettes. Myshalla Streambreeze in Feralas has demonstrated admirable attention to detail. I loathe Ironforge, but a resident named Krimple Proxmeasure is known for his precision. And while I'd never travel to Booty Bay without a lock on my wallet, Tryks Pourtrue has proven reliable and fair. . . mostly. "
4324,Cardinal Ruby,Linzy Blackbolt in Dalaran wants you to successfully transmute 5 epic gems with your alchemy skill. ,"The Cardinal Ruby is said to be the finest gem in all of Northrend.  It sparkles like a crystal rose under the sun. Before I teach you this recipe, I ask that you perform five epic gem transmutes to prepare your mind.  You can do any you like, and even do the same transmute many times. Return to me when you are truly ready. "
4325,There's a Scribe for That,Bring the Runewritten Tome to Professor Pallin in Dalaran. ,"Fine! I admit, even my considerable intellect can't translate the strange tome you discovered. No doubt the water smears made it illegible. Say, one of those dimwitted scribes down the block owes me a favor. This sort of busywork is just his cup of tea. "
4326,Channeling Our Efforts,Talk to Alard Schmied about the list of things you need done. ,"While it's no secret my time is more valuable than. . . well, anyone's, I fear I must step in and help to replace my decoction conduit. You will also play a crucial part in this, <name>, as my liaison with the blacksmiths. The thought of getting soot on my robes curls my toes. Here's a list of what we'll need done. Meanwhile I'll be out gathering the rest of what's needed. "
4327,Mending the Filter,Try to find the whereabouts of a tailor in Val'sharah who can help you mend the silk. ,Bringing back the cloth in such a manner would not be beneficial to Deucus. Perhaps there's a tailor here in Val'sharah who'd be willing to mend it for you. The priestess who helped you earlier may know of such a person. 
4328,Casting the First Stone,Craft a Potion of Durability and a Potion of Shifting States using the recipes given to you. ,"Would you mind helping me out with something, <name>? <Elric motions you over to him. >You see, I have this recipe that, well, I only have half of currently. I've been trying to remember the other half but just can't seem to recall it. My EX-partner tore the recipe and ran off with the other half over a disagreement we were having. But the stone it makes is invaluable. How about you grab some vials and start mixing the ingredients on this list. Perhaps together we can figure this out. "
4329,Ocular Extracts,Gather 10 Highlands Mauler Eyes and return them to Elric. ,"My next idea involves a creature whose eyes are useful for certain alchemical recipes. At least for potions they are. Hopefully they're just what we need for this and there aren't any further. . . miscalculations. Although, I don't entirely recall seeing them on the recipe's ingredient list. . . but my memory isn't exactly as good as it used to be. Oh, you caught me rambling. How about you get those eyes and I'll start making the preparations for them. "
4330,A Deathly Draught,Collect 15 Deathshrooms. ,"De first thing I'd like you to do for me is to gather some deathshroom. Don't worry if you're not skilled at herbalism, they're very easy to pick. Dey typically grow where death lingers in the air. I'd try to de Frogmarsh to de southeast. De trolls dere have been making sacrifices of de creature dat inhabit de area. "
4331,We Need More Powder! ,Obtain Katterin's Alchemy Kit from Katterin the Blistered in Stormheim. ,"The substance you brought me appears to be precipitating powder, a highly volatile reagent used by the vrykul in their recipes. There are rumors that a vrykul elder named Katterin has built up quite a store of this powder. A substance this dangerous needs to be in our hands, not hers! "
4332,The Search for Knowledge,Look for ancient relics  on the shoreline of Azsuna. ,"While you were out gallivanting, did you notice any lost relics around Azsuna? My sources tell me there are treasures to be found. These rumors merit investigation! "
4333,Return the Filter,Return the Mended Shaldorei Silk to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"What was torn has now been mended. I hope you put this Shaldorei silk to good use. Now, run along. "
4334,Changing the Scenery,Go to Stormsong Valley and transmute Barberry Shrubs into Shrubbery Bubbles and gather 6 of them. ,"The stone this recipe becomes is a transmutation stone. What if the missing reagents to make it come from something that's gone through the transmutation process? I'm willing to try anything at this point. Here's an old recipe my ex-partner devised. He used to go out to Stormsong Valley, just south of the Highland Flats and change the shrubs there into bubbles. Bring back some of those bubbles and we'll see if they're what we've been missing. "
4335,Forlorn Filter,Speak with a Temple Priestess at the Temple of Elune to see if you can acquire some Shaldorei Silk. ,Next on the list of things to replace are my filters. Now I'm sure you've concluded that an alchemist of my caliber uses only the finest of tools when mixing my potions. The elves at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah use Shaldorei silk to craft their robes. Perhaps they'd be willing to part with some for my filters. 
4336,Furbolg Firewater,Acquire skins of Smolderhide Firewater from the furbolg camp in Val'sharah. ,"Oh! I recognize these corks you brought me, <name>. I recently acquired several from a furbolg tribe in Val'sharah. They need sturdy corks to keep a tight seal on that potent firewater they brew. We need more firewater potions--the corks would make an ideal addition to our alchemy table! "
4337,Thanks for Flasking,Take the repaired Dual-Chambered Mixing Flask to Deucus Valdera in Dalaran. ,"Here is your flask, good as new. A fair trade for those potions. Be a little more careful with your breakables next time! "
4338,An Imprecise Burette,Bring the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to Deucus in Dalaran. ,"Here are your burettes. Should you ever be in the need of anything else, don't hesitate to ask. < Ms. Xiulan holds up the hair and continues to chuckle to herself. >"
4339,Chemically Compounded,Meet Quintin at the cave he mentioned. ,"That appears to be everything. This latest transmutation will be my finest yet. And your prize waits at its completion, apprentice. But I don't believe this is an appropriate place to test it out. It may draw too much attention. There's a cave not terribly far from here which would prove to be a more suitable setting for such a test. Meet me there when you're ready to witness why transmutation is the only branch of alchemy worth learning. "
4340,Ocular Extracts,Gather 10 Razorwing Eyes and return them to Kumali. ,"So dere's a creature in dese lands whose eyes are perfect for alchemical recipes. Dey might just be de thing we need to finish dis project. Although, I don't remember seeing dem on de full recipe list de last time I saw it, ya see. . . But my memory isn't quite what it used to be. Gah! I'm rambling too much. Get me some eyes, will ya, <name>? "
4341,Changing the Scenery,Go to The Slough and transmute Barberry Shrubs into Shrubbery Bubbles and gather 6 of them. ,"Or maybe de problem is dat we don't need regular reagents. Maybe we need something dat only comes from being transmuted. Anything's worth a shot at dis point. Here is a recipe my old partner left behind. He used to go out to de Slough and change de shrubs into bubbles, ya see. Why, you might ask? 'Cause he loved transmuting everything. Part of de reason we never saw eye to eye. Anyways, bring me back some of dose bubbles and we'll see if we can use dem to make dis stone. "
4342,A Deathly Draught,Collect 15 Deathshrooms. ,"The first thing I'd like you to do for me is to gather some deathshroom. Don't worry if you're not skilled at herbalism, they're very easy to pick. They typically grow where death lingers in the air. I'd try to the Crimson Forest to the south. The creatures that have overrun it seem to be covered in deathly magics. "
4343,A Stone's Throw,Use the Bag of Transmutation Stones on blood trolls and kill them. ,"Now dis ingredient you might have some fun getting, little mixah. I'm gonna give you dese stones. They're able to turn things into other things. Dose blood trolls, de ones giving de rest of us a bad name? Dey drink de weirdest things and it taints their bodies. I need their blood to finish my work here, but without de taint. Dese stones will turn dem into weaker creatures. Although, sometimes de stones turn dem into other things. . . Be careful with dem. "
4344,A Possible Solution,Travel to Drustvar and seek out Quintin Whalgrene. ,"Nothing appears to be working. I can't believe I'm proposing this but I actually think we need to contact Quintin. Well, you should, as I doubt he'll speak to me. Perhaps you could convince him to part with the other half of the recipe? Last time I heard, he was staying in Drustvar near Arom's Stand. There's a lot of alchemists in those parts, but he shouldn't be too hard to find. Best not to tell him I sent you. He may not be as forthcoming with the recipe. "
4345,Alchemical Equations,"Hey, &lt; name&gt; . ","Hey, <name>. I recently created some new recipes I'd love to share with you. "
4346,A Possible Solution,Travel to Nazmir and seek out Zukashi. ,"None of dese things are working. I can't believe I'm saying dis, but I think you're gonna have to find Zukashi. Maybe you could convince him to give up de other half of de recipe. He's pretty full of himself, but he isn't unreasonable. Last time I heard, he's staying in Nazmir near Gloom Hollow. Maybe it's best to tell him dis isn't about me. "
4347,Chemically Compounded,Meet Zukashi at the cave he mentioned. ,"Now dat I have everything I need, I can finish dis project. My latest transmuation will be my finest yet! But dis is not de place to test it. It could draw too much attention. If you want to see it for yourself, little mixah, meet me to de north. Dere is a cave dere dat should be a safe spot for testing dis out. "
4348,A Stone's Throw,Use the Bag of Transmutation Stones on witches and kill them. ,"You may enjoy getting this next reagent for me. I have some special stones that have transmutative qualities, especially on living things. It's not too unlike the one you're trying to make. The witches that plague these lands are imbued with magic. As is their blood. I need their blood to finish my latest project, but in an altered form. These stones should turn them into weaker creatures. Although, sometimes the opposite occurs. . . I'd recommend handling them with care. "
4349,Alchemical Equations,"&lt; name&gt; , nice to see you again. ","<name>, nice to see you again. I've been working on some new recipes dat I think you'd be interesting in learning. "
4350,Unspeakable Power,Meet with Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher in Suramar. ,"<name>, I received an urgent message from the High Examiner requesting your presence. He's finally found something powerful-- VERY powerful--and he wants your help in recovering it. Be careful down there, <name>. Tae'thelan can be a tad fanatical when it comes to artifacts that hold any sort of energy. "
4351,Narrowing Down,Survey Suramar and uncover 10 Tattered Highborne Scrolls. ,"I was right about the nightborne here having objects of great power. I found an ancient text referring to such an object called the Orb of Sciallax. From what I recall in studying the War of the Ancients, Sciallax was a demon lord who came to Suramar and offered the elves at the time a powerful artifact in return for their servitude to the Legion. I haven't discovered the exact location yet as to the whereabouts, but perhaps some digging can yield us an answer. "
4352,Uncovering the Orb of Sciallax,Meet Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher at the entrance to the chamber where the Orb of Sciallax is held. ,We'll need to hurry before the nightborne realize what we're after. I'm bringing the goblins along in case we run into any obstacles along the way. I've marked the location of the entrance to the chamber the Orb resides in on your map. Meet me there as soon as you're ready and we'll claim this artifact for our own. 
4353,The Right Path,Meet with Lessah in Highmountain. ,"This new shop is shaping up quite nicely, I think. Still, there's so much left to organize. <name>, Lessah has requested your presence in Highmountain. Something about a moose? I'm not sure to what she's speaking of, but as soon as you have a chance, please go see her. "
4354,Laying to Rest,Find 600 Bone Fragments of Eche'ro and return them to Lessah in Highmountain. ,"If I was able to find a bone fragment in what appeared to be a random location, then that means Eche'ro's bones must be scattered around Highmountain. We must find his remains and give him the proper burial he deserved. Oh, I'm sorry, in case you weren't aware, Eche'ro was Huln Highmountain's mount and companion. He deserves to be honored as Huln once was. "
4355,Corrupted Studies,Survey digsites in Stormheim and bring Brann back 200 War of the Ancients Fragments. ,"Stormheim is steeped with artifacts from tha War of the Ancients. Demon artifacts ta be exact. I think these artifacts can clue us into some knowledge about their leader, Sargeras. I've already found some fragments to a titan disc, but need ta find the rest of 'em. I need ya ta dig around Stormheim and see if ye can find any more fragments so we can reassemble the disc. "
4356,Neltharion's Lair: Misdirected,Go to Neltharion's Lair and recover the Ancient Highmountain Artifact. ,"I've been looking into the history of Huln Highmountain, a legendary warrior from the War of the Ancients whom this very land is named after. Allegedly some of his personal effects were carried here after his death and have been lost in time. After some digging around I believe I have discovered the location of one of his artifacts to be in a place called Neltharion's Lair. I'm no fighter, <name>, but you are. Will you go and recover this artifact for me? "
4357,Out of the Frying Pan,Meet with Brann in Azsuna. ,"Oh hello, <name>. I tell you, ever since I was given this shop, it's been nothing but a headache. I can't seem to ever find what I'm looking for. Which reminds me, Brann Bronzebeard has sent for you. He's in Azsuna tracking down more pieces of whatever it is he's searching for. Now where'd those pewter drinking cups go. . . "
4358,Bits and Pieces,Meet with Brann Bronzebeard in Stormheim. ,"So many artifacts to catalogue, and never enough time. Good to see you again, <name>. Brann Bronzebeard and the Explorers' League are in Stormheim right now and could use your help tracking down an ancient titan relic. Brann can fill you in on the details when you arrive. "
4359,The Apocalypse Bringer,Talk to Brann when you're ready to activate the device. ,"Right, well, I managed to piece the device back together. I guess I'll jes' turn it on when you're ready and we'll see what happens, yea? "
4360,Academic Exploration,Meet with Tae'thelan in Azsuna. ,"<name>, good to see you. What do you think of my shop so far? Not too bad for just one person, huh? By the way, High Examiner Tae'thalan has been digging around Azsuna, and asked that I send you to see him. Knowing him, he probably thinks he's found yet another world-shatteringly powerful artifact. "
4361,Dark Iron Contingency Plan,"These are definitely some sort of plans, but for what you aren't certain. ","Interesting!  It seems as if the Dark Iron dwarves had a strategic plan in the case of an elemental invasion.  As the elemental forces are ageless and unchanging, it seems as if these ancient techniques are still viable even today. "
4362,History of Highmountain,Meet with Lessah in Highmountain. ,"Let's see, one. . . two. . . three. . . oh, hello <name>. Sorry I didn't see you come in. Things have been hectic around here. I could really use an assistant. I do have something for you though, a fellow archaeologist named Lessah has been asking for someone to help her in Highmountain. I thought you'd be the perfect person for the job. "
4363,A Beacon of Hope,Go to the location Tae'thelan marked on your map and survey the area until you find the artifact. ,"I've marked the location of the artifact on your map. It's in a rather hostile location, so I'd like you to go there and find it. When you've recovered it, bring it back to me so I can discern its power. "
4364,Echoes of My Ancestors,Complete 25 Highborne Archaeology Projects. ,"This land holds many secrets and many artifacts of ancient times. From what I've been able to discern there's an artifact of great power close to here. I just need to narrow down its location. I'd like you to dig up more artifacts and learn what you can. When you feel you've done enough research, come back to me and share your knowledge. "
4365,Drogbar Deception,Recover the ancient necklace and bring it back to Lessah. ,"According to my research and the information you gave me, I've isolated the location of the necklace. It's deep in a drogbar cave, and I'm willing to bet they're not just going to hand it over to you, <name>. I need you to recover that necklace at any cost. "
4366,Worth Its Weight,Meet with Tae'thelan in Suramar. ,"<name>, if you were a crate of black trilobites, where do you think I would have put you? <Dariness begins looking around the shop. >Oh, that reminds me. Tae'thelan has requested your presence. He's onto something in Suramar and needs your help. "
4367,Pristine Stonewood Bow,Put the artifact on display. ,"This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition, suitable for display in Dalaran's archaeology shop. "
4368,The Gates of Valor,Obtain 6 Chipped Titan Disc Fragments by surveying near the Gates of Valor in Stormheim. ,"Ye'd not normally know it, but the terraced entrance to the vrykul's Halls o' Valor is a fine place for findin' ancient artifacts. Problem is, the place is just a big mess with demons at the time. Well, ye've not got much choice. If the disc isn't elsewhere in Stormheim, it most likely lies at the Gates of Valor. Good luck, <name>. "
4369,Sifting Through the Rubble,Survey different areas around Suramar until you find the 6 missing Jewels of the Crown. ,"Then I believe it's clear what we must do next. Find the jewels. They're bound to be here somewhere in Suramar, so we better start looking. I'll coordinate the search from here, while you and my assistants look for the jewels. "
4370,A New Lead,Meet with Lessah in Highmountain. ,"<name>, Lessah in Highmountain has been asking for you. Apparently she's caught a lead on some ancient piece of armor that Huln Highmountain used to wear. When you can, make your way out to her. "
4371,Vengeance of the Wildhammer,"These old bones appear dwarven, possibly from the original builders of Grim Batol. ","After comparing the two very closely, you are sure these are the remains of the Wildhammer.  The treachery committed against them fills your heart with anger. "
4372,Fragments of the Fjords,Meet with Brann Bronzebeard in Stormheim. ,"<name>, have you seen my ledger around here? I seemed to have misplaced it when I was stowing some canopic jars. Oh, nevermind. Brann Bronzebeard has sent for you though. He's in Stormheim continuing his research. Make your way out to him and let him know I'm still waiting on those flayed-skin chronicles he found. "
4373,One Step Closer,Meet with Brann in Suramar. ,"<name>! I just heard that Brann Bronzebeard - that crazy, titan-obsessed dwarf - has decided to go hunting for his precious disc in Suramar. Talk about the last place you'd want to go digging around, given the current events. I'm sure he could use your help. "
4374,The Reliquary Calls,Meet with Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher in Azsuna. ,"Tae'thelan of the Reliquary has asked me to send anyone who may be able to help them in Azsuna. Seeing as how you happened into my shop purely by coincidence, I thought you'd be willing to go, <name>. Back to work for me though. So much to do and so little help. <Dariness lets out a sigh. >"
4375,Fel Fragments,Deliver the crate of surveying equipment to Brann in Val'sharah. ,"Brann Bronzebeard has requested that I send him more surveying equipment, but I just don't have the time. Would you be a dear and take this crate to him, <name>? I'd truly appreciate it. "
4376,Dark Secrets,Meet Brann at the entrance to the secret chamber. ,I fixed the key and am ready to open the chamber. Meet me there when you have a chance and we'll discover what waits inside together! 
4377,Darkheart Thicket: Through the Fog,Obtain the Final Chapter of The Purple Hills of Eredath. ,"I can't believe that after all that searchin' ye did, it's still missing a chapter! I'm willin' ta bet that those satyrs got a hand on it and took it somewhere. Probably somewhere dark where no one could find it. I've heard rumors of a place, the Darkheart Thicket they call it, where the strongest of the satyrs are. If I had ta guess, I'd say ye need to go there and look around fer it. "
4378,The Keys to Success,Bring the mold to Alard Schmied in Dalaran and have him help you forge a new set of keys. ,"I'd like you to take the mold to the blacksmith in Dalaran. Alard, I believe his name is. Have him help you forge a new set of keys. I found some writing on the back of the mold that may hold the answer to what these keys unlock. I'll stay here and try to translate the text. "
4379,Pristine Carved Bronze Mirror,Put the artifact on display. ,"This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the Seat of Knowledge, so that lorewalkers and archaeologists can study it. "

4382,And Into the Fel Fire,Survey digsites in Azsuna and find 10 missing Parts of the Infernal Device and bring them back to Brann. ,"I found something, <name>. Well, a couple of things actually. First I found an ancient text talking about a demon who harnessed the power of the titan disc I've been searching for. Then I found a device which supposedly is used to summon 'im! Only, it's missin' some pieces from what I can make out. I'm sure if we survey around Azsuna some more, those missin' pieces are sure ta turn up. "
4383,What Once Was Lost,Go to the location marked on the map and recover the artifact in question. ,"That reminds me, I found a map to a chamber that may or may not hold something of value. It doesn't seem to have any power associated with it, which is why I'm handing it over to you. Here, take some more explosives. They may help speed of the process of finding it. "
4384,Tol'vir Hieroglyphics,This gravestone marks a strange burial site - possibly from one of the original builders. ,"Using the keystone, you confirm the grave is from one of the original builders, and you learn important details of the mummification process. "

I'm certain I can restore it if we can find the other bits. After that, we need to figure out what it's a key to. An' I think I know how to do that. I've been studying some of the artifacts I've found, and they seem to be pointing to a hidden chamber. I jes' need some more artifacts to study. "

4410,Crystal Eyes,Interact with the two different resonating stones in Highmountain. ,"I've delved into the caves here and have discovered many ancient writings. The most interesting I've found are resonating crystals, where the drogbar have resided. Unfortunately, they aren't on very good terms with the tauren here and this has hindered my research. I thought, should there be any trouble with the drogbar, that you'd be able to handle them. I'd like you to continue my research and discover what you can about Huln. "

4413,Process of Elimination,Dig around Stormheim until you find a piece of the Titan Disc. ,"With so many places ta dig up fragments, it's become quite a pain figuring out where ta look for more of the titan disc. I have a plan though. I need ye ta eliminate potential areas where the disc could exist so we can narrow down where in Stormheim it might exist. You take part of the area an' I'll take the other part. Meet back here if ye find anythin'. "

I'm done with alternate means of digging for now, and wish to focus on the right way to do things. That being said, I believe I've found a new powerful artifact and I'll do literally anything to have it. I've uncovered a fragment that appears to be a mold for a key. I now simply need the other pieces. "

I found something here that I think ye'll be interested in. It's a page of a book talking about the world of Argus. But before the demons destroyed it. Anyway, it's been me experience that if ye find one of something, there's sure ta be more of it around. Keep lookin' around Val'sharah for more of these pages and bring what ye find back ta me.

And if you know anything about goblins, you know that I'm talking about explosives. We've only run a few tests here at my camp, but I would appreciate your help in testing this method out in the field. I've marked a location on your map that has some particularly difficult digs. "

4445,A Head for Metal,Collect 1 Crystallized Draconium inside the Cindershard Seam. ,"To fully utilize the potential of the Earth-Warder's forge, you must learn the basics of creating Obsidian Seared Alloy. Only then can you follow in the footsteps of Neltharion's greatest smiths.

Bring me a piece of Crystallized Draconium found deep within the Cindershard Seam. Then I shall gift you the knowledge you desire. "
4446,Supplying the Front,Bring 6 Copper Axes and 6 Copper Chain Belts to Thorvald in the southern guard tower of Loch Modan. ,"The mountaineers of Loch Modan are fighting troggs, and having a busy time of it!  They need constant supplies of new armor and weapons if we're ever to get a handle on those troggs. That's why my colleague Thorvald is there, trying to keep the mountaineers in good gear.  So if you were to make some copper axes and copper chain belts and bring them to Thorvald, he would be obliged.  He might even share his knowledge with you. Thorvald is in Loch Modan's southern guard tower. "
4447,The Firmament Stone,Speak with Barm Stonebreaker in Highmountain. ,"When working with felslate and demonsteel, one must use special equipment. Specifically, an anvil hard enough to withstand the energy given off when felslate is hammered. Urael and I no longer possess such an anvil. But your friends, the Highmountain tauren, do. Gain access to the Firmament Stone, their sacred anvil, and we can start working with demonsteel again. "
4448,The Art of Demonsteel,Work with Muirn Ironhorn to craft a Demonsteel Bar. ,"The Firmament Stone is one of the few anvils beneath the sky that can tolerate the hammer strikes necessary to craft demonsteel. Here, I will show you. Two parts leystone, one part felslate. No heat, no tempering, just pure strength and finesse. Try it. I will coach you. "
4449,Strange New Ores,Obtain 10 Leystone Ore. ,"You smell that, smith? Ahhhh. . . that there's the smell of opportunity. Dalaran's taken us to some strange new shores, filled with mysterious metals. I'm tethered to my shop here, but you. . . you've got the freedom to explore and mine at will. Bring me something interesting, and we'll see what we can make with it. "
4450,Leystone Mastery,"Speak with Thala Steeltotem to purchase a Leystone Armor Stand, then hang all eight pieces of Leystone Armor on it. ","Smiths that seek access to the Firmament Stone must first prove complete mastery over leystone. Craft an entire set of Leystone Armor, then submit it to me for inspection. Thala can provide you with an armor stand. "
4451,Empyrial Strength,Craft an Empyrial Breastplate. ,"I see my armor's caught your interest. It's made from the finest material on Argus: empyrium. I actually specialize in crafting breastplates. I could show you how to craft one, but you'll need to bring your own supplies, I'm afraid. Our stores of the ore are low and we need all that we have. But here are the plans so you'll know what you need to find. . . "
4452,Gearing Redridge,Tormus Deepforge wants you to bring 4 Runed Copper Belts and 4 Heavy Copper Mauls to Verner Osgood in Redridge. ,"We dwarves aren't the only ones fighting.  Our human allies have their hands full too! Redridge is under periodic attack from blackrock orcs, and their supply of equipment is always low.  If you were to help them out, I'm sure their resident blacksmith, Verner Osgood, would teach you a trick or two. "
4453,Tribal Knowledge,Report back to Felsmith Nal'ryssa in Suramar. ,"First, however, you'll need proper patterns for demonsteel armor. While access to the stone is earned through hard work and perseverance, access to our recipes is limited to the trusted members of our tribe. Perhaps you should seek another smith if you wish to discuss demonsteel patterns. "
4454,Advanced Quenching,Craft a pair of Hard Leystone Armguards for Alard. ,"Now that we have a frost mage at our disposal, testing this method out should be a cinch. Here are the plans for what I'd like you to make. Get to work and give me the armguards when you're finished. "
4455,Demonsteel Armguards,"The armguards you've made are impressive, but you can provide the same level of protection without wasting so much raw material. ","The armguards you've made are impressive, but you can provide the same level of protection without wasting so much raw material. Here, let me show you. "
4456,The Properties of Leystone,Observe Alard as he attempts to work with the leystone ore. ,"I've never seen anything like this ""leystone"" ore. It's light, like mithril, but it carries much more of a magical energy. . . more even than saronite or elementium. Let's try making something with it. How about a nice pair of gauntlets? "
4457,Not Just Weapons and Armor,Craft 4 Hard Leystone Bars and 24 Hard Leystone Nails. ,"You know, we aren't just limited to armorsmithing and weaponsmithing. I regularly make chisels for the scribes, crucibles for the alchemists, and even thimbles for the tailors. They should sew in full plate gauntlets if they're really all that worried about their poor little thumbs. Anyhow, I have a recipe I think an adventurer like you might be interested in. Let's try it out. "
4458,Between the Hammer. . . ,Bring Saris' Hammer back to his shop. ,"<name>, I fear that my spirit will remain bound to this place unless I am made whole again. Long ago, I discovered a cave near the coast behind Black Rook Hold. I explored the cave only to find an abominable creature that attacked me, causing me to drop my hammer as I fled. I need that hammer back if I am to be at peace. "
4459,Hatecoil Hammerwork,Obtain a Masterwork Hatecoil Breastplate and a pair of Masterwork Hatecoil Pauldrons. ,"There may be a way to jump-start our research into leystone. I've heard reports of naga camps down in Azsuna. If they've been in Azsuna for long enough, their smiths have certainly started experimenting with leystone themselves. Be on the lookout for some leystone armor on the naga. . . ideally something more elaborate than a bracer. "
4460,Ironhorn Leysmithing,Gather scrap metal around the Ironhorn Enclave. ,"I sense great strength in you, yet you refuse to wield it. We Ironhorn use double the metal of any normal blacksmith to craft our wares. There is also a technique in how you hammer such quantities of leystone that I will instruct you on. Use our scrap metal and hammer out the pieces for a gauntlet. I will weld the pieces together when you are finished. "
4461,Chicken Scratch,Bring the Ancient Highborne Data Printout to Professor Pallin in Dalaran. ,"I think I have just the thing to extract the information from this core for you. <Timofey loads the core into the hopper of a clearly goblin-made machine, then covers his ears. >You may wish to avert your eyes, blacksmith. "
4462,Nature Provides,Obtain 10 Foxflower. ,"This is interesting, it says that leystone reacts violently with anything it views as a contaminant. Our foreign-mined flux was enough to cause the small explosion. Local ingredients, however, have learned to coexist with leystone. Up in Highmountain, an herb called foxflower grows that can be turned into a suitable flux. Go and gather some foxflower that we can turn into a usable flux. "
4463,Leysmithing Mastery,Follow Alard Schmied's recipes in your Blacksmithing recipe list to build some Handcrafted Leystone Gauntlets. ,"Well, now that we have the flux we can put it to work and see how it goes. Why don't you take a crack at it this time and make some gauntlets for me. I'll observe your work. . . from a distance. "
4464,Maw of Souls: Hammered By The Storm,Go to the Maw of Souls and recover an Ancient Vrykul Hammer. ,"Your hammer looks weak, and would probably break upon striking the Firmament Stone. The vrykul master blacksmiths of old were known for the strength of their hammers. The only way to get our hands on such a hammer would be to go where vrykul go when they die. To the Maw of Souls. The goddess that resides over that realm is named Helya. She hoards the trinkets they bring for her own desires. Defeat her and you may be able to acquire such a hammer. "
4465,Armor of the Ancients,Obtain 100 Ancient Demonsteel from humanoids in Broken Shore. ,"It is not just the hammers and my careful research that we need, <name>. We also need a lot of the very highest quality of ancient metal to make the final hammer. Enemies across Broken Shore that are able to wear armor often collect bits of Ancient Demonsteel here and there. Collect enough of it in your battles for our purposes. "
4466,Grayheft,"Obtain Grayheft, Ancient Hammer of the Highmountain Tauren from Kubrul within the Deep Roads cavern. ","Our tribe regularly crafts legplates out of leystone. I will share our pattern with you. . . if you do me a favor. My father fell to the drogbar several years ago, and they took his hammer as a trophy. That hammer was in my family for countless generations. Now, it languishes in the hands of the vile drogbar, Kubrul. I would very much like to have it back. "
4467,Joys of Omosh,Watch and learn the Omosh Dance of Joy. ,"Orokk is not crying, <name>. Soot is in eye. <Orokk wipes a tear away. >There is one last Omosh family secret Orokk will teach you. Orokk will die happy, thanks to <name>. Learn Omosh dance of joy and then you learn fist of iron! "
4468,Horns of Frenzy,"Bring two Solid Iron Mauls, two Silvered Bronze Boots, and two Silvered Bronze Gauntlets to Orokk Omosh in Orgrimmar. ","The final lesson Orokk teaches you, <name>. To the sacred anvil and forge you return! Bring for Orokk two solid iron mauls, two silvered bronze boots, and two silvered bronze gauntlets. See the fear in their eyes as you approach! "
4469,Demonsteel Waistguard,Excellent smithing. ,"Excellent smithing. Now, allow me to show you a trick I use to conserve resources. "
4470,Weigh Anchor,Bring the Crate of Felslate to Walcott Sutton at Stormwind Harbor. ,"<name>, I was hoping to ask you for a small favor. The naval fleet at Stormwind Harbor have been requesting large amounts of felslate to help construct supplies for their ships. I'm pretty busy here coordinating the gathering efforts and all my couriers are still out. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking that shipment over there to them? I heard there's a portal to Stormwind in the Greyfang Enclave here in Dalaran so it shouldn't be a long trip or anything. "
4471,A Familiar Axe to Grind,Show the axe blade to Hoddruc Bladebender at Chiselgrip. ,"The construction of this blade feels familiar, but you can't quite recall where you may have seen something like it before. Perhaps someone at Chiselgrip might know more about its construction. "
4472,You Are Not Worthy,Use your blacksmithing skill to craft a pair of Leystone Gauntlets for Barm. ,"You wish me to teach you how to strengthen your crafts? We do not simply share the secrets of our trade with outsiders who ask for them. We do, however, respect craftsmanship and discipline. Let's see your hammerwork. Our greenhorn trainees use those small anvils over there. Craft your best pair of gauntlets so I may judge your work. "
4473,Clearing the Air,"Recover a Cardinal Sky Core, a Cardinal Storm Core, and a Cardinal Wind Core for Lunelli. ","Ancient weapons require ancient offerings to regain the knowledge on how to construct them. If you wish to learn how weapons forged from air are crafted, then you must first battle with beings born from it. Bring me their cores and I will gift you the knowledge you seek. "
4474,Earth to Earth,"Recover a Cardinal Stone Core, a Cardinal Earth Core, and a Cardinal Lava Core for Lunelli. ","From the earth comes strength, and such strength can be imbued into weapons of power. You have the look of one who seeks to know how to create such weapons. There are creatures that still inhabit this dying planet who bear such strength. Bring me their cores and I shall trade you the knowledge you seek. "
4475,Demonsteel Breastplate,The amount of ore you're wasting on that pattern is simply unacceptable. ,"The amount of ore you're wasting on that pattern is simply unacceptable. We should conserve wherever possible: it's better for the land and easier on the pocket. Please, use this plan instead. "
4476,Leystone Hoofplates,Approach Mei Francis in Dalaran while mounted to have your Leystone Hoofplates fitted. ,"Here, bring these hoofplates to Mei Francis, down at the mounts and pets store, to get your mount properly shod. I'll share the pattern when you return. "
4477,Worthy of the Stone,Speak with Muirn Ironhorn. ,"You have nothing more to prove to me, <name>. Your training is complete. Only a very small herd of smiths have earned the right to the Firmament Stone. You should speak with Muirn Ironhorn, who maintains vigil over our sacred stone. He will tell you what to do next. "
4478,From One Master to Another,Go back to Alard in Dalaran and share what you've learned from the Tauren. ,"Now young one, go back to your masterin Dalaran and continue to practice your swing. We'll always be here if you wish to come back and learn more. "
4479,Blackrock Depths: Jewel of the Depths,"Travel to Blackrock Depths and obtain a Core of Bael'Gar, Core of Roccor, Essence of Incendius, and Essence of Magmus. ","Welcome to Everlook. Could I interest you in a new weapon of sorts? You know, I'm not just into selling weapons of mass dismemberment here at the shop. I like rare jewels as well. Perhaps you and I can come to an arrangement of sorts in procuring a jewel I've had my eye on getting for quite some time. I have some great blacksmithing plans here you might be interested in, you know, in trade for your services. Now, onto the details. . . "
4480,Engineers: Not COMPLETELY Useless,Bring the Ancient Sentry Construct Memory Core to Timofey Oshenko in Dalaran. ,"Unfortunately, I have no idea how to access any information within this core. But I know someone who does. Head over to ""Like Clockwork"", the engineering shop three doors down from here. Timofey Oshenko owes me a favor. He should be able to extract the memory out of the core. "
4481,Weapon No More,Bring the Badly Broken Dark Spear to Ko'Zan at Mossy Pile in Un'Goro Crater. ,The spear you found certainly has the makings of troll designs from other blacksmithing crafts. Perhaps somebody at one of the camps here in Un'Goro will know more about it. 
4482,Nal'ryssa's Technique,Obtain 60 Leystone Ore and 60 Felslate. ,"Listen, <class>. We need smiths like you to carry on the traditions of the Illidari, should we fail in our crusade against the Legion. You are ready to learn. Bring me materials. Lots of them. When you return, we will have much to discuss. "
4483,Demonsteel Pauldrons,"Your anvilwork is to be commended, but the recipe you're using is unnecessarily wasteful. ","Your anvilwork is to be commended, but the recipe you're using is unnecessarily wasteful. Try this instead. "
4484,Hammer of Forgotten Heroes,Go to the Firmament Stone in Highmountain and forge the Hammer of Forgotten Heroes. ,"<name>, this is exciting, I have to admit. I've put everything you've gathered into this chest of supplies and the only place with the power and magic to handle the creation of the final hammer is the Firmament Stone. I believe that blacksmiths of your rarified skills will know it? I realize that there are dwarf stereotypes out there about smithing but I really don't care for all of the banging and heat. Suppose that is why I followed the scholarly path. Good luck to you! "
4485,Smith Under Fire,Follow Felsmith Nal'ryssa's instructions to craft Leystone Boots. ,"You lack recipes for boots? What, were you trained by a tauren or something? Hurry up, then. We probably have a few minutes before the demons attack again. Here's a pattern - show me your work. "
4486,The Highmountain Smiths,Speak with Barm Stonebreaker in Highmountain. ,"I think we've gone as far as we can go with what I know, <name>. The tauren of Highmountain must have some smiths among their ranks. See if you can find out how to further progress our leysmithing abilities from them. "
4487,Part of the Team,Slay 40 demons within Felsoul Hold. ,"You're a blacksmith? <The elf looks down at your hammer. >Still working in leystone, are you? I might be able to help you out. Alliances out here are hard-won. You've got a pretty face, but that's no guarantee that you aren't working for the demons. I can't afford to trust you yet. Don't come back until you're caked in demon's blood. Then we'll talk smithing. "
4488,Therazane's Choice,Listen to Therazane's proposition. ,<You explain that you meant no disrespect to Therazane or to steal their secrets. >Interesting. . . I have a wonderful idea on how to solve this issue. Would you like to hear it? 
4489,The Methods of the Nightfallen,Obtain an Ancient Sentry Construct Memory Core. ,"I have a theory, <name>. Have you encountered the nightfallen elves of Azsuna? They descend from the Highborne, and the accomplishments of Highborne smiths are legendary. These fallen elves do a bit of arcane tinkering, crafting sentries to patrol their camps. Bring me a memory core from one of their constructs. Who knows what manner of smithlore might lie within! "
4490,Secrets of Leysmithing,Bring the Leysmithing Guide to Alard Schmied in Dalaran. ,"I could spend hours poring over the details of this fascinating manuscript! . . . is what I would say if this weren't the simplest of tasks for someone of my skill level. It's about something called ""Leysmithing"". Here. <The gnome scribbles down a translation on the back of the scroll. >There it is, word-for-word. Bring me something interesting next time. "
4491,Felsmith Nal'ryssa,Report to Felsmith Nal'ryssa in Suramar. ,"Word has been circulating in smithing circles about a pair of Illidari blacksmiths that have been doing exciting work out on the demon-infested front lines of Suramar. I'd follow up myself, but anything described as ""demon-infested"" is a little too exotic for my tastes. I just make the armor. I prefer not to wear it. You, though. . . you could follow up on this tip. Be on the lookout for Nal'ryssa. From what I hear, she's a hell of a smith. "
4492,The Dragonhunter,Defeat Dargul in Neltharion's Lair in Mythic difficulty and create a hammer from his Red-Hot Draconic Slag. ,"The Dragonhunter lived in a time before history was was written and her tale was passed down orally to us. It seems that dragons tormented her people and after her village temple was destroyed, she rallied the local tribes, became a queen and killed all of the dragons. She was then banished for some reason and wandered until her death, alone. What proves the story is a piece of draconic slag from left over from a metal idol in her birth village. Dargul the Underking has it now. Forge a hammer from it. "
4493,Barbaric Battlements,"Bring two Patterned Bronze Bracers, two Bronze Greatswords, and two Sharp Claws to Orokk Omosh in Orgrimmar. ","Twenty generations of Omosh have held this hammer, <name>. A hundred thousand tons of metal we have molded. Tragically, it all ends at Orokk, failure of the Omosh: Without kin and incapable of producing offspring. I cannot let the secret recipes of Omosh die with me! Someone must continue the legacy, Omosh or not! Prove to Orokk you are capable, <name>. Bring for Orokk the following: Two patterned bronze bracers, two bronze greatswords, and two sharp claws. Bring them for Orokk and we shall continue. "
4494,Leystone's Potential,Use Felsmith Nal'ryssa's technique to craft a set of Masterwork Leystone Armguards. ,"As I'm sure you've deduced, all of the leystone recipes you know can be improved. By learning to harness leystone's true potential, you can reduce the amount of material you use and still yield an equivalent result. Here, I'll show you. We'll start, as one does, with the humble bracer. This particular piece of armor benefits from the addition of brimstone runes. See for yourself. "
4495,Deep In the Core,Travel to Orgrimmar and take the portal to Deepholm. ,"Look, ya gonna have ta travel ta Deepholm and convince dem ta be givin' up deir secrets. Dat's where da last anvil was made, or so I be hearin'. And I only be knowin' of one earten down dere who might be willin' ta work wit ya. His name be Ormhun Stonehamma'. He be kind of an outcast, but not too hard ta find. "
4496,The Hellslayer,Defeat Helya and forge a hammer from the Frostveined Shale in the Trial of Valor. ,The Hellslayer's tale is a classic story of revenge. Odyn wished to take the souls of the bravest as champions but Helya sent her kvaldir to take the souls first. The people of Stormheim suffered as their pawns. The kvaldir came to the Hellslayer's ship at night and killed her son and took his soul to serve Helya for eternity. The Hellslayer took up her axe and the spear of her son and sought vengeance. Finish her quest. Defeat Helya and forge a hammer from the Frostveined Shale. 
4497,Demonsteel Greaves,"Now that you've done it the easy way, try this. ","Now that you've done it the easy way, try this. It's more difficult, but it will save you loads of materials. "
4498,Flower-Pickers and Potion-Quaffers,Speak with Linzy Blackbolt and Kuhuine Tenderstride to secure a work order for Foxflower Flux. ,"Now that we know the foxflower flux is safe to use, we can start stocking it. That being said, I don't particularly feel like picking flowers. Do you feel like picking flowers? Didn't think so. Go talk to the alchemists and herbalists across the way. I'm sure we can set up some sort of work order arrangement. "
4499,. . . And the Anvil,Gather 5 Black Rook Breastplates from the elves of Black Rook Hold. ,"If you truly wish to see my work then you'll have to go and retrieve it as my shop has been raided of everything I've made. The breastplates of the Black Rook soldiers were one of my greatest accomplishments. They're light, yet strong and offer great mobilityRelinquish my cursed brethren of their breastplates and bring them back to me. I will explain the finer points of how I made them upon your return. "
4500,Legend of Black Rook Hold,Go to Black Rook Hold and search for Saris Swifthammer. ,"<name>, have you heard of Saris Swifthammer? He was a legendary blacksmith amongst the elves of Black Rook Hold. I wonder if any of his research still exists. I want you to travel there and see if you can discover anything about Saris, or see if he left anything we can research here at my shop. "
4501,A Recipe For the Ages,Bring Grix Barlow back 30 pieces of Revlis Ore from Gol Koval in Drustvar. ,"Yo, <name>, over here! You've look like you've been hammering away for a while. I can smell the flux on ya! <Grix gives you a wide grin. >Listen, I've got a recipe for the most amazing blacksmith hammer you've ever laid your eyes on. And I'd be willing to let it go for a bit of ore. Revlis ore to be exact. It's a little rare, but you can find plenty of it over in Gol Koval in Drustvar. The elementals there are practically made of it. Bring me back a haul of it, and the recipe's yours! "
4502,Demonsteel Boots,"We don't tend to smith many boots up here, but even I can tell that you're using too much metal for the sole. ","We don't tend to smith many boots up here, but even I can tell that you're using too much metal for the sole. Here's a way to cut back on your resource costs. "
4503,A Sweet Bargain,Find a frost mage in Dalaran to chill your quenching trough. ,"Reading over this research, I found an interesting method that I'd like you to try. The method would require us to chill the metal to sub-freezing temperatures during the pre-tempering phase. Simple water quenching won't do. Good thing you can't walk two steps in this city without bumping into a frost mage! See if you can recruit one for the shop, <name>. "
4504,Reverse Blacksmithing,Deconstruct the Broken Darkspear. ,"And 'ere I thought I'd never see dis ting again! Although, it don't look like it used to. Aw mon, I'm gonna be in big trouble if I show up wit dis in my hand. Do ya tink you could help me fix it? I don't have da plans for it, cause you see, da first night I spent here, da creatures came up and stole all me tings. But whadd'ya say? Help a bruddah out? I tink if you can figure out what it's made from, den you can fix it and I can write down da details on how it's made. "
4505,The Legend of the Four Hammers,Go to Dalaran and find the Legend of the Four Hammers. ,"<name>, we should be honest with each other before we begin. You are a blacksmith by trade and this a noble profession. Yet I value style and fashion. Heavy armor and weapons create a certain bulkiness in a hero's profile that I think does no service whatsoever to the cut of one's clothes. Fret not--I can at least teach you something about taste in finer materials. Go to Dalaran and find a book translated by my brother about 3 forgotten heroes.

4665,Cloaked in Tradition,Take Guron's Journal to Nalthanis in Dalaran. ,"You have seen the ways of the tauren of Thunder Totem. . . speaking with the spirits, gathering from the land, and letting nothing go to waste. These are potent forces crucial to your quest to aid the Broken Isles. Here, take this journal back to your enchanter friend. It contains the lessons I have imparted unto you. Perhaps it will serve to help the greater cause of defeating the Legion. "
4666,On Azure Wings,Speak to the dragon Kharmeera at Azurewing Repose in Azsuna. ,"I have some exciting news of my own to report, <name>. Ildine and I had an excursion to Azsuna and made contact with the blue dragons at the Azurewing Repose. One of the dragons, Kharmeera, is an enchanter who expressed interest in working with you to perfect some of our enchantments. I understand you were just down there working with the elves, but if you wouldn't mind returning, Kharmeera would enjoy working with you too. "
4667,Turnabout Betrayal,Defeat demons at the Felblaze Ingress. ,"Enchantress Ilanya remembers me? <The satyr pauses to wipe a tear away. >I made a fool's bargain ten millennia ago. I learned of the queen's alliance with the Legion and betrayed my heart to join their side. I was transformed into a monstrosity, only to die in battle against the mortals. Now the Legion returns, but I linger as an impotent spirit. Be my vessel and slay the demons ahead of us. Take their demonic runes and render them to dust. "
4668,Sentinel's Final Duty,Slay Fathom-Commander Eksis. ,"Now that I'm stronger, it's time to test your mettle, and mine. As I mentioned earlier, there is a powerful naga I wish to kill. His name is Fathom-Commander Eksis. He was responsible for slaying many of my kin before he retreated into hiding, commanding his troops from the shadows. I've finally discovered his whereabouts in a cave just east of here. Let us bring vengeance upon him for my lost brothers and sisters. "
4669,Crossroads Rendezvous,Search for signs of the priestess near the Felblaze Ingress. ,"An old apprentice of mine left during the war, shortly before we were all cursed. I've recently heard that she's been seen near the Felblaze Ingress. I would very much like to speak to her once more. Go and find her. Take her journal to her and let her know that I don't blame her for what she did. And if she's willing, please bring her back to me. "
4670,Washed Clean,Meet the Fallen Priestess at the Nor'Danil Wellspring. ,"Mighty though the Legion is, theirs is not the strongest power in Azeroth. There is a place where Enchantress Ilanya and I spent many blissful hours together. The love that infuses such a place is more potent than fel magic, <name>. Go to the Nor'Danil Wellspring. Its waters can purify the fel dust you have collected. . . and perhaps purify me as well. I will meet you there. "
4671,Prepping For Battle,"Craft an Enchant Cloak - Word of Strength vellum, an Enchant Ring - Word of Critical Strike vellum and an Enchant Ring - Word of Mastery vellum for Alynblaze. ","To earn my mark, <class>, you must first prove yourself in battle to me. There is a naga I wish to kill, but I am not strong enough to slay him. Before we go into battle together, I need your help as an enchanter to become stronger. I'm sure by now you have a bevy of enchantments in your repertoire. Make some for me so that I may become strong enough again to make a difference in this world. "
4672,Pick Up Sticks,Collect 9 Bundles of Hard Wood. ,"In order for my enchantment to work, we'll need wood from these forests.

When I was alive, I would wander these woods and tend to the trees. While those trees are long gone, perhaps their grandseeds have heard their stories and would be willing to help me.

But don't cut down any of the trees! Please! There are loggers that cut and hew without care for the wilds. Take their hard work so that they will think twice before felling another tree.

Bring me as much wood as you can muster. "
4673,No Longer Worthy,Kill night elves within the grounds of Black Rook Hold and collect their Enchanted Raven Sigils. ,"The elves of Black Rook Hold have decided to turn their backs on us. They stay inside their keep, attacking any outsider who dare try to enter. Such behavior is intolerable. . . especially after all the help they've received from my folk and the others of this land. I want you to do me a favor, <name>. Take their enchanted sigils and reduce them to dust. Bring me back the dust as proof of your deeds. "
4674,Putting It All Together,Assemble the golem for Sef Iwen. ,"Hmm. . . Everything seems untouched.

We can begin construction of my new body over here. Afterwards, I'll teach you how to make my enchanting rod.

<Sef smiles at you, beaming with joy. >"
4675,A Voice on the Wind,Seek out the source of the mysterious voice in Drustvar. ,"<A distant, mysterious voice fills your mind. >

My enchantments are not lost. . .

Find me. . .

Drustvar. . .

Fallhaven. . . "
4676,Fey Enchantments,Seek out Nalamya near the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah. ,"The new dusts and crystals we've found in these lands are fascinating, as I'm sure you've already surmised. I'm positive we can expand their usefulness to more of our armor. I'd like you to go back out into the field and talk to a dryad in Val'sharah. Apparently she may be able to clue us into some enchantments for shoulder pieces. Her name is Nalamya. You'll find her near the Temple of Elune. "
4677,We're Going In,Activate the teleportation runes to enter Sef's Retreat. ,"This used to be a Drust shrine. There is a series of sigils that, once invoked, will allow us to teleport to my old sanctum.

<Sef looks around somewhat confused and clears her throat. >

It has been centuries since I've been here, I'm having a bit of trouble remembering the order in which the sigils need to be activated to open the portal.

I hope you're feeling adventurous. Oh, and be cautious. I enchanted the runes to keep would be intruders out by force. "
4678,The Beat Goes On,Create a runic power core and charge it from the corpses of Awoken Guardians and Vengeful Bones. ,"We have most of the materials we need, but we require one final item. A heart.

Don't worry. I don't mean one of flesh, but of stone; to bind the materials of the body into a single form.

Find a smooth stone, and enchant it to hold a life force. It will require some reagents, but I would expect a powerful enchanter such as yourself to have some on hand or know where to find them.

Once that's done, it will need to be powered. The souls animating the elementals and undead here should do the trick. "
4679,Exhumed,Cleanse Sef Iwen's remains. ,"As I've said, I'm unable to interact with the material world.

I am able to dominate a creature to control its body, but I find it deplorable. In essence, it is enslaving the poor creature.

What I want is a body of my own. If you build and animate a golem, it would be devoid of intelligence. A shell. One that I could inhabit without issue.

Doing so will require that my soul is not anchored to anything else in this world, so I need you to remove the spell binding my spirit to my physical remains. "
4680,Enchanted Formulae,"Hey, &lt; name&gt; . ","Hey, <name>. I've got some new recipes for ya, if you're interested. "
4681,What the Drust Knew,Carefully remove the enchantment from the Ancient Drust relic to learn about its construction. ,"Bal'a dash, <name>.

If you have a moment, I could use your assistance. I've recently received a shipment of Drust relics that were smuggled out of Kul Tiras.

Most have our usual enchantments, but there is one that is unique. Just holding it makes my hair stand on end. 

With you being my best pupil, I was thinking that it would be enlightening if we disenchanted it together, to see how it was made.

What do you say? "
4682,The Threads That Bind,Collect 55 Durable Spider Silk. ,"Our destination is near Gol Koval, but there is something else you could pick up along the way.

I don't want to ask because I hate them, but you cannot dispute the resilience of that horrible webbing that they manage to get everywhere.

<Sef grimaces at the thought. >

There are spiders to the southeast. As a guardian of nature, I don't want to say kill them, but if you could. . . 'obtain' some fresh silk from their bodies, we could use it to bind the limbs of the golem together. "
4683,The Sixth Sense,Escort Sef Iwen to her grave. ,"For my plan to work, we need to break the spell on my body that is anchoring my spirit to this place.

However, my mortal remains are buried deep within this forest. There are wards within it that are designed to trap spirits who are still attached to the material world. Once my remains are cleansed, I will be able to move freely through the woods.

Until then, I'll need you to disenchant the wards we come across.

Speak to me when you are ready, and I will lead you to my grave. "

Here, take this and get some readings for me, will ya? "
4693,Short Circuit,Find the inventor of Blingtron. ,"While I've got you here, I was wondering if you could track something down for me. I'm sure you're familiar with a Blingtron, yes?

But first, you gotta be able to suck it up, and that, my friend, requires a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor. Now, I could just give you the schematics, but I'll need something in return first.  How about some spare parts?  Last time I checked, there were plenty lying around near the broken steam pump at the Dead Mire, far to the northeast. I heard that the withered giants spread the pieces all over that dried-out lake bed. "
4695,The Wrench Calls,Meet with Didi the Wrench in Dalaran. ,"<name>, Didi the Wrench is looking for you back in Dalaran. You might want to see what she's working on. Pretty fancy stuff from what I heard. "

4697,The Zapthrottle Mote Extractor! ,Bring 15 Steam Pump Parts to K. ,"Have you seen the swamp gas?  Isn't it just shiny? It takes a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor to suck 'em dry though.  I could give you the plans to make one, but I really need some spare parts to fix stuff 'round here. Last time I checked, there were plenty of parts lying around near the steam pump at the Dead Mire to the northeast.  I think the withered giants broke the pump out there. Shall we help each other out? "
4698,Always the Last Thing,Find a suitable power source for Didi's design and deliver it to her. ,"Well, I've worked out all the kinks. Added a few nuts and bolts, and fitted a new housing for the power core. Problem is, none of the batteries I have here seem to work. I think we're gonna have to fashion somethin' new together.

4701,A Harsh Mistress,Help Hobart calibrate the Prototype Gravitational Reduction Slippers around Dalaran. ,"So there I was thinkin' about how to get everyone ready for movin' around Argul or whatever it's called, since I figure its gravity is different than ours, and I come up with a design for a device you slip onto your shoes, or hooves or whatever you're wearin' down there. Next thing I hear, the gravity on that planet? Completely the same as ours! Regardless, I figure I could get the prototype workin'. Mind givin' me a hand? Maybe when we're done you can like, sell 'em to kids or somethin'. "
4702,Modular Modifications,Create a Reaves Module: Snack Distribution Mode. ,"Now that we got this baby running, let's give it some cool abilities.

4773,Bait Bandits,Bring a Blackfin Darter to Old Man Barlo. ,"You probably know all about the golden darter--they're fairly common in the rivers of Terokkar Forest and a delicacy for priests.  But here's one you haven't heard of: the blackfin darter. The fish is notoriously crafty and difficult to catch.

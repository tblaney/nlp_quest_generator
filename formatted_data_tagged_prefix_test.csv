"Name: The Zapthrottle Mote Extractor! , Objective: Bring 15 Steam Pump Parts to K.  ","Have you seen the swamp gas?  Isn't it just shiny? It takes a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor to suck 'em dry though.  I could give you the plans to make one, but I really need some spare parts to fix stuff 'round here. Last time I checked, there were plenty of parts lying around near the steam pump at the Dead Mire to the northeast.  I think the withered giants broke the pump out there.

Many of the pilgrims who have journeyed to the Catalyst Wards have not returned. This includes Feroz, who is most likely to have information we need to restore the remnants.

"Name: Who Wards The Greenwarden, Objective: Talk to Ferilon Leafborn at Greenwarden's Grove in the Wetlands.  ","The greenwarden was a local legend. Many thought him a myth. . . the plant-man, protector of the wetlands. The night elves came here just to find him, and after they succeeded they ended up settling down to the east. They've got a whole grove over there to watch over the greenwarden, and I've heard he's been acting up, enraged by the flooding and damage to the land. The elves are good people. They could use the help of someone like you. If you get a chance, go tell the head druid what you've done here. "
"Name: The Scarlet Oracle, Demetria, Objective: The Scarlet Oracle, Demetria is the finale of the Nathanos questline that is begun by speaking to Nathanos Blightcaller in the Eastern Plaguelands.  ","Demetria is chief advisor to the Grand Crusader. She is called the Oracle due to her 'otherworldly' senses.

"Name: Missing Friends, Objective: Ethan wants you to find 12 of his missing friends in Veil Skith and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan.  ",We broke down here because some guys came in the night and made a lot of noise.  It was scary.  I don't know when we are going to get moving again. Some of my friends are missing though.  I don't know where they are.  I think those scary bird men took them away to the northwest.  They probably are all locked up in cages and stuff.  If you find them that would be great.  I'm kind of worried about them. 
"Name: Garrison Campaign: The Ring of Blood, Objective: Speak to Gurgthock at Gurgthock's Stash in Nagrand.  ","Hey Champ, You were out when I stopped by. You're the talk of the arena, friend!

"Name: Culling the Corrupted, Objective: Collect 10 Corrupted Pelts from Angerclaw Bears or Felpaw Wolves.  ","The sickening corruption of demons pervades this entire forest. The soil, the trees, the animals. . . all grow thick with fel magics. We of the Emerald Circle have sworn to cleanse this forest, and doing so requires a constant battle.

Hunt the bears and wolves, and return to me with their hides. "
"Name: Spread the Word, Objective: Speak with Fizzle Brassbolts on Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge in Thousand Needles.  ","For rendering me faithful service, I grant you your life.

"Name: Securing the Bait, Objective: Bring 6 Primordial Hatchlings to Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost.  ","We're not likely to get Broodmother Slivina's attention waving our arms around like fools, but if we're smart, we can bait her into fighting us. We'll also secure more, uh, fodder for my little project. <Dorian glances over at Zootfizzle. >But don't worry about that for now. Just look for the primordial drake eggs in the area east and northeast of the camp. Burst them open and scoop up the hatchlings that come out. When the broodmother realizes what we've done, she'll have no choice but to face us. "
"Name: Rest For the Weary, Objective: Speak with Captain Taylor.  ","You have done well, <race>, but there is much more to do and I grow weary. I have expended a great deal of energy sending a distress message to Earthen Ring leadership, pleading for their help. I must rest if I am to be of further use to us here.

"Name: Fragments of the Abyss, Objective: Collect $1oa &lt; PH SHADOW CRYSTAL THINGS&gt; from Rare Elites on Argus.  ","Our scouts have delivered a disturbing report, champion. Some of the more powerful creatures of the Void are carrying powerful crystals that augment their abilities. They now pose a greater threat than before, and we can no longer ignore them.

"Name: Plants of Zangarmarsh, Objective: Bring 10 Unidentified Plant Parts to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.  ","The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water.  We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct. As the expedition's cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them. If you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts.  They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them. "
"Name: MacKreel's Moonshine, Objective: Take MacKreel's Moonshine to Brewmeister Bilger in Southshore.  ","Had quite a bit of the ol' Moonshine last night!  Longbraid would have my head if he knew that I passed out during my watch. The noggin hurts something fierce.  Felt as though a whole brigade of siege engines passed overhead, all that rumbling. Oh my, look at the time! I promised Brewmeister Bilger in Southshore that I'd repay my debt to him by sending some Moonshine. But there are just 15 minutes left before I'm overdue!

That's right.  You're going to skin the monster. "
"Name: The Threat of Flame, Objective: Kill 8 Rampant Fire Elementals.  ","Flame has threatened me for far too long. . . far too long. . . but it is no longer the little ones, no longer mere gnats. . . The fields burn! The hills and highlands scream, <race>, they scream. The elementals brought here consume all life in their wake. They cannot stand, they cannot stand. Stop them. STOP THEM! Destroy the bringers of flame. . . "
"Name: Grunt Work, Objective: Vigorously polish 7 pairs of Blackrock Boots.  ","Bah!  You're lucky I'm short-handed today.  Otherwise I'd make you my personal whipping <boy/girl> for the week.

"Name: Damned Intruders, Objective: Kill 6 Cultists and 4 Bloodthirsty Ghouls at the Crossroads.  ","It is imperative that these reports reach Commander Throgg, but we are hard-pressed to defend the Crossroads.

"Name: Torch Tossing, Objective: Win the torch tossing game, then speak with the Master Flame Eater.  ","So you want to be a fire juggler?  Do you have what it takes?  The dexterity?  The reflexes? . . . the courage?  If you think so, then let's give you a little practice! Take these torches and run near the bonfire.  You'll see  braziers with markers flashing above them.

"Name: The Search Continues, Objective: Search for the Menethil Statuette.  ","You thoroughly search this cluster of murloc hovels, and find no trace of the Menethil statuette. Perhaps one of the two nearby hovels to the north and northeast will have more clues. "
"Name: Find a Rumble Coin, Objective: Find an Rumble Coin in Stormwind Harbor and insert it into the Warcraft Rumble machine.  ","To use this game machine, you need a Rumble Coin.

There are a bunch of coins hidden all around the Dragon Isles. We'll chat about those later.

Insert that Rumble Coin into the Rumble machine and watch the fun begin! "
"Name: Checking on the Boys, Objective: Travel to the Wetlands and speak to Mountaineer Rharen near Dun Algaz.  ","I'm sure you've seen just how bad the damage to the Loch is by now. The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands. There's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands. I haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them? "
"Name: To Give One's Heart, Objective: Craft a Heart in a Bottle |A: Professions-Icon-Quality-Tier3-Small: 20: 20|a with any crafting profession.  ","Now that we have the elemental essence gathered, do you think you could put them in this bottle?

"Name: Something Stinks, Objective: Use Snagglebolt's Air Analyzer to test the air around 6 heavily perfumed guards, then return to Inspector Snip Snagglebolt in Stormwind.  ","Get a load of these guys, would ya? Steamwheedle's been handling the business of holidays for years, and all of a sudden, these guys bust into the market. They're not Steamwheedle; the cartel hired me to get to the bottom of this. Something stinks here and it ain't just perfume.

Take this device I brought and go analyze the perfume clouds around the guards. I want to know what they're putting in that stuff. Things ain't natural. "
"Name: Can't Get Enough Turkey, Objective: Bring 20 Slow-Roasted Turkeys to Caitrin Ironkettle outside Ironforge.  ","I've been cooking nonstop since before the start of the holiday, and I still can't keep up with the demand. I don't suppose I could persuade you to help with one of the dishes, could I? Turkey is hard to come by here, so if you could supply some slow-roasted turkeys, it would be a big help. If you intend to prepare them yourself, you can hunt fresh wild turkeys anywhere in Elwynn Forest. You should be able to buy everything else you need from any of the Pilgrim's Bounty vendors. "
"Name: Masked Orphan Matron, Objective: Speak with a Masked Orphan Matron in either Razor Hill, Brill or Falconwing Square.  ","For Hallow's End, several orphans were taken on a trip to different Horde villages.  The orphan matrons thought it would be good for them to see real heroes adventuring in the field. Why don't you visit them?  A brave <class> like yourself could strengthen their spirits with tales of your valor!  Go to either Razor Hill in Durotar, Brill in Tirisfal Glades or Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.  Speak with the masked orphan matron and she'll introduce you to the children. "
"Name: The Vainglorious, Objective: Dispatch of Queen Azshara.  ","Queen Azshara and her royal guard lie ahead of us. We cannot afford the possibility of any interference with our plan. So we will take the fight to her, before she has a chance to meddle. It is quite unlikely that you will kill Queen Azshara today; very few coherent timelines exist along that branch. Consider it a victory if you are simply able to occupy her attention, however temporarily. "
"Name: The Kirin Tor, Objective: Use the Portal to the Purple Parlor in Lion's Landing and meet with Anduin Wrynn.  ","$p, King Varian has asked that I send you after his son to Dalaran. He believes you can help negotiate the withdrawal of blood elves there. These ""Sunreavers"" claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort. Now that our very own Jaina Proudmoore is in charge of the Kirin Tor it should be easy to convince her to remove this Horde threat to her city. Use the portal here in Lion's Landing to go to the Purple Parlor and lend what aid you can to Prince Anduin. "
"Name: Omens and Incense, Objective: Collect 5 Sweetsuckle Blooms, grind them into Sweetsuckle Incense, then aid Ohn Seshteng in the ritual.  ","I shared with Tigari Khan the omen we received before entering Maruukai. She expressed her concern, as the wind felt cold to her as well.

We cultivate certain flowers here, blooms that can be ground and burned to elicit a trancelike effect. They are used to deepen our connection to an omen. 

I request that you collect some so that we may make an incense to burn. With my khan's help, perhaps we can learn more of Ohn'ahra's plight. "
"Name: Descent into Darkness, Objective: Bring Mikhail's Journal to Lieutenant Dumont in Amberpine Lodge.  ","The journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail.  It details the arrival of a shadow-worshipping group called the ""wolfcult. ""The villagers were reluctant to embrace the cult at first, but sympathizers sprung up gradually among town residents.

"Name: The Spearcrafter's Hammer, Objective: Search Tor'Watha to the southeast of the Farstrider Retreat for Spearcrafter Otembe and bring Otembe's Hammer to Arathel Sunforge at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods.  ","The Amani and the sin'dorei have a long history of mutual dislike and open hostility.  That doesn't prevent me from appreciating a fellow craftsman's work, <name>. I've come across pieces of Amani weaponry and I must admit I'm impressed by the quality of their work.  It is rumored that Spearcrafter Otembe wields a magical hammer that is so light and well-balanced it allows him to work with great dexterity and efficiency. If you bring me this tool I'll use it to craft you a weapon. "
"Name: Forbidden Rites, Objective: Kill 15 K'thir and disrupt 6 rituals.  ","These k'thir have been hiding among us, sowing the seeds of their dark masters with us none the wiser.

"Name: Assisting Arch Druid Runetotem, Objective: Speak with Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem in Thunder Bluff.  ","Excuse me <class>, but I'd like just a moment of your time if possible.

Please - if you are interested, speak with him directly on the Elder Rise within Thunder Bluff proper. "
"Name: Garrison Campaign: Seismic Matters, Objective: Speak with Jr.  ",One of our junior surveyors has been harassing me about unusual seismic activity. I find it hard to believe that we accidentally built on some kind of fault line - we triple checked! Can you have a word with him? 
"Name: Nespirah, Objective: Enter Nespirah's northwestern entrance, then find a way to communicate with it.  ","It is clear to me at this point what must be done, <name>. The naga can only be obtaining these pearls from one place: Nespirah, the ancient, shelled creature that rests outside of this cave.  Why Nespirah would submit to the naga, however, is beyond my understanding. We can enter Nespirah's body cavity through a small tube near the exit to this cave.  I must first fetch my master, then we can meet you on the inside.  We will convene in Nespirah's northwestern entrance. "
"Name: The Stockade Riots, Objective: Kill Bazil Thredd and bring his head back to Warden Thelwater at the Stockade.  ","Let's get one thing straight, <name>: I don't trust you. But, with the situation as it is, you probably won't make a difference. So here's how it's going to be: go down there and have your talk with Thredd. If you're really on our side, then kill him and bring me his head when the job's done. And if it turns out you're on his side, and don't come out. . . when we find you, you'll die along with the rest of the maggots. "
"Name: Rats! , Objective: Go into the Underbelly and recover 3 Highmountain Leatherworking Patterns.  ","I tell you, <name>, I have the worst luck sometimes.

Gnoll activity in the area has tripled in the past two weeks. I fear they might be mounting up to make an assault on Lakeshire. I need you to head to each of the gnoll camps of this area and gather any information that you come across. Check the camps directly north of here, east of here and southeast of here. Bring back whatever you find. "
"Name: Protecting Our Rear, Objective: Kill Jarroc Torn-wing, Shahandana, and Gomegaz.  ","The only reason you see me standing aside Alliance soldiers is because our duty outweighs our enmity. . . however slightly.  We have been charged with protecting the Dark Portal from unauthorized travel, and with the recent cataclysm, we are particularly susceptible to an attack.  We've already heard reports of black dragons in the area. . . With my men focused on their duty, we need someone to keep the area demons in check.  Around the portal you will find three demon lieutenants.  Slay them. "

I hear the cries of the fallen echo across Northrend - calling to me. Arthas left a terrible imprint on everything he touched. Only wither and decay remains in his wake. It is important, then, for us to study the past so that we may better know our enemy. Perhaps untold truths shall surface that could help in our campaign. First, you must recover my scrying orb from the town hall, <name>. Exit this tower and turn left down the path to reach the town square. "
"Name: Warding the Warriors, Objective: Sorceress Kaylana at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 sets of Imbued Horde Armor from Horde players at the Glacial Falls.  ","<name>, good to see you. While the battle has subsided for now, we must hurry and replenish our stocks.

Head to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me. If you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals. "

"Name: Arnak Fireblade, Objective: Bring an Example Collar to Arnak Fireblade in Orgrimmar.  ","The Searing Collars you brought me are powerful demonic implements.  Divining their origin is, I'm afraid, beyond my skills as a shaman.  We will need a warlock to study them. Take a searing collar to Arnak Fireblade.

"Name: Borrowed Bombs, Objective: Collect 8 Irontree Explosives from Irontree Cavern.  ","The workers in Irontree Cavern below us have been driven out already. Something else has overtaken the cave.

Perhaps MOTHER can glean more information from Wrathion's journal. "
"Name: Touring the Front, Objective: Report to Foreman Tully, Lumbering Leo, and Grayson Bell.  ","The Horde haven't attacked for a while now. Neither have we, honestly. It should be safe to head on out and do some scouting.

Check in with our foremen at the mine and the lumber mill. It'd be good to know that they haven't off and gotten themselves killed, and the trip should give you a bit of a lay of the land.

Speaking of which, you might also talk to Grayson Bell, the flight master, who can give you a quick look at our enemy's base. ""Ar'gorok, "" or some other such orcish nonsense. "
"Name: The Skybreaker, Objective: Seek out High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker flying above Icecrown.  ","We were neck deep in Scourge and Horde.

"Name: More Anchor Pods, Objective: Harvest 9 Mature Anchor Pods from anchor weed.  ","Everyone in Kul Tiras knows that anchor weed is a blight that was brought here by merchants. It thrives in this weather and it leechs nutrients from other plants, so we work to keep it from spreading, but it also has a strong magical essence, keeping us from just eradicating it.

This time, however, a strange grinding noise is heard from inside the discs. Your backpack suddenly becomes heavier than it was before.  Inside, you discover a miniature version of the discs! No doubt, an item of this sort would be invaluable for someone interested in the ancient history of Azeroth.  Someone would sure be interested in this! "
"Name: Smoke, Meat, and Pretty Flowers, Objective: Obtain some Salted Venison Jerky, Grimm's Special Pipe Blend, and a Marigold Bouquet.  ","Back of town's on lockdown, kid. And yes, I do have a key, but you're a stranger. <Emery pats his pocket gingerly. >Listen, I'd like to help you out. You've got an honest look to you.

"Name: The Gordok Ogre Suit, Objective: Bring 4 Bolts of Runecloth, 8 Rugged Leather, 2 Rune Threads, and Ogre Tannin to Knot Thimblejack.  ","If you're going to fight the king of this dump - and I think that's what you're bound to do - then you're going to need to get by Captain Kromcrush.  Now, you can get by him by killing him, sure.  You might actually want to leave him alive. How, you ask?  Since I've been here, I think I know how to make an ogre suit that will last just long enough to fool these bozos.  The only problem is stability - ten minutes tops.  Bring me what I need, and I'll make you one.  I'm not going anywhere. . . "
"Name: The Final Judgment, Objective: Defeat Runeseer Faljar in Haustvald.  ","In my fragmented state, I captured glimpses of a hero meting out justice to the corrupted mystics of Haustvald. I see now, this hero was you, <class>. 

I know you seek my judgment, but my spirit is still fragmented. As we speak,  Runeseer Faljar is calling upon dark, forbidden magics in an attempt to banish my spirit to Helheim. If he succeeds, your trial will be lost.

My connection here is fading. Go, there is little time! "
"Name: Irondeep Supplies, Objective: Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the Horde Quartermaster in Frostwolf Keep.  ","The Stormpike dwarves are using the Irondeep mine as a storage depot.  I want you to raid that mine and bring me its supplies.  This will curtail the Stormpikes' efforts in Alterac Valley, and will provide us with needed equipment! Be wary, <name>.  The Irondeep mine is deep in Alliance territory, and control of the mine is as shifting as the snows of Alterac. "
"Name: A Lovely Apple for Jogu, Objective: Buy a jinyu a drink? A level 15 Valley of the Four Winds Quest.  ","Hey, this is my favorite food! Thanks, <name>. "
"Name: Take the Edge Off, Objective: Raise 6 Champions to 950 Item Level.  ","The demons streaming out of Antorus equip themselves at Felfire Armory. We need to deny those weapons. Will your <class>s fight alongside the Army of the Light once again?

A colleague of mine would like to speak with you about the research you are doing in conjunction with the Cenarion Circle.  He is a druid by the name of Quintis Jonespyre, and he resides in Feathermoon Stronghold, Feralas.  He would like to confer with you about morrowgrain. . . and he very much would like for you to keep our discussion from the ears of the Arch Druid. If you're interested, speak with him; no doubt, all will be revealed once you do. "
"Name: Minshina's Skull, Objective: Retrieve Minshina's skull from the circle of power on the Echo Isles.  ","I hear the voice of my brother, Minshina, calling to me in my dreams. He was taken by Zalazane, the warlock on the Echo Isles to the east. And he is dead. But death is not freedom for my brother. Minshina's spirit was trapped within his own skull by Zalazane's magics. In my dreams I see it with other skulls, in a circle of power on the largest Echo Isle. As long as it remains there my brother's soul is doomed. Please, <name>. Find the circle and retrieve Minshina's skull. Bring it to me. Free him! "
"Name: Riding the Red Rocket, Objective: Commander Howser at the lighthouse in Venture Bay wants you to destroy the Horde lumber shipment.  ","Listen, <name>. This battle is as much over resources as tactical supremacy. I have a mission that could turn the tide in our struggle against the Horde here. There are torpedoes at the end of the dock that we can use to take down the Horde's lumber ship to the northwest. You'll need to get some of the fuel that's stored on the docked goblin ship just north of here, then ride one of the torpedoes into their transport! "
"Name: Securing the Province, Objective: Kill 10 Wildscale Saurok or Wildscale Herbalists in Zhu Province.  ","With our grip on the province loosening, saurok from the wilds have already moved in to the cave just north of town. Most of our hunters are face-down in their own tears, so the saurok just walk in here like they own the place and grab whatever they want!

"Name: Save Our Scouts! , Objective: Rescue the three captured Sunreaver agents within the Ghost Iron Mines, and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.  ","The heavy mogu presence in the mines let us know it was a place of great importance - but we needed to gather more information on their activities there, so we sent agents into the mines to spy on them.

Unfortunately, many were captured, and we've found that some are being tortured in the mines. You have to go rescue them - nobody deserves what they are going through. . .

And, when you finish, kill whoever captured them. No mercy, $p! "
"Name: Of No Consequence, Objective: Rescue 8 Cowering Troopers.  ","Our forces in Pyrewood were recently taken by way of sneak attack. The 7th Legion managed to infiltrate the town with their scouts, ultimately decimating our troops. The Dark Lady has tasked us with a rescue mission. We are to find survivors and get them out of Pyrewood safely. If any soldiers live they are likely worthless, but we do as the Dark Lady commands. Let's get this nonsense over with, <name>. Pyrewood is directly southwest of the Forsaken Front. "
"Name: At the Yak Wash, Objective: Bring 6 Escaped Yaks to the Wash Entrance at Lao & Son's Yak Wash.  ","Look, my father is crazy. I love him, but he's crazy. These yaungol managed to completely obliterate our ranch and scattered our yaks every which way. If I know my father though, he's going to try to go head to head with the yaungol to get the yaks back. Can you help us round up some of the yaks so my father doesn't do anything stupid? Just ride them over to the Yak Wash so we can clean them up and sell them to the grummles. "
"Name: Befouled by Satyr, Objective: Slay 7 Hatefury Rogues, 7 Hatefury Felsworn, 7 Hatefury Betrayers, and 7 Hatefury Hellcallers, and return to Takata Steelblade in Desolace.  ","A demon infestation does not occur without other influences--something else allows evil to gain a foothold. It may start with a weakened spirit, a needless desire for power; perhaps it's a thirst for revenge, or the appeal for final justice. When we are beset by pain, evil takes advantage of us--evil such as the satyr. Ties have been made between them and the Burning Blade, and Thrall would have them slain. Seek them out to the northeast of here, and return to me when you've driven them back. "
"Name: Rites of the Earthmother, Objective: Travel to Seer Graytongue who lives in the hills directly south of Camp Narache.  ","Your willingness to perform a humble task for the tauren of Narache and your eagerness to learn are noble traits, <name>. I believe one day you will be heralded in Thunder Bluff as a <class> of greatness. Before that you must embark on the Rites of the Earthmother, of which there are three. The first test is the Rite of Strength. Travel to Seer Graytongue and tell him Chief Hawkwind has sent you. You will find the seer's abode directly to the south of Camp Narache, tucked away in the hills. "
"Name: Tastes Like Strider, Objective: Collect 9 Jumbo Swampstrider Drumsticks from Swampstriders.  ","You there! Yes, you! You want a good word put in with the Trade Baron? Give me a hand! I heard you're the one that got all those makrura tails. They're wonderful, but not enough for proper swamp food. I need drumsticks for my gumbo! There's plenty of swampstriders just outside town in the Sorrowmurk. I want the biggest drumsticks you can find! "
"Name: The Befouled Element, Objective: Bring the Befouled Water Globe to Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.  ","The slain elemental has produced an intensely glowing globe of water.  The contents of the globe are, at best, disgusting.  It would be safe to assume that whatever has befouled the water of Mystral Lake is most likely present in the water of the globe. It's not exactly common knowledge who might be interested in such a find; perhaps Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, might have an idea. "
"Name: A New Age, Objective: Activate the Crest of Ascension.  ","With the final empowerment in place, our renewed Crest of Ascension stands bolstered by the might of not just Bastion, but all covenants.

Soon new Ascended will grace these halls once more as aspirants finish their long-awaited trials.

None of this would be possible without your aid, Maw Walker. The honor of activating the Crest at last is yours. "
"Name: Looking Forward, Objective: Find and speak to Admiral Dvorek under the southern terrace in the Ruins of Vashj'ir.  ","The Admiral used the information you gathered for him to make a forward post under the terrace to our west. He's been preparing there for some kind of attack against the naga. You should go to him immediately and inform him of the scope of what you've witnessed. Our force is small, and I fear for our soldiers if we charge in too recklessly. Take my sea horse. It knows the way. "
"Name: Investigate the Amani Catacombs, Objective: Investigate the Amani Catacombs and burn 10 Mummified Troll Remains, then return to Ranger Vynna at Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.  ","<class>, our sources tell us that the trolls buried in the Amani Catacombs inside Sungraze Peak have been rising from the dead. I need you to investigate these catacombs and put to the torch any of the unanimated remains you come across so as to prevent any more of these creatures from rising. The fastest way there is to head northwest out of the enclave. This will put you near the western entrance to the catacombs. "
"Name: Only the Beginning, Objective: Kill Glubtok.  ","I miss the days when legions of powerful ogres marched by the Horde's side into battle, the pathetic Alliance cowering at their ferocity. Perhaps those days will return before I am gone to the ancestors. However, that is not the case now. An ogre magi, Glubtok, has joined forces with the despicable Defias Brotherhood and acts as Foreman over their mining operations. The pathetic fool! End his life for me, and for the spirit and glory of the Horde! "
"Name: What the Drust Knew, Objective: Carefully remove the enchantment from the Ancient Drust relic to learn about its construction.  ","Ahoy, <name>!

If you have a moment, I could use your assistance. I've recently received a large shipment of Drust relics that I've been processing.

Most of them have been nothing out of the ordinary, but there is this one that is special. Just holding it makes my hair stand on end. 

With you being my best pupil, I was thinking that it would be fun if we disenchanted it together, to see how it was made.

What do you say? "
"Name: Medallion of Station, Objective: If you need another Twilight cultist's medallion of station, then I am happy to oblige.  ","Here you are, <name>.  One more Twilight medallion of station.  Use it well, and I wish you luck against the Abyssal Council! "
"Name: Land Ho! , Objective: Talk to Captain O'Breen in Faldir's Cove.  ","Lolo sees a tiny <race>! Always on the lookout, Lolo is! Welcome to Faldir's Cove.  Captain O'Breen said we'd only be here for a few hours.  Just long enough to gather the treasure and get back to Booty Bay. But Lolo thinks we're going to be here a lot longer than that.  We lost the other two ships from our formation.  Poor Spirit of Silverpine and Maiden's Folly.  On the bottom of the sea they rest now! Lolo suggests you talk to Captain O'Breen if you plan on sticking around here. "
"Name: Overlord Gorefist, Objective: Ikuti wants you to kill Overlord Gorefist and 10 Ango'rosh Maulers.  ","The centerpiece of any ogre tribe is its leader. Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next. Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom. Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite. "
"Name: Kota Blend, Objective: Collect 100 Kafa'kota Berries from Kota Peak.  ","Kota Peak is famous for its kafa bushes - no other can survive at this elevation. Grummles make very good living selling Kafa'kota Blend, but it's dangerous now thanks to my cousin here. He's got the wildlife up there hooked on kafa with his scheming. Kafa'kota is more scarce than ever with goots gobblin' it up and yetis hoarding it in their caves. I pay you good for any berries you bring down from Kota. Here, take a sample. Eat it. See for yourself the power of kafa. "
"Name: The Soup of Contemplation, Objective: Train the recipe for Swirling Mist Soup from the Master of the Pot, then give her 5 Swirling Mist Soup.  ","Watching over the pot, you get a lot of time to think. Let me show you how to make swirling mist soup and you'll know what I mean. "
"Name: Your Base, Your Choice, Objective: Choose to construct either a Lumber Mill or a Sparring Arena at Beastwatch.  ","You have already constructed an impressive garrison in Frostfire. I believe I should defer this next choice to you. One region of Gorgrond is rich in resources. A lumber mill could help us make the most of them. Another region harbors hardened gladiators. A sparring arena would help persuade them to fight for our cause. Either path will strengthen us as we seek to find and weaken the Iron Horde. Which do you choose, Commander? "
"Name: Stitching Time, Objective: Upgrade Abominaton Factory to Tier 1.  ","With the proper resources we can build a force of construct warriors greater than anything ever seen in the Shadowlands.

Visit Arkadia Moa and see if you can secure the resources we need. "
"Name: Grand Master Payne, Objective: Defeat Major Payne in a pet battle.  ","In my opinion, my fellow tamers have been far too lenient on your training. True pet taming requires militaristic discipline. I shall honor you with the pleasure of seeing firsthand what that discipline can produce. Come to the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown and see firsthand what you could become! "
"Name: Supporting the Troops, Objective: Slay 15 Andorhal Deathguards.  ","I'm no military expert, but this battle looks to be in our favor.  Our defenders are equally matched with their deathguards, but the farmers' militia has taken them by surprise from the rear.  For the Alliance! Still, we should all do what we can to make sure that we win.  Travel east into Andorhal and slay the Forsaken deathguards that are fighting with our men.  The sooner they die, the quicker we can re-take Andorhal! "
"Name: To the Undercity for Yagyin's Digest, Objective: Bring the Sigil of the Hammer to Keeper Bel'dugur in the Undercity.  ","The tablet tells much.  But not enough!  Not nearly enough! There is a book, a digest that Yagyin wrote in ages past.  The. . . people I fled from. . . they keep this book in many places.  And their most learned study it.  It holds vast knowledge.  Knowledge to protect us! Go to Keeper Bel'dugur in the Undercity of Lordaeron.  Show him this sigil and he'll think you one of them.  Ask him for Yagin's Digest. . . and bring it to me! "
"Name: Ears Are Burning, Objective: You are to bring 25 Burning Blade Ears to Sorrem at Furien's Post.  ","Sorrem has made no secret of his disdain for the Burning Blade at Thunder Axe Fortress. Surely, proof of their demise would be of value to him. "
"Name: The Dark that Blinds Us, Objective: Take chalk rubbings of the northern, eastern, western, and southern Tribal Stones in the Whispering Fields.  ","After years of research, there is still so much I do not understand about the Shadowmoon. To the southwest are stone monuments detailing the orcs' history. I'm not able to get close enough to examine the stones, but perhaps you can. If you could take a chalk rubbing of the words written on those stones, and I will reward you handsomely. "
"Name: The Sub-Chieftains, Objective: Defeat Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder, and then report back to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.  ","It is known that Gearmaster Mechazod has four sub-chieftains that manage the robots in the pools. We must put an end to them! Our longrunners and snow trackers say that if you were to turn the valves at the west point, north point, mid point and south point stations, each of his sub-chieftains would come quickly to prevent you from fouling their operations. The stations are centered on the spinning lights in the pools surrounding the pumping station. Hurry, <name>! "
"Name: The Beating Heart, Objective: Deliver the Heart of Gorgorek to Warmaster Zog at your garrison.  ","One thing is certain. We now possess an item of great value to the Iron Horde. We had better secure this. . . ""Heart of Gorgorek"" at once. "
"Name: Master Pit Fighter, Objective: Well met again, &lt; class&gt; .  ",Many foes have you bested and many crowds entertained. I am glad to name you Master Pit Fighter of the Darkmoon Deathmatch! 
"Name: Decisions, Decisions, Objective: You must use The Pewter Pounder to destroy The Pewter Prophet.  ","This is no magic solution to my curse! It's just a hammer! I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid. There's NO WAY I'm gunna use this to break my shiney - not after all I've gone through to get it. < Budd pauses in thought for a moment. >But that means I'm stuck down here for eternity. . . I had just learned to sail, you know. Ohhh. . . I can't decide. Here, you take the hammer and I'll just set the shiney down and look the other way. "
"Name: The Relics of Wakening, Objective: Retrieve the Relics of Wakening.  ","Gnarlpine invaders were seen ravaging the Ban'ethil Barrow Den, tucked in the hill to the west. The slumbering druids will be trapped in the Emerald Dream for eternity, unaware of their fate, unless we help. The delicate hibernation ritual cannot be broken without the Relics of Wakening. Journey to the Den and retrieve the Raven Claw Talisman, Black Feather Quill, Sapphire of Sky, and Rune of Nesting. The druids store them in sacred chests.  Return them to me and I will prepare the awakening ritual. "
"Name: Raene's Cleansing, Objective: Find an uncorrupted furbolg, and using the power of Dartol's Rod of Transformation, speak to him.  ","Alas, I'm not completely certain what he had in mind next. If what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether. Which form, I do not know. Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to the tainted furbolgs, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was safe from the effects of Fel Moss. I would start your search southeast of Mystral Lake. "
"Name: Matchmaker, Objective: Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering wants you to use a Lithe Stalker to throw rocks at Umbral Brutes as they near lesser undead in Malykriss.  ",The major difference between vargul and lesser undead minions is that vargul still possess enough of their minds to despise being used for labor. Never will a vargul be pleased to be working aside skeletons or ghouls. Lets take advantage of this inevitable animosity and start some fights between the umbral brutes and the other undead in Malykriss. That should serve to slow production and bring the death knights down to babysit. Should be simple - throw rocks at the brutes as they near lesser undead. 
"Name: Candied Sweet Potatoes, Objective: Make 5 servings of Candied Sweet Potatoes and bring them to Francis Eaton just outside of Orgrimmar.  ","While you're here, you might want to stock up on Mulgore sweet potatoes. They're used to make delicious candied sweet potatoes, my favorite part of the Pilgrim's Bounty meal. If you don't believe me, look up the recipe in your bountiful cookbook and give it a try. If you're headed back to Orgrimmar, bring them to Francis Eaton at the feasting area just outside the city. I've been trying to keep him supplied, but everything goes so fast over there. "
"Name: Guardian of the Monument, Objective: Collect an Apexis Guardian's Head.  ","You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround. These larger apexis monuments function in much the same way, but they take 35 apexis shards to activate. Of greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use.  These crystal constructs turned on their arakkoan masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la. We would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof. "
"Name: Galen's Escape, Objective: Escort Galen out of danger, then find his camp in the Swamp of Sorrows and open his strongbox.  ","Please help!  These creatures are going to eat me! Help me out of here, and I'll give you a great treasure!  It's in my camp in the swamp north of Stonard, but it's locked in a strongbox that can be opened through a trick that only I know. If you help me escape, then I'll teach it to you. "

"Name: Lament of the Highborne, Objective: Light the second memorial flame.  ","The next memory. . .

Forgive me. For many of our people, it was when we realized death was coming for us.

A memorial to a particular defender lies to the west, in the place of her home. The light there has no doubt attracted some of the area's lingering souls. Clear them out, and then relight the flame. "

"Name: Give it a Little Juice, Objective: Put some voodoo on Cala's formula using Witchdoctor Jangalar's cauldron.  ","Well, I admit that I feel a little better about this. If Witch Doctor Jangalar's voodoo can make Ben'jin react correctly, as the science says he should, then what do we have to lose? Bless my formula or hex it or whatever they call it with Jangalar's voodoo cauldron. "
"Name: Superior Armaments of Battle - Friend of the Dawn, Objective: For 30 Insignias of the Dawn and 30 Insignias of the Crusade you may choose an item from the Argent Dawn's treasure cache.

I must warn you; purchases made at a friendly reputation with the Dawn come with a hefty surcharge. I would advise that you gain a better reputation with the Dawn before moving forward with your plans. "
"Name: Gunpowder Plots, Objective: Collect 6 Kegs of Gunpowder.  ","Since the Lord Admiral iced all of their zeppelins, the Horde are rowing in through the seagate.

The nice, narrow seagate entrance that makes for a great choke point.

I'll have my people haul over a cannon and some ammunition. If you collect some gunpowder, we'll set up behind the gate where they won't expect the attack.

We'll blast the Horde to the bottom of the harbor! "
"Name: Pilfering Perfume, Objective: While disguised as a package-runner, go to the Crown Chemical Company's stockpile outside the gates of Orgrimmar, then return the package they toss you to Detective Snap Snagglebolt in Orgimmar.  ","I knew they were up to no good! There's some sort of mind-affecting chemical in here, but I can't get a handle on it with such a small sample. I need the real stuff.

Don't just go over there and buy it! I don't want you giving these scumbags one copper. Nah, you gotta get it from the source, discreet-like.

I'll disguise you as a package runner. I saw a stockpile guarded by their goons outside the gates. Go run by, and DON'T stop, or they'll make you! They'll toss you a crate. Bring it back here. "
"Name: A Threat Rises, Objective: Pour Havi some grog.  ","It is time I told you another tale. While you listen, would you be so kind as to pour me some grog? I've grown a terrible thirst.

"Name: The Kaliri Whisperer, Objective: Recover the Old Gavel from Skizzik.  ","An important contact lives in the nearby Shadowglade. He is meek, but trains kaliri of monstrous size which are quite dangerous. He once claimed they could knock a rylak out of the sky, but I'll believe that when I see it.
